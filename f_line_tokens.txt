they do not ! 
i hope so . 
let 's go . 
okay -- you 're gon na need to learn how to lie . 
like my fear of wearing pastels ? 
what good stuff ? 
me .   this endless ... blonde babble . i 'm like boring myself . 
do you listen to this crap ? 
well no ... 
i was ? 
you know chastity ? 
who knows ?   all i 've ever heard her say is that she 'd dip before dating a guy that smokes . 
lesbian ?   no . i found a picture of jared leto in one of her drawers so i 'm pretty sure she 's not harboring same - sex tendencies . 
i really really really wanna go but i ca n't .   not unless my sister goes . 
eber 's deep conditioner every two days . and i never ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment . 
you 're sweet . 
i counted on you to help my cause . you and that thug are obviously failing . are n't we ever going on our date ? 
how is our little find the wench a date plan progressing ? 
forget french . 
i do n't want to know how to say that though .   i want to know useful things . like where the good stores are .   how much does champagne cost ?   stuff like chat .   i have never in my life had to point out my head to someone . 
c'esc ma tete . this is my head 
gosh if only we could find kat a boyfriend ... 
unsolved mystery .   she used to be really popular when she started high school then it was just like she got sick of it or something . 
the thing is cameron -- i 'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser .   my sister .   i ca n't date until she does . 
no no it 's my fault -- we did n't have a proper introduction --- 
you 're asking me out .   that 's so cute . what 's your name again ? 
not the hacking and gagging and spitting part .   please . 
can we make this quick ?   roxanne korrine and andrew barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad .   again . 
i did . 
i have to be home in twenty minutes . 
sometimes i wonder if the guys we 're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with you know ? 
combination .   i do n't know -- i thought he 'd be different .   more of a gentleman ... 
he practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist . i mean . dr. bonchowski is great an all but he 's not exactly relevant party conversation . 
would you mind getting me a drink cameron ? 
where did he go ?   he was just here . 
you might wanna think about it 
did you change your hair ? 
you know the deal .   i can ' t go if kat does n't go -- 
hi joey . 
queen harry ? 
patrick -- is that- a. 
is that woman a complete fruit - loop or is it just me ? 
no ! i just wanted 
i just wanted -- 
let go ! 
you looked beautiful last night you know . 
i guess i 'll never know will i ? 
god you 're just like him ! just keep me locked away in the dark so i ca n't experience anything for myself 
i 'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes . 
no . you did n't !   if you really thought i could make my own decisions you would 've let me go out with him instead of helping daddy hold me hostage . 
why did n't you tell me ? 
you did what ? 
as in ... 
but you hate joey 
i wish i had that luxury . i 'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and i ca n't go because you won ' t. 
like you care . 
i do n't get you .   you act like you 're too good for any of this and then you go totally apeshit when you get here . 
i really do n't think i need any social advice from you right now . 
you are so completely unbalanced . 
yeah he 's your freak friend mandella 's boyfriend .   i guess since i 'm not allowed to go out i should obsess over a dead guy too . 
like i 'm supposed to know what that even means . 
ca n't you forget for just one night that you 're completely wretched ? 
bogey lowenstein 's party is normal but you 're too busy listening to bitches who need prozac to know that . 
you 're ruining my life '   because you wo n't be normal i ca n't be normal . 
i think you 're a freak .   i think you do this to torture me .   and i think you suck . 
oh i thought you might have a date   i do n't know why i 'm bothering to ask but are you going to bogey lowenstein 's party saturday night ? 
oh my god does this mean you 're becoming normal ? 
can you at least start wearing a bra ? 
nowhere ... hi daddy . 
i have a date daddy .   and he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know . 
fine .   i see that i 'm a prisoner in my own house .   i 'm not a daughter . i 'm a possession ! 
daddy i want to discuss the prom with you . it 's tomorrow night -- 
daddy no ! 
it 's just a party . daddy . 
daddy people expect me to be there ! 
if you must know we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends . 
daddy i -- 
but she does n't want to date . 
but it 's not fair -- she 's a mutant daddy ! 
what if she never starts dating ? 
now do n't get upset . daddy but there 's this boy ... and i think he might ask ... 
it 's just you . 
what ? to completely damage me ?   to send me to therapy forever ? what ? 
you set me up . 
so did you 
not all experiences are good bianca . you ca n't always trust the people you want to . 
i guess i thought i was protecting you . 
that 's not 
i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him . 
just once .   afterwards i told him i did n't want to anymore .   i was n't ready . he got pissed .   then he broke up with me . 
he said everyone was doing it .   so i did it . 
now i do .   back then was a different story . 
he was like a total babe 
in 9th .   for a month 
joey never told you we went out did he ? 
i do care . but i 'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons not someone else ' s . 
listen i know you hate having to sit home because i 'm not susie high school . 
you 're welcome . 
bianca i need to talk to you -- i need to tell you -- 
can we go now ? 
it 's shakespeare .   maybe you 've heard of him ? 
at least i 'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge - pig . 
what 's normal ? 
what do you think ? 
it means that gigglepuss is playing at club skunk and we 're going . 
i have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you do n't get out of my way . 
where 've you been ? 
leave my sister alone . 
hey -- do you mind ? 
yeah and i noticed the only part of you featured in your big kmart spread was your elbow .   tough break . 
oh honey -- tell me we have n't ' progressed to full - on hallucinations . 
you ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective .   we 're making a statement . 
listen to you !   you sound like betty all pissed off because archie is taking veronica . 
can you even imagine ?   who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess ? 
i got drunk .   i puked .   i got rejected . it was big fun . 
i did bianca a favor and it backfired . 
i did n't have a choice . 
who cares ? 
no fear . 
i appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death but i 'm consuming .   do you mind ? 
neither has his heterosexuality . 
william did n't even go to high school 
so he has this huge raging fit about sarah lawrence and insists that i go to his male - dominated puking frat boy number one golf team school . i have no say at all . 
the people at this school are so incredibly foul . 
i realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking but killing yourself so you can be with william shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions .   you 're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy . 
what 's this ? 
mandella eat .   starving yourself is a very slow way to die . 
block e ? 
i 'm sure he 's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting . 
patrick verona    random skid . 
oh bianca ?   can you get me my freshman yearbook ? 
why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill ? 
is that right ? 
a fender strat . you bought this ? 
really ?   what was it like ?   a down payment now then a bonus for sleeping with me ? 
you were paid to take me out !   by -- the one person i truly hate .   i knew it was a set - up ! 
that ' s completely adorable ! 
look i 'm   -- sorry -- that i questioned your motives .   i was wrong . 
it 's just something i had .   you know 
how 'd you get a tux at the last minute ? 
answer the question patrick 
you tell me . 
create a little drama ?   start a new rumor ?   what ? 
because i do n't want to . it 's a stupid tradition . 
no i wo n't go with you 
is that a request or a command ? 
you 're amazingly self - assured . has anyone ever told you that ? 
no -- something real .   something no one else knows . 
tell me something true . 
i know the porn career 's a lie . 
the duck ? 
state trooper ? 
for . . . ? 
something like that 
i do n't like to do what people expect . then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change . 
acting the way we do . 
yeah well do n't let it get out 
i dazzled him with my wit 
good call . 
the partridge family ? 
you want me to climb up and show you how to get down ? 
put your right foot there -- 
c'm on .   it 's not that bad 
he left !   i sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me . 
other than my upchuck reflex ? nothing . 
do n't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties . 
you 're so -- 
what are you doing here ? 
he just wants me to be someone i 'm not . 
oh so now you think you know me ? 
my father would n't approve of that that 
i should do this . 
why 'd you lie ? 
no you were n't 
were you in jail ? 
when you were gone last year -- where were you ? 
but it 's gigglepuss - i know you like them .   i saw you there . 
you know what they say 
i hate him . 
just let me sit down . 
like you could find one 
you do n't care if i die 
why 're you doing this ? 
this is so patronizing . 
i know just let me sleep 
i just need to lie down for awhile 
i 'm fine . i 'm 
funny you 're the only one 
you know who the raincoats are ? 
that 's what you want is n't it ? 
depends on the topic . my fenders do n't really whip me into a verbal frenzy . 
are you following me ? 
you -- covered in my vomit . 
and why would i do that ? 
i do n't really think you warrant that strong an emotion . 
like where ?   the 7 - eleven on burnside ? do you even know my name screwboy ? 
oh right .   friday . 
my mission in life . 
sweating like a pig actually .   and yourself ? 
when i go ? 
what 's the matter ?   upset that i rubbed off on her ? 
the part where bianca beat the hell out of some guy . 
parts of it . 
no daddy . 
yeah .   she left with some bikers big ones .   full of sperm . 
i want to go to an east coast school ! i want you to trust me to make my own choices .   i want -- 
so what i want does n't matter ? 
because you 're making decisions for me . 
i thought you were punishing me . 
then tell them i had a seizure . 
this from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips ? 
you decided . 
i know . 
am i supposed to feel better ? like right now ?   or do i have some time to think about it ? 
i still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls .   i was merely a spectator . 
expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action . 
william - he asked me to meet him here . 
have you seen him ? 
oh good .   something new and different for us . 
okay okay we wo n't go .   it 's not like i have a dress anyway 
well i guess we 're not since we do n't have dates . 
you did n't 
you did n't have a choice ?   where 's kat and what have you done with her ? 
you went to the party ?   i thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity . 
what 'd he say ? 
you think this 'll work ? 
does it matter ? 
that 's never been proven 
william would never have gone to a state school . 
you could always go with me .   i 'm sure william has some friends . 
but imagine the things he 'd say during sex . 
an attempted slit . 
just a little . 
he always look so 
that 's pat verona ? the one who was gone for a year ? i heard he was doing porn movies . 
who 's that ? 
you think ? 
yeah .   i guess . 
i do n't want to drag you down with me . 
forget about me .   you have enough problems of your own . 
pouring it out ! 
i 'll get my clothes . 
in the kitchen . 
no matter what happens ... i'm glad i met you . 
if you were my boyfriend i 'd suggest you find another girlfriend that is n't going to jail ten - thousand miles away . 
ludwig ?   he 's gay - are you jealous ? 
i 'm sorry . 
are you alright ? 
i 'm sorry .   i did n't mean to ... i'm glad . actually i 'm glad it 's over .   all this time .   hiding .   never being able to look anyone in the eyes . always afraid that someone would find out who i was .   never trusting anyone ... 
you do n't know .   i 'm sorry .   i was desperate .   that 's not me .   i shot a cop .   can you imagine what they 'll do to me when i got to prison ? 
i 'm not a whore .   i 'm not a whore . 
what are you asking me ? 
i came here .   i had no money .   i knew no one .   i could n't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work . they approached me - i could 've made a lot of money .   i considered it but ... it 's not who i am .   they pay me below the table at ludwig 's . 
yes i considered it . 
so ... the station is empty ? 
somewhere else ? 
do you live alone ?   i 've been in these clothes since ... the killings .   could we stop at your place ? i could take a shower ... before i go into custody ? 
are you married ? 
i will if they do n't send me back . 
now i become custody of police department ? 
yes but he was a cop . 
... my little sister and i shared a flat - i came home one night and a man was raping her .   his gun was on the chair ... he came at me and i shot him . 
you 're a cop - you 'll never believe me . 
i 'm from a small town in slovakia .   like the south here .   the police is right a civilian is wrong .   so i fled . 
no no do n't talk to immigration ! 
if i tell you will you arrest me ? 
tamina was a friend of mine .   my shower was broken she let me use theirs . 
i told your partner i ca n't help .   i did n't see anything . 
thank you . 
okay .   and you know what i 'll swing by my place grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours ... how 's that ... would that be a good thing . 
you promise ? 
okay til tonight . 
i love you . 
yeah .   i 'll do that .   as long as you 're not patronizing me . 
no .   no listen to me here .   i want to know what you 're talking about .   you know the shoe thing and the marriages and ... 
okay .   that is great .   but i ca n't go now we 're in the middle of something here . 
oh my g - d they want me to anchor .   they want me to anchor tonight ! 
okay .   okay .   hold that thought just for a second .   they only call me when it 's an emergency .   just hold that thought .   can you call back ? 
no .   tell me what you want to say . 
do n't worry about the damn phone .   i wo n't answer it . 
jesus .   and last week you came over with blood on your shoes .   what am i going to do with you ? 
look at this .   you have blood on your shirt .   whose is it ? 
you 're not so bad yourself . 
well who was it that taught me how to do that ?   huh ? 
that was good .   you were holding the evidence . 
yes you are .   i 'm not just some reporter .   i do n't just stick a microphone in your face .   you could give me something . 
alright alright eddie .   do n't patronize me . 
stop it . 
you did n't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues .   you could give me something . 
what is your problem ?   why 'd you snap at me ?   i just wanted a statement . 
hey honey . 
eddie are you okay ? 
alright cut cut cut . 
do you have the suspect in custody ? 
okay .   but i do understand that your partner leon jackson 's been injured . is that correct ? 
i understand but i noticed that the fire marshall is here with you .   is this somehow related to the fire department ? 
detective - can you tell us what happened here ? 
is it drug related ? 
can we go up to the crime scene ? 
how many victims are up there ? 
detective does it look like a murder ? 
oh my g - d.   we were having lunch here . he started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but i got a call to anchor - and i walked out on him .   i walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him ! ! 
alright .   go ahead . 
i want to hear everything he said . 
what do you mean you know ?   he told you he was gon na propose to me ? 
you 're impossible ... 
tell me . 
where is he ? 
i 've been waiting a long time to hear you say that . 
how 'd they take it back at headquarters ? 
what do i know ?   i 'm just a bartender . 
oh yeah well look where you came when you were down and out . 
when a guy hurts you then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees who knows he might just be irrestible . 
it might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions .   i was in bed with a girlfriend watching tv last week jack and one thing we know about me is i happen not to be a lesbian ... now if this indian 's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him it could just be she 's still vulnerable to him . 
what makes you think they were lesbians or as you so quaintly put it dykes ? 
jack it 's all over the papers . he 's an obvious type .   but this indian ... 
ganz is going to be hard to track . just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed ... totally without any pattern ... kill anybody ... the indian ... himself ... anybody ... 
you real down ? 
i can see that .   pardon me for saying so but you look like shit .   what happened ? 
i ought to have you and your friend thrown out ... 
hey i do n't believe it . 
fuck you . 
jack wait ... 
jack ?   what was that ? 
so am i. 
no wonder you 're so popular . 
i 'm at work asshole .   where else ? 
this is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave . 
just one .   some lady called .   said she 's a little hot - headed sometimes ... but she still wants her occasional roommate . she 'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight ... if it 's humanly possible .... 
i get that . the job first . everything else especially me second . i get it . i do n't like it . 
here it comes again ... the sacred job ... 
look jack if you make everything your personal responsibility you 'll turn into a bad cop .   it 's not a practical way to function ... 
look spare me the macho bullshit about your gun ... 
jack are you okay ? 
you made the front page . 
great place for lunch . 
i think you forgot this . hands him his wallet and badge ... 
yeah for some reason i 'm sure ... 
call me later . 
you know something jack you really are hopeless . 
i wish you 'd stop trying to make me mad so i wo n't care for you ... i wish you 'd give me a little more of a chance . 
when you start with that attitude ... it 's like i do n't know who you are . 
maybe that makes a nice excuse . 
that 's a fairly crummy way to start a morning . 
maybe i would if i knew when you were coming back . 
you know if you let me come over to your place once in a while you could put on a clean shirt in the morning . 
tell me -- i'm dyin ' to hear it . 
if this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems i 'll take brutal indifference . 
are n't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit ? 
then i sit back and i think i mean who 's to say i 'm not a dumb bitch .   i work in a bar right ? i ca n't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze - hound that comes in the place ... you are what you do ... 
irrigated his face with the shot of j and b i 'd just poured him . then i tried to deck the sucker . 
a guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today . 
i 'm all wet . 
you 're hopeless . 
i still do n't think it 's loaded . 
i do n't think your gun 's loaded ... 
what am i wanted for ? 
in all due respect he sounds kind of pathetic to me .   the kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend .   have you two ace detectives checked that out ? 
that 's no bull . 
how would you know ? 
shrink major not a shrink . 
i 'm not so sure i can say the same thing ... you do n't look like a cop . 
who the hell are you ? 
akta dedero ansila do mektet . 
vano da mechteba ? ! soun domo kala chon hammas ! 
ikset - kiba .   me imanetaba oum dalat ! 
san agamat chay bet ... envolet ! 
napoleon ... small . 
corn - i - lius ? 
tell me ... 
why ? ... why would you need me ? 
i have thousands of memories but none of them are mine ... there is no need for me other than this . i 'm immortal but i have no life . 
but i do n't know love ... i 'm like a machine programmed to save other people 's lives but never to have one of my own . 
... like love ... 
what 's the use of saving lives ... when you see what you do with them ! 
i want to sleep ... forever ... 
i 'm so tired ... 
... the rain falls ... 
the wind blows ... the fire burns ... 
protect life ... until death . 
five hundred wars ... arms ... drugs ... money ... everything you create is used to destroy ... 
i 'm so very sad . 
you 're nothing but a ... a ... 
and you ca n't concentrate with me around ? . 
i 'm going to see the diva sing . what 's the matter ? ... do i look bad ? 
ok you can turn around ! 
yes ... you know there 's a lot of differences between men women . 
you know women normally change five times more than men . 
... hoppi - hoppa . 
yes ! now it 's your turn ! i learned your language you have to learn mine ! 
all 900 . 
learning language . 
what is ... make love ? 
dinoine chagantakat ! 
valo massa ... chacha hamas . 
she died in her sleep three days ago .   it was in the paper ... 
tom ... she 's dead . 
who are you calling ? 
what was i supposed to think happened to you ? ! 
you 're killing me ... 
look where we are .   look at yourself .   you son of a bitch you do n't have any idea what you 're putting me through ... 
you should have . 
no i do n't because you 're not telling me anything ! 
you could n't ? 
you owe me an explanation .   you ca n't treat me like this . 
you 're sorry ?   what was i supposed to think ? 
why have n't you called ?   why do n't you answer your phone ? 
what 's going on tom ?   what happened ? 
what happened to you ? 
... what 's going on ? 
what 's wrong ?   are you alright ? 
tom ?   where have you been ... ? 
why the gun ? 
i know . 
i understand . 
betty 's out of town so we 're playing next week . 
you 're not using the same guy who tried to fix it ? 
you think you 'll have time for the water heater this weekend ? 
i love you . 
you better not be smoking that 's all i can say . 
how 's the detective business ? 
okay i believe you . 
i 'm not accusing you ... 
figure it out ? ! ? !   i 'll be insane before i figure it out .   the only thing i 'm sure of is that i ca n't go to sleep .   not while he 's using me . 
i ca n't go back to sleep again . 
it is ... was . it 's a zapper it might help me stay awake . 
i ca n't find him . 
it was bad . 
what 's wrong ? 
rick ... i ca n't . 
but she would n't let dad treat me like that . 
i do n't want to . 
kristen what happened ? 
you what ? 
when they 're all you have you kinda become an expert . 
i daydream .   you have to dream about some place fun .   remember you 're in control . 
no really it 's a fable .   the ' guardian of good ' dreams .   it was like my teddy bear when i was growing up . 
my mom taught me when i was little .   did you ever hear of the dream master ? 
i love to dream i just hate ones about my dad . 
i 'm sure they 're around . 
here you are .   where were you this morning ?   rick 's looking all over for you . 
then you saw him too ? 
you 've been up all night ? 
we have matching luggage . 
i know . 
i know .   i hardly have any time to study . 
you in a hurry ? 
save it for later .   come on ! 
debbie .   she 's gone .   i've ... collected her like the others . 
here we are . 
he 's going after debbie .   i got ta stop him . 
it 's okay we 're just about there . 
you just feel sorry for me . 
he 's going after debbie i got ta stop him . 
try what other kids did .   keep each other awake .   we 'll meet at debbie 's tonight . at least if we do n't sleep he ca n't get us . 
yeah right .   let 's trade death by freddy for life in a rubber room .   adults wo n't see it . they ca n't . 
you do n't really get it .   he 's not a nightstalker .   it 'll take more than bench presses to beat him . 
i do n't think so .   i guess this is my own war . 
not really . 
kristen was the last child left of the people who killed freddy .   maybe freddy ca n't get to new kids without someone like me .   someone to bring them to him . 
three days . 
the story is the deaths you ca n't argue with . 
look you know why you just do n't believe me . 
i 've been working double shifts . 
no do n't !   i gave sheila to him and now she 's dead ! 
i was there in the dream .   he took her . it was awful .   it was awful ... 
it was no suicide .   it was not an accident .   it was freddy and he 's coming back for seconds thirds and fourths . 
i know .   uh ... alice . 
rick stayed later after school with kristen .   she was n't feeling very well . 
i saw it . it was my dream .   i brought sheila in ... 
it was freddy . 
i think sheila 's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them . 
rick please . 
you 're not taking my baby ! 
look i appreciate what you 're offering but no .   he is my responsibility . 
what i what ?   well i 've thought about it .   i plan to keep him . 
it 's okay dan 
but how ... ? 
what do you mean ? 
where is he ? 
come on downstairs .   he wo n't hurt you . he needs us both . 
who says i do n't like you ? 
who said i ... wait what ? 
oh ... i'm sure that 's not true .   i 'll bet she 's very worried about you .   i would be . 
i do n't think this is a nice place for you to be .   maybe we should go find your mom . 
is that who you 're waiting for ? 
hi you do n't look very well .   are you feeling all right ? 
how did you know that ? 
my name is ... 
should n't you be in your room jacob ? 
me too . 
you 're right . 
yeah ... i guess . 
no .   well not exactly ... it 's that ... i felt like i was n't in control .   for the first time since ... all that .   i 'm scared . 
nothing ... it 's just ... i did n't see my father at the ceremony . 
i know . 
the tickets . 
jesus !   do n't do that ! 
but dad -- 
i 've got to go . 
you disappointed in me ? 
since when are you such a smart shopper ? 
very funny . 
how was the meeting ? 
daddy he 's coming back ... krueger 's coming back .   make them understand . 
it 's just across the park . 
thanks for everything dad . 
to take a picture . 
that 's in the past .   unless you 've stopped going to the meetings . 
i was afraid you were n't coming . 
that 's okay .   he 's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep . 
so did dan . 
we 've got to go to the asylum and find her body .   mark said her soul 's trapped with it -- that 's why she ca n't come to me .   it must be ! 
jacob .   we 've got to get to amanda before it 's too late . 
if they actually bothered to bury her . 
are you alright ? 
that 's the only reason you 're alive ... 
goddamn it yvonne !   you do n't just run away from this guy !   he finds you in your dreams . 
what do you think i 'm doing ?   look .   whether you believe it or not krueger is back .   he 's after the baby and if i do n't try to do something about it who will ? ? 
krueger is reality . 
i just ca n't figure out how he 's getting in when i 'm awake ... 
mark knows i 'm not crazy .   ask him to show you his hands . 
i think krueger 's trying to do something to it . 
i do n't understand what 's happening . krueger has to use my dreams but he got to dan and greta while i was awake . how 's he doing it ? 
no accident .   i tried to warn all of you about krueger . 
what 's that got to do with it ? 
did everyone call everyone ? 
he must 've wandered up from the children 's ward .   i just wondered what was wrong with him . 
have you visited the little boy on my floor ?   jacob the one who looks kind of sad ? 
it was no accident .   it was krueger .   he used to get in through my dreams but not anymore .   he 's found some other way . 
good to see you again mr. grey .   i 've got to go find dan . 
no the dan part was nice ... 
had kind of a long night . 
i do n't understand . 
poor woman ... 
but i 've seen her grave . 
no it 's our problem mark .   if i do n't deal with this they really might try to take jacob .   you said she committed suicide ? 
they think i 'm nuts . 
i could n't do that mark .   he 's my last link with dan ... no i want him . 
where are you going ? 
i do n't know ! 
my baby ! 
why do n't i go make some coffee .   there 's a lot to tell . 
it was n't her mother .   the only reason we 're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party . 
nobody thinks that . 
she must 've fallen asleep at the table ... 
i want to talk to both you guys about greta .   and ... 
mark are you okay ? 
that 's why it 's my fault dan 's dead . 
my dad 's got this thing about drinking in the house . 
not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis . 
give up mark it 's hopeless . 
he sure loves to stay awake . 
you do good work alice . 
but how are we gon na -- 
you think that 's the place she 's buried ? 
yeah ... so that 's him .   and you 're not crazy . 
look ... we're all tired .   none of us had any sleep since friday night ... 
all i know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman .   why do n't you take off - leave springwood and cool out somewhere for a while ? 
and so is your baby .   you 've got more than just yourself to think of now ! 
i am your friend and i 'm worried sick about you .   but you 're like a locked safe .   you 've got ta start dealing with reality . 
i really think you need to calm down now okay ? 
oh alice ... no .   honey i love you but you 're going to have to get a hold of yourself ... 
you had me scared on the phone .   what 's wrong with the baby ? 
why do n't you two stick to reality . 
it was just an accident .   like with dan . 
when dan died you were n't even asleep . you said so .   end of story . 
they 're waiting for us ... but let 's keep this dream stuff between you and me . 
there are n't any little boys on your floor . 
alice it 's no dream .   i 'm sorry ... dan 's dead . 
yeah before they revoke his diploma . 
dan keeping you up again ?   put a lock on that window girl . 
hey what 's wrong with you -- let 's see a smile . 
all of us .   right ? 
look .   dan 's parents were pushing him . pushing him hard .   he was bitching about it at the party last night .   he was under pressure .   we all are . 
stop saying that it 's bullshit . 
naah i 'm done .   got to be on shift in a couple hours .   are n't you going in ? 
that means they 're gon na give me the key to the pool so i can lock up when i 'm done . 
all right kids i tell you what we 're gon na do .   i 've got swimming practice until six - thirty today ... 
makes you look like a nun-- 
you too ? 
it 's okay . 
i ca n't listen to this . 
two hours a day six days a week . 
all the figures show is that gordon lariviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as selectman . in a year or two you wo n't recognize this town . 
i went down to concord to check it out . the president is mel gordon . the vice - president and treasurer is gordon lariviere . those boys are buying up the mountain wade . $ 364000 this year . i believe that 's out of lariviere 's league . 
this is from three years ago . some difference huh ? 
has anybody offered to buy it ? 
about jack ? no . have you checked out the tax bill on your father 's farm lately ? 
sometimes things are simpler than you think . let me ask you a question . 
always has been . 
well you look ... sad . upset . i do n't mean to pry . i 'm sorry about your mother . it was a nice funeral . 
are you alright wade ? 
been putting my files into it . you take sugar and milk ? 
i want to go home . 
you 're a policeman . 
that 's illegal you know . 
i want to go home . 
what are you sorry for ? 
okay . so we 'll get what you want . what do you want ? 
same thing daddy . mommy says -- 
mommy wo n't let me eat fast food . you know that . it 's bad for you . 
it 's pretty old . 
are we going in this ? 
that 's fine with me too . when mommy comes tell her i 'm up here . 
i told her i wanted to come home . daddy do n't be mad at me . 
see i knew you 'd be mad . 
i ... because i want to go home . she said she 'd come and get me . 
i called mommy . 
i do n't want to be here . do n't worry i love you daddy i do . but i want to go home . 
no i did n't see anybody i know . no i do n't want to go to school here tomorrow . i want to go home . 
i want to go home .   i do n't like it here . 
it 's stupid . 
it 's not that . 
i do n't want to . 
no . she does n't talk about you anymore . 
i just think you used to be bad . 
i bet you did lots of bad things . 
but it 's not funny now . 
was it funny ? 
did you do that when you were a kid ? 
yeah . it 's stupid . 
you know . 
why do they do that ? 
i do n't care . they 're out . 
look . those kids are still trick - or- treating . they 're still out . 
who 's fault is it then if it 's not yours ? you 're the one in charge daddy . 
do n't be silly . hi jill . 
i 'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that 's built up . for the rummage sale . and some things for the cleaners . and the laundromat . 
i heard you talking . you got fired this morning did n't you ? 
what on earth is happening to you ? why are you acting this way ? 
what happened ? 
think they 're alright ? 
are you sure they 're home ? did you call ? 
i know your parents . 
did you tell them ?   that we were coming ? 
alright . i 'll think about it . 
you 've been married twice -- 
oh wade . 
then ... i guess you have to . 
do n't you think do you still think it 's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now ? 
it 's nice . 
what way ? 
you knew me as a kid . 
but not now . 
you would n't have done anything like that shot someone for money . 
the mafia hire jack hewitt ? 
jack would n't kill for it . besides who would pay him ? 
jack does n't need money . 
wade ! how can you even think such a thing ? why would jack hewitt do that shoot twombley on purpose ? 
... jack 's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry . he used to be a sweet kid but it 's like when he found out he could n't play ball anymore he changed . now he 's like everyone else . 
i heard he was drunk at toby 's last night and got in a fight with hettie . he drove off without her ... 
jack 's sort of sensitive i guess . more than most . but he 'll be okay in a few weeks . 
call me . 
no you do n't . you 're pissed that 's all . you ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with lillian . you know ? work it out with her tell her how you feel . lillian 's not out to get you . 
you do n't mean that . 
i 'm sorry . 
about you and jill and needing a third person . she went back to lillian ? 
i 'm sorry about what i said . 
you okay ? 
you okay ? 
do n't worry . i can protect my virtue . i mean c'm on wade give me a break . 
you two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party give me a call okay ? i 'm off . 
how 's she doing ? 
new hat ?   jill 's up i see . 
can -- ? 
when did she die ? 
maybe wade should take a look at it . your pipes'll freeze .   wade would you do that ? 
you 're not using it today ? 
have you been heating the house ? not just with the stove . 
ted the lever ! 
not when i 'm with you ted . 
what will happen to him ted ? 
you mean ... 
simon just ejected ! 
i just want you to know i love you ted and always will . 
that was very well put ted . 
i mean until we start to burn up . 
ted we 've only got ten minutes . 
ted please be careful . 
ted there 's no time to explain . 
ted a toilet 's not going to kill anyone . 
i 'd use the word insane . 
the word is sick .   ted -- very very very sick . 
i 've never used the word insane ted . 
ted get a grip on yourself .   you should never have left the hospital . 
we ca n't go back .   we had something very special but it 's all over . 
ted .   i do n't know why you got on this flight .   i do n't know what you 're trying to prove . 
what are you doing ted ? 
ted we 're taking off ! 
ted !   what are you ... ? 
goodbye ted .   i do n't want to hurt you . 
if that 's the way you want it . 
ted you must remember what the doctor said the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you 're sick .   now take your electro - shock and you 'll be back at the space center in no time .   and by the way ted i 'm leaving you for simon . 
and when are you going to realize ted that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now . 
who 's that ted ? 
eat this spaghetti ted .   it 'll make you feel a lot better . 
ted i loved you and i 'll always love you . but i need simon .   he 's stable .   he 's a good provider .   i want that at this stage of the game ted .   he might have his faults but simon does n't know the meaning of the word fear and i need that in a man . 
ted please .   you 're just making things difficult for yourself . 
let 's relax tonight just the two of us . i 'll make a quiet italian dinner just the way you like it with spaghetti . 
ted you 're overworked .   you 've been flying yourself into the ground . 
ted what 's wrong ? 
but ted the invitations have already gone out . 
te ... ! 
is he making any progress doctor ? 
is that a good sign doctor ? 
i mean for ted . 
what can < u > i</u > do doctor rumack ? 
ted seemed to get worse after i told him about simon doctor . 
simon what are you saying ? ! 
simon i did n't want it to end like this . we can be friends !   you 'll die out there . 
your career !   what about the lives of those people out there .   simon what happened to the man i thought i loved ? 
ca n't we change course ? 
simon what 's happening ? ! 
simon i 'm going to check rok 's secondary readout unit . 
i think so . 
do n't be too long . 
simon why has he become so ... so ... 
no i 've been excited before . 
i 'm so excited simon . 
but darling they 've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the jupiter probe . 
and i can hardly believe that i 'm engaged to someone like you simon .   i 'm a very lucky woman . 
no i mean you can do it from the cockpit . 
you can do it from up here captain . 
we have to disconnect rok 's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system . 
i do n't think we have any alternative captain . 
yes sir . 
request ; self - analysis of rok hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes . 
request ; life support systems check . 
request ; comprehensive electrical systems check . 
go ahead . 
that 's okay rok . 
that 's not possible . 
that does n't make sense .   repeat analysis . 
no . no one that i know of . 
just how serious is it doctor ? 
he had fish too . 
doctor rumack mister hammen ate fish . and randy says there are five more cases and they ate fish too . 
he had fish . 
well we had a choice . steak or fish . 
a hospital ? what is it ? 
we have some passengers who are very sick . could you come and take a look at them ? 
sir . excuse me sir . i 'm sorry to have to wake you . are you a doctor ? 
uh - huh . 
the gear is down . 
i wanted you to know -- now -- i 'm very proud . 
but ted you 're the only ... 
what happened ted ? what went wrong ? 
it 's a damn good thing you do n't know how much he hates your guts . 
sluggish . like a wet sponge . 
and a little ice ! 
ted ! what are you doing ? you ca n't fly this plane ! 
ted i do n't want to stay here . it 's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war . 
what 's his problem ? 
be patient ted . no one expects you to get over this immediately . 
seven . lieutenant zipp died this morning . ted doctor sandler says you 'll be out in a week . is n't that wonderful ? 
it 's a big building where the generals meet . but that 's not important right now . they 've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid . is n't that good news ? 
you got a telegram from head­quarters today . 
but it wo n't be . not as long as you insist on living in the past ! 
mostly i remember ... the nights when we were together . i remember how you used to hold me ... and how i used to sit on your face and wriggle ... and then afterwards how we 'd watch until the sun came up . when it did it was almost like ... like each new day was created ... only for us . 
i remember everything . all i have are memories . 
i love you . 
oh ted please be careful . i worry about you so much . 
what 's the matter ? 
you ... you should n't have come . i do n't have time now . 
ted what are you doing here ? 
it 's too late ted . when i get back to chicago i 'm going to start my life all over again . i 'm sorry . 
it 's the truth . what 's hurt you the most is your record since the war . different cities different jobs and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility . 
your < u > war</u > < u > record</u > ? you 're the only one keeping that alive . for everyone else it 's ancient history . 
then why do n't you take the job that louie netz offered you at boeing ? 
i wo n't be back . i 've requested the atlanta run . 
it takes so many things to make love last . most of all it takes respect . and i ca n't live with a man i do n't respect ! 
i have been patient and i 've tried to help but you would n't even let me do that . 
i just do n't want to go over it any more . 
i think so but i 've never seen it so acute . 
who wants to be first ? 
we 'd better get back now . 
we have a visitor . 
you did okay bishop . 
she 's alive .   they brought her here and you know it . 
we're not leaving ! 
how much time ? 
it 's going to be closer .   you better get going . 
all right .   let 's get on it .   what 'll you need ? 
and it 's too late to shut it down ? 
how long until it blows ? 
could it be intelligent ? 
you 're saying one of those things lays all the eggs ? 
but these things come from eggs ... so where are all the eggs coming from . 
which would mean lots of those parasites right ?   one for each person ... over a hundred at least . 
now let me get this straight . the aliens paralyzed the colonists carried them over there cocooned them to be hosts for more of those ... 
sorry to disappoint you . 
you sent them out there and you did n't even warn them burke . why did n't you warn them ? 
you sent them to that ship .   i just checked the colony log ... directive dates six - twelve - seventy - nine . signed burke carter j. 
but they will know about it burke . from me .   just like they 'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty - seven colonists here -- 
you just try getting a dangerous organism past icc quarantine . section 22350 of the commerce code . 
this operation is under military jurisdiction and hicks is next in chain of command .   right ? 
what rank ?   i believe corporal hicks has authority here . 
you son of a bitch . 
they can bill me .   i got a tab running .   what 's second ? 
why not ? 
no good .   how do we know it 'll effect their biochemistry ?   i say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit .   it 's the only way to be sure . 
that 's not what i mean .   gorman if your men have to use their weapons in there they 'll rupture the cooling system . 
they 're right under the primary heat exchangers . 
that the atmosphere processor ? 
i hope you 're right .   i really do . 
you never said anything about an android being here !   why not ? 
burke just tell me one thing . that you 're going out there to kill them .   not study .   not bring back .   just burn them out ... clean ... forever . 
no !   the answer is no .   now please go .   i 'm sorry .   just go would you . 
spare me burke .   i 've had my psych evaluation this month . 
if i go . 
it 's all i could get .   anyway it keeps my mind off of ... everything .   days off are worse . 
that 's right . 
yeah yeah .   i saw the commercial . 
what about you ?   what 's your interest in this ? 
i was reamed steamed and dry - cleaned by you guys ... and now you want me to go back out there ?   forget it . 
no .   there 's no way ! 
they had their minds made up before i even went in there . they think i 'm a head case . 
i get the picture . 
you read my deposition ... it 's complete and accurate . 
is she ... ? 
have they located my daughter yet ? 
fifty - seven ... oh christ ... 
forget it . 
how do you feel ? 
they 're but off !   do something ! 
get them out of there !   do it now ! 
so ... then the fusion containment shuts down . 
i do n't know . 
gorman !   give it a rest would you . 
one of us ? 
the structure seems intact .   they have power . 
how may drops is this for you lieutenant ? 
hicks do n't let him leave . 
no !   no !   she 's alive !   we have to -- 
they learned .   they cut the power and avoided the guns .   they must have found another way in something we missed . 
get back here both of you .   fall back to operations . 
you know burke i do n't know which species is worse .   you do n't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage . 
the only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back .   then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked . 
look you started this .   now show me everything .   i can handle myself . 
what 's this ? 
hicks i 'm not going to wind up like those others .   you 'll take care of it wo n't you it if comes to that ? 
they 'll get us . 
but they do n't know that .   they 're probably looking for other ways to get in .   that 'll take them awhile . 
now many ? 
on my way . 
that 's right .   so we put up welded barricades at these intersections ...   ... and seal these ducts here and here .   then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units here . 
all right .   there 's a fire door at this end .   the first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door . 
how long after we 're declared overdue can we expect a rescue ? 
removed surgically before embryo implantation .   subject :   marachuk john l.    died during procedure .   they killed him getting it off . 
ca n't be .   that 's inside the room ! 
they 're right on us .   vasquez how you doing ? 
i do n't know an acid hole in a duct .   something under the floors not on the plans . i do n't know ! 
seal the door . 
just get back here ! 
they cut the power . 
well then somebody 's just going to have to go out there .   take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually . 
what about the colony transmitter ? that up - link tower down at the other end .   why ca n't we use that ? 
i do n't care how !   think of a way .   think of something . 
we need the other drop - ship .   the on one the sulaco .   we have to bring it down on remote somehow . 
this service tunnel is how they 're moving back and forth . 
she survived longer than that with no weapons and no training . 
you ca n't help them .   right now they 're being cocooned just like the others . 
looks like it stung him . 
the embryo the second form hosts in the victim 's body for several hours .   gestating .   then it ...   ... then it ... emerges .   moults . grows rapidly -- 
no .. i 've slept enough . 
how long have i been on gateway station ? 
yes honey .   i think we both can . 
that 's right . 
right here baby .   right here . 
newt i want you to hang on now .   hang on tight . 
newt wait ! 
do you know how to get to the landing field from here ? 
burke !   open the door ! 
i know honey .   me too . 
sssh .   do n't move .   we 're in trouble . 
newt .   newt wake up . 
i 'll be right in the other room newt .   and look ... i can see you on that camera right up there . 
yes .   a little girl . 
no it 's different honey . 
i do n't know newt .   that 's the truth . 
well some kids ca n't handle it like you can . 
yes there are are n't there . 
oh .   sorry newt . 
now you just lie here and have a nap .   you 're exhausted . 
i 'm sorry newt . 
you 're really something ace . 
the ' maze ' ?   you mean the air ducts ? 
cross my heart . 
newt .   look at me ... newt .   i wo n't leave you .   i promise . 
they 'd be here if they could honey .   i know they would . 
why not ? 
what about me ? 
what did you say ? 
sweet jesus . 
how many colonists ? 
what are you talking about . what people ? 
why wo n't you check out lv-426 ? 
... because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew within twelve hours of hatching ... 
look i can see where this is going .   but i 'm telling you those things exist .   back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs .   thousands . do you understand ?   i suggest you find it using the flight recorder 's data .   find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise ... 
that 's because i blew it out the goddamn airlock !   like i said . 
look i told you ... 
can we dream ? 
are we going to sleep now ? 
mommy ... mommy ? 
i knew you 'd come . 
this way .   come on we 're almost there ! 
sure .   go left . 
come on .   crawl faster . 
mommy ... i mean ripley ... i'm scared . 
wah ... ?   where are ... ? 
do n't go !   please . 
you mean dead . 
where is she ? 
did you ever have a baby ? 
is n't that how babies come ? i mean people babies ... they grow inside you ? 
did one of those things grow inside her ? 
why do they tell little kids that ? 
my mommy always said there were no monsters .   no real ones .   but there are . 
ripley ... she does n't have bad dreams because she 's just a piece of plastic . 
i do n't want to ... i have scary dreams . 
you do n't have to be sorry .   it was n't your fault . 
i guess we 're not leaving right ? 
yeah you know .   in the walls under the floor .   i was the ace .   i could hide better than anybody . 
i was the best at the game . i knew the whole maze . 
and hope to die ? 
you promise ? 
they 're dead . 
because you 'll be gone soon like the others .   like everybody .   you 'll be dead and you 'll leave me alone . 
i do n't want you for a friend . 
casey .   she 's my only friend . 
newt .   my n - name 's newt . nobody calls me rebecca except my dork brother . 
meaning you did n't like it . 
what did you think of the music ? 
how was i ? tell me honestly . 
nothing ! he can marry who he pleases . i do n't give a damn . 
the marriage ! 
did you know ? had you heard ? 
looks do n't concern me maestro . only talent interests a woman of taste . 
what does he look like ? 
oh . well perhaps you could introduce us anyway . 
turkish ? oh if it 's turkish that 's different . i want to be in it . 
what 's that ? 
why not ? 
how do you know ? 
is there a part for me ? 
and he 's been commissioned to write an opera . is it true ? 
well i heard you met herr mozart . 
well ? how do you like it ? it 's turkish . my hairdresser tells me everything 's going to be turkish this year ! 
no no no no . you ca n't take him away now . this is his night . wo n't you introduce us wolfgang ? 
i assume she 's the virtuoso in that department . there ca n't be any other reason you 'd marry someone like that . 
is she a good fuck ? 
i 'm so relieved . 
is her mother still lying on the floor ? 
do n't bother . 
do n't bother ! 
i feel wrong . i feel wrong being here . 
i want to go back to vienna . 
i want to go ! 
please ! let me sit here . let me stay here with you . i promise i wo n't say all word . i 'll just be here so you know no one 's going to hurt you . please please ! 
why not ? 
give me one reason i can understand . 
oh yes sir . he 's all right . and he 's working on it very hard . 
why not ? 
what 's that ? oh !   who gave you this ? how much is it ? wolfi who gave you this ? 
i heard voices . 
who was that ? 
shut up ! i 'll not let you put anything in my hand until i see some money . 
half the house ! you 'll never see a penny . i want it here in my hand . 
i do n't trust this man . and i did n't like what he did with your opera . it was common . 
when ? we need money now . either he pays now or you do n't do it . 
you 're not going to do this ? 
i 'm talking about now . how much will you give him now ? down payment ? 
your father is dead . 
wolfi ! your father is dead . 
these gentlemen are from salzburg . 
no it 's right he should hear . i 'm sick to death of it . we ca n't do anything right for you can we ? 
look old man you stay out of this . we spend a fortune on you more than we can possibly afford and all you do is criticize morning to night . and then you think you can - 
she wo n't talk to me . she says she has to speak to you . 
i do n't know . 
there 's a young girl to see you . 
wolfi i think your father 's tired . i 'll cook us something here . 
may i offer you some tea herr mozart ? 
stop it wolfi . i look dreadful . welcome to our house herr mozart . 
i love you ! i love you ! 
tell them to go ! 
tell them to go away . i do n't want to see anybody . 
this is n't pride . it 's sheer stupidity ! 
all they want to see is your work . what 's wrong with that ? 
how are we going to live wolfi ? do you want me to go into the streets and beg ? 
well i 'm not borrowing any more money from my mother and that 's that ! 
no they will not . i know how things work in this city . 
one royal pupil and the whole of vienna will come flocking . we 'd be set up for life ! 
i think you 're mad ! you 're really mad ! 
excuse me wolfi . mama is not feeling very well . can we leave now ? 
eat my - ah ! 
tub - but i - tub - but i vol - love but i love ui - you . i love you ! 
iram - marry em - marry me ! no no ! you 're a fiend . i 'm not going to marry a fiend . a dirty fiend at that . 
no i 'm not playing this game . 
sra - i'm - sick . sick - kiss i 'm - my kiss my ! sra - i'm - sick - kiss my arse ! 
yes you are . you 're very sick . 
oh ha ha ha . 
do you think that 's funny ? 
that 's stupid . 
why not ? 
your grace i 've got something to tell you . i want to complain about this man . 
no ! no ! no ! 
stop it ! 
i regret we have no servants to show you out herr salieri . respect my wish and go . 
he 's not going to work on this anymore . it is making him ill . please . 
this is not his handwriting . 
and i 'm asking you - 
no he does n't . and i do n't want you here . just go please . 
well thank you very much . you can go now . 
why you ? 
what are you doing here ? 
should we stay here ? it 's a charming room . i love these candlesticks . were they here earlier ? i did n't notice them i suppose i was too nervous . 
i do apologize for this afternoon . i behaved like a silly girl . where shall we go ? 
but ! i 'm a married woman ! 
what do you mean ? 
what for ? 
oh thank you sir ! 
oh yes . he 's really proud of his work . 
yes sir . he does n't make copies . 
that 's very tempting but it 's impossible i 'm afraid . wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing . you see they 're all originals . 
thank you very much your excellency . 
sir we really need this job . we 're desperate . my husband spends far more than he can ever earn . i do n't mean he 's lazy - he 's not at all - he works all day long . it 's just ! he 's not practical . money simply slips through his fingers it 's really ridiculous your excellency . i know you help musicians . you 're famous for it . give him just this one post . we 'd be forever indebted ! 
no sir . this is my own idea . 
my husband is a proud man sir . he would be furious if he knew i 'd come . 
i - i really can not do that your excellency . you see he does n't know i 'm here . 
would it be too much trouble sir to ask you to look at them now ? while i wait . 
he 's terribly busy sir . 
that 's right your excellency . i 've come on behalf of my hus band . i 'm - i 'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment . 
oh yes and who are you ? he 's worked for kings . for the emperor .   who are you ? 
money ! money ! 
you know what 's ridiculous ? your libretto that 's what 's ridiculous . only an idiot would ask wolfi to work on that stuff ! 
he 's doing his best . 
leave him alone ! 
he 's not in . but he 's working on it . he said to tell you . 
not at all . 
how much will you pay him ? 
do you hear him ? do you ? 
oh now i 'm a bad housekeeper ! 
and so you do ! the only time you come out is to eat . 
well this is none of your business .   whoever sent you is going to pay no ? 
what is ridiculous ? wolfi has many admirers in vienna . they love him here . people send us gifts all the time . 
in three months ! papa . 
oh yes . 
please do n't ask me to go back again . i 'm frightened ! i 'm very very frightened . 
i suppose so . he sits there all he time doing some silly opera . 
i 'm frightened sir . really ! when he speaks he does n't make any sense . you know he said he saw - he said he saw his father . and his father 's dead . 
here in his stomach . they bend him right over . 
i do n't know . he has pains . 
you do n't know what it 's like . herr mozart frightens me . he drinks all day then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse . 
i 'm leaving . i 'm not working there anymore . i 'm scared ! 
in there sir . 
i think i 've found out about the money sir . 
oh i would n't know that sir . 
oh yes sir all day long . he never leaves the house until evening . he just sits there writing and writing . he does n't even eat . 
not that i 've seen . 
oh thank you sir . 
madame cavalieri is here for her lesson sir . 
yes thank you sir . 
i will sir . 
good morning sir . 
yes . i can live in or out just as you wish . 
they 'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous . 
my name is lorl sir . i 'm a maidservant . i was asked to come here and offer my services to you . 
are you herr mozart ? 
thank you . 
you know did he seem depressed ? do you think he 'll eat the food ? 
how did he look ? 
has the patient in twenty - one gotten his tray yet ? 
what shall we do ? 
no a cab will be faster . 
he 's fine . we 'll come right over . 
yes doctor . 
yes i should think so . 
no not really . 
no why ? 
yes he is . he 's very excited and confused but he 's not crazy if that 's what you mean . 
he does n't remember . he woke up at the zoo . 
he 's here . 
what shall we do ? 
dr. hirsch ? 
surely you 're not suggesting ... 
no . he knows no one in london besides me . i should n't have left him alone . 
and what else ? 
dr. hirsch what 's wrong ? is this more serious than i know ? 
david says jack comes to warn him . 
well yes but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend . 
he 's not ? 
at my flat . i 'm off at midnight and ... 
yes sir . 
it 's all right susan . yes doctor i have . 
yes i believe he did . 
no sir . of course sir . good day doctor . 
what happened to them ? 
he said ' jack ' . 
yes doctor ? 
yes doctor . 
dr. hirsch ? 
dr. hirsch mr. kessler cried out a minute ago . 
david do n't lose control . 
david let 's go now . 
sir he 's very upset . his friend was killed and ... 
we had an argument . he 's being silly . 
he 's playing a stupid joke sir . 
david please be rational . let 's go to dr. hirsch . 
jack is dead ! 
david stop ! 
david what are you doing ? 
dr. hirsch will know what to do . 
the next corner we can get a cab . 
do n't you remember ? 
the zoo ? 
david ! where on earth have you been ! ? ! 
i 'm off . there 's food in the fridge . 
i 've left those pills for you . 
listen if you get too anxious call me at the hospital okay ? 
david do you want me to stay here tonight ? 
it 's silly of you to be apprehensive . 
let me go now you 'll make me late . 
tomorrow is the full moon . 
but david . 
david you do n't honestly believe that in reality your friend jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you ? do you really ? 
of course . 
it 's nice to see you . 
david perhaps you 'd like to watch the telly while i take a shower . 
the bedroom . 
the kitchen . 
i would think so . 
what do i think ? you mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends ? 
your dead friend jack ? 
you 're to be discharged tomorrow . will you be all right ? 
are you better now ? 
a werewolf ? 
good . i thought for a moment i was the only embarrassed one in the room . 
all i am to you is a sex fantasy then ? 
you 're being awfully forward are n't you ? 
how did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient ? 
now david i said i would keep you company but i meant right here and now . 
david your dreams will stop . you 'll leave england and your bad memories ; and then this will all fade away . 
that 's easy enough . 
do n't be silly . can i get you something ? 
hello . you all right ? 
ahem a word of explanation . it was in warwick castle that i came across the curious stranger whom i am going to talk about . he attracted me by three things : his candid simplicity his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking . we fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd ... 
a connecticut yankee in king arthur 's court by samuel l. clemens . this is after the preface but before chapter one : a word of explanation . you all right ? 
shall i read to you ? 
was jack goodman your good friend ? 
i know . 
twenty - eight . 
that 's not really a very proper question . 
i 'm sorry . i should n't have asked you . 
what do you dream about ? 
i 've just started it . my friend gave it to me . 
' a connecticut yankee in king arthur 's court ' by mark twain . 
i thought you were asleep . 
let 's try a little harder shall we ? 
shall i be forced to feed you david ? 
shall i be forced to feed you mr. kessler ? 
call me alex . 
well you 're to take these after you 've eaten . now what kind of nurse would i be if i failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills ? 
you put me in an awkward position mr. kessler . 
i 'm afraid you have to eat something . 
you have n't eaten your lunch . 
mr. kessler ? 
i beg your pardon ? 
i thought not . 
benjamin have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck ? 
no what ? 
how are we feeling tonight ? 
the doctor will be round later . would you like a picture book to look at ? we have some lovely funny beanos . 
feeling better ? 
well all right then be that way . here swallow this . 
no what ? 
hello benjamin . 
really susan i do n't think that was very proper and besides it 's common practice now . 
why on earth do you say that ? 
chart says he 's from new york . 
yes i should think . he called out just now . 
yes mrs. hobbs . 
has he been refusing food ? 
yes mrs. hobbs . 
yes sir . 
yes sir . 
not yet mr. clark . 
good morning . 
you want the rest of those numbers mr. dickson ? 
yes sir . 
in mr. sampson 's office . 
oh mr. dickson - they 're going to arrest matt . they think he did it ! 
yes sir . 
why the directors are waiting for you in the board room . 
why - well i 
i do n't know . 
good morning . 
all right . 
i 'm afraid so . 
he 's at a board meeting . 
how - do - you - do mrs. dickson . 
matt look ! there 's mr. jones ! 
mr. williams . . . 
did you talk to him ? 
yes . he called some of the biggest people in town . 
something 's happened . he is n't trying anymore . 
oh matt . . . 
shh . . . !   i 'll wait for you upstairs . 
now you 've got me worried dear .   promise me you wo n't butt in . 
oh now do n't be silly . 
say matt you have n't done anything about what you saw today have you ? 
what 's keeping you ? 
in cluett 's office ? 
oh matt you must be mistaken . 
well . . . ? 
what 's the matter matt ? gee i thought you 'd be thrilled to death . 
what happened ? what did he say ? did you get the job ? 
say i just heard the merger is n't going thru . is n't that grand ? 
oh matt . 
the ten dollars . 
what did you do with it ? 
oh is that so ? 
come here honey ! 
matt come here ! 
yes sir . 
he came to see mr. cluett . 
he was in the bank yesterday . 
did you say dude finlay ? 
why matt ! 
i 'm not afraid of you . you have n't got a moustache ! 
what is that mr. bones?[7 ] 
you know there ought to be a congressional medal for men like you . america 's comfort to misunderstood wives . i never thought i would find myself in that class . 
no . no i 'm afraid papa is n't that much interested . he 's too busy rushing off to philadelphia to make stuffy old speeches at stuffy old bankers ' meetings . too busy closing big important deals   i think i will have a drink . 
no . i know the answer to that one .   i think you 'd better take me home . 
i knew i could n't trust you . you told me you were taking me home . 
what 's this ? 
why cyril you 're insane 
now wait a minute wait a minute ... 
why are you so anxious ? 
do n't be silly cyril . these are respectable people . they 'd probably bore you to death . 
you ? no can do . it 's all set . just a few of tom 's closest friends . 
well what ? 
but i 'm giving a party for him - a real old - fashioned surprise party . caps bells whistles and everything . i 'm really terribly excited about it . i 've been planning it for months . 
oh ! oh no !   i think i 've done enough experimenting for one day . congratulations cyril . you 've convinced me that you 're a philanderer of the very first order . i shall recommend you highly . 
see we 're getting along famously ! 
does n't that come next ? 
now let me see what comes next ?   oh yes i know - what are you doing tonight phyllis ? 
come on cyril try a little bit of it out on me . i have n't had any first - class blarney thrown at me since the day i was married . 
whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women . 
not bad not bad at all . do you know something ? i 've always been curious about your line . 
running around . not your work .   you 'd better start reforming cyril ! 
here here here now ! do n't you go back to work on me too . i 'm getting tired of this . besides it 's beginning to affect your looks 
liar ! you 're just suffering from lack of sleep . 
for a celebrated bounder that is an awful admission . besides i never knew that any female could do this to you . 
what is the matter with you ? you 're trembling ? 
this wo n't do . not during business hours . . . 
in cluett 's apartment ? well dear you see i . . . i . . . 
last night ? er - why - uh last night . . . 
all right . i 'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night . 
tomorrow night ? 
well . . . 
ho ho ho yourself ! i would n't laugh if i were you . you may not suspect it but i 'm still attractive - to some . 
the girls !   i do n't suppose it ever occurred to you that i might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . . 
yes of course . 
the theatre ? 
i do n't care whether it 's important or not . you said you were going out with me and if you had n't promised so faithfully i would n't have gone and planned the whole thing . 
now tom you simply can not go to philadelphia tonight . that 's all there is to it . 
nothing . tom i thought you were going out with me tonight . 
it 's amazing that your sweet lovely gorgeous wife can ever get to see you . 
hello darling . 
oh well . i guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite . when he comes out you tell him i 'll be back . he has n't gotten rid of me ! 
well take my word for it and do n't try it . it 's useless !   if it were some other woman i could handle her but after all you ca n't scratch a bank 's eyes out now can you ? 
helen did you ever try competing with a bank ? 
board meeting . oh that means hours i suppose . 
is that busy husband of mine busy ? 
he thinks this is some kind of game ! 
i think he 's already feeling better . 
i fooled them into thinking i was alone . 
he 's going to be fine right daddy ? 
daddy do n't start with this again . 
do n't swear . 
i ca n't believe i had to blow up a train for you . 
you get arrested again i 'll kill you . 
if you do n't see it it 's not real ... 
do n't turn around . 
stop it . this is just sad . 
jesse have you ever noticed that when you 're trying to charm your way out of trouble your accent gets all farm boy ? 
now wait a minute . there are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding . 
are you going to be happy here mr. james ? without all that excitement ? 
i would never have imagined us in a place like this . 
that 's ... wonderful . it 's just ... i thought ... 
i do n't understand . 
jesse . what are you thinking ? there are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county ! 
whose justice ? yours or god 's ?   when will you stop ? 
let the law -- 
you and i we 've started ... something you know ?   i do n't know what 'll happen if you do this . 
i am so sorry jesse . 
were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting ?

sparkling rocks ? 
where will you find such a girl ? 
and what 's this right girl like ? 
you planning on being a bachelor your whole life jesse james ? 
thank god you grew out of that .   you did grow out of that did n't you ? 
a river pirate . 
you did n't want to farm ? 
so you 're saying i should leave you alone and go spend time with jimmy younger ? 
everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued cole . we 're all so proud of you jesse . and not a single farm 's been sold to the railroad since . you 're everybody 's hero . 
i should n't tease a hero . 
teasing you is completely unfair . 
you 're sick of my company ? 
you should n't be up . 
jesse is that your hand ? 
jesse are you awake ? 
but still died . 
you were little jesse james when you left .

uh huh ? 
if you had an american express card she 'd give you a blowjob .   listen this girl worked in a tanning salon need i say more? ... what do you do ? 
anything ? that 's not even credible . if he wants to go up there ? to check it out ? i think you should encourage him .   it 's his life . but everybody 's treating him like this -- valuable object . you 're hurting your own case . 
i can paint anywhere . 
you know what he 's like . he just wants to work on stuff that 's cool . 
you are a fanatic . 
is it over ? 
you 're just afraid to eat it . 
it 's gon na get cold .

you ca n't just walk in either . 
milo you told me those doj agents are all over the place . how could they hope to hide a surveillance post ?   and how can you get in there anyway ? with the cameras and the swipe cards -- 
even if all this were true . there 're 20 other buildings . all of them filled with computers and -- 
you 're scaring me . i think we should just go . 
they hack into people 's programs ? 
i ca n't see outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that . 
are you saying you think they had something to do with his death ? nelson said it was an airtight case . 
it was a hate crime . 
teddy was killed last night . 
i mean if one little comment from gary is gon na upset you this much -- 
what 's extreme is what that er doctor said when he pumped your stomach . eat another sesame seed and that 's it . 
if you ca n't deal with him on that basis you better get a new counselor . 
he 's your boss . he 's not your -- 
what would it mean anyway ? if he did n't write it ? 
that 's what i need to ask you .   you know you ca n't keep anything from me . 
milo ! what about -- ? 
we 're not gon na let it . 
prob'ly waiting by the phone for outpost to call . we 'll leave it for him ? 
do n't bring that up . like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die ? 
no way . you have this -- destiny . 
did n't you visit the campus ? 
i think that 's great milo . i do . 
but he 's not quite the same guy anymore . do n't get your hopes too high ? 
bully ? are we talking about gary boyd ? or your dad . 
it 's important . 
then you 've got ta ask him about that . 
c'm on how often do you talk to somebody who 's been on the cover of time . three of four times . 
i do n't think he knows how . 
he said it made sense that gary 's code was like teddy 's that that cliché about great minds was true . said it was all about his own guilt .   plus he has a tendency to get gary mixed - up with his dad once in a while . it always passes . 
instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl . fire her . or something . 
he 'll tell me when he gets home . 
latitude 47 degrees . 
maybe it 's the satellite . 
but you said the other -- 
it 's three years old it -- 
tell me you 're not calling on your car phone ? ! 
please do n't go . 
why ? ! 
does he know you know ? 
you 'll come up with something . 
you could always say you have to go the bathroom . 
same with the excerpts i 'm choosing : they 'll play against any of the images you described . 
milo ? what if shrot notices somebody entered the day care at four a.m. ? and tells them about it ? 
yeah that 's old in a tree . 
he does n't know about the day care . 
milo ? shrot suspects somebody broke into # 21 . i was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts . 
the dishes are juiced up too . 
what 'd he say ? 
'cause their apartments might be bugged ? 
oh .   i liked you . i was checking you out . 
i thought the worst they would do is fire me . who knew they took termination so literally ? 
and what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 are n't hot yet ? you said the place is n't finished . 
you mean -- break in ? 
before they kill somebody else too . 
it 's a standard gui . once i 've got a concept it 's maybe three day 's work . 
but they 'd still get the idea right ? 
a what ? 
he 's got 12 satellites up . he 's got dishes on top of 21 . he 's building this --   mega - network for skywire . let 's use it . 
how close are you ? 
but still you ca n't say cbs would n't love to break something like -- 
we could cross - reference a data base on media ownership . but not on our own computers . not even at home . 
the mainstream media . tv or a newsmagazine . 
there 're so many disinformation sites about gary already . where he has devil 's horns or they crop him in with saddam hussein . 
who can we trust ? 
what about the fbi ? 
i always felt if a -- boy i liked ever found out -- he 'd run . he 'd think i was unclean . 
... milo ? 
he 's out of prison ? 
is that my -- scenario ?   tell me . 
oh yeah ? 
but why would they -- ? 
the day care ? 
why would you do a thing like -- 
that 's great . i -- did n't know . 
then and now .   but not right now . 
long story . not that interesting . 
mmm - more like -- i have a little trouble . trusting people . 
maybe once . i re - wrote it anyway . 
mine 's not the ceo . he barely remembers to take a shower . 
they just pushed up the schedule on skywire apps . how fast are you going ? 
did you wanna be alone ? 
yeah ? i ran it for lots of platforms ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to -- 
graphical interfaces . for skywire ? i 'm s'posed to coordinate with you . 
no i know what you mean . i used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers . least they make sense . sometimes you think they 've betrayed you . like a person would . but then you see no you just missed a step . you can go back and make it all work . 
... something like that . yeah . 
we moved around so much i barely knew my teachers . 
i would n't worry about it . you 've got ta figure most people around here were their teachers ' pets . 
you 're famous around here . 
you know my name . 
oh you 're very clever . let 's make love you silly hairy little man . 
i 'll tell you all in due time after we make love . but first tell me another poem . 
do you mind if i ask you a personal question ? 
kiss me . 
thank you that 's beautiful . to your health . 
that 's very clever . do you know any other poems ? 
how do you feel mr. cunningham ? 
care for some saki ? 
in japan men come first and women come second . 
may i wash you ? 
do n't you like girls mr. cunningham ? come in and i 'll show you everything you need to know . 
come in . 
it 's for the mining industry mr. cunningham . we can talk about business later . but first let me slip into something more comfortable . 
virtucon 's main interest is in cable television but they do have a subterranean construction division yes . how did you know ? 
you may . 
what do you want mr ... cunningham was it ? 
i thought you 'd quit while you were ahead . 
kiss me . 
i love you austin . 
i have something to tell you . 
i 'll secure the perimeter . 
austin i 'm coming with you . 
are you crazy ? 
i believe you austin . let 's go . 
oh behave ! 
austin what 's your point ? 
i 'll hurry back . 
i 'm not going anywhere . we 're a team . 
what do we do now ? 
shut up . 
no no no . we 'll use the floss to get to the ledge . 
sadly no . hold on ! i always keep this on me just in case . 
not now austin . 
thank god austin we made it . 
austin we do n't look anything like our photo badges . 
i 'm looking at you and the whole time i ca n't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie - kooch . 
you know who . 
do you think she 's prettier than i ? 
i 'll tell him . by the way i 've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional . 
basil was very concerned to know where you were last night . 
thirty years of political and social upheaval . the fall of the berlin wall a female prime minister of england the abolishment of apartheid a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang . 
you just do n't get it do you austin ? good night . welcome to the nineties you 're going to be very lonely . 
well it means something to me . if you want us to have a relationship you 've got to be a one - woman man . 
not in the nineties . 
no did you use a condom ? 
i ca n't believe you made love to her just like that . did you use protection ? 
listen i know i 'm just being neurotic but i ca n't shake this suspicious feeling about that italian secretary ms. fagina . i mean i do n't want to sound paranoid but i 've had some bad relationships in the past and i have some jealousy issues . you went to her penthouse . it makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities but i ca n't help but feel this weird irrational unfocused ... well jealousy . i 'm sorry . 
austin may i have a word with you ? 
really austin ! 
it 's not that i 'm drunk i 'm just beginning to see what my mum was talking about .   what was my mother like back in the sixties ? i 'm dying to know . 
i 'm not . i 'm the sensible one . i 'm always the designated driver . 
i am not . 
always wanting to have fun that 's you in a nutshell . 
i have n't had fun like that since college . 
go ! just go ! 
watch out you 're on my hair ! 
i could n't have another bite . 
i hate having my picture taken . 
unfortunately while you told that stupid story dr. evil has escaped . 
i do n't get it . 
we ca n't just sit here austin . 
let 's go get him ! 
how do you know ? 
a limousine has just pulled up . 
do you want to talk to him ? 
why did you leave so soon ? 
oh i forgot to tell you they 're prescription x - ray glasses . i have very bad astigmatism . 
here use mine . 
i 'm sure . 
no actually . i do n't know how to put this really . well there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry . 
yes we 've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone an on - board computer and a global geosynchronous positioning device . oh and finally this . 
i understand that mr. powers but let me be perfectly clear with you perhaps to the point of being insulting . i will never have sex with you ever .   if you were the last man on earth and i was the last woman on earth and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation i still would not have sex with you . 
i hope this is part of the unfreezing process . 
we do n't use the term ' negro ' anymore . it 's considered offensive . 
a chigro ? 
mr. powers please . i know that you must be a little confused but we have a very serious situation at hand . i would appreciate it if you 'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest . 
i 'm sorry ? 
excuse me ? 
i beg your pardon ? 
i went to oxford and excelled in several subjects but i ended up specializing in foreign languages . i wanted to travel -- see the world . in my last year i was accepted into the m.o.d. in the cultural studies sector . i thought i was off on an exciting career but my job was to read everything printed in every country . it 's very boring . my whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in farsi . if i do well with this case i finally get promoted to field operative ... 
listen mr. powers i look forward to working with you but do me a favor and stop calling me baby . you can address me as agent kensington . we have to leave immediately . we 've preserved your private jet just as you left it . it 's waiting at heathrow airport . 
my mother 's doing quite well thank you very much . 
my mother 's told me all about you . 
mr. powers my job is to acclimate you to the nineties . you know a lot 's changed since 1967 . 
i 'm on with a friend !   look i 'd better go . i love you . 
you did n't answer my question mum . 
did you ever want to ? 
did you ever ... 
i just do n't see it . 
what about his teeth ? 
well god knows he tried but i 've been rather firm with him mummy . you did n't tell me he was so obsessed with sex . it 's bizarre . 
oh god no i made him sleep on the couch . 
he 's asleep . 
would that i could say the same . 
so i 'm still ... 
how long have i been here ? 
... love ... 
... love ... 
... love ... 
... preserve ... 
... power ... 
... death ... 
... death ... 
... head ... 
... bottle ... 
sir august ... ?   what now ? 
promised ? who promised ? 
have we met ? 
i so agree . how did you acquire a taste for it ? 
i 've come to apply for membership in brolly -- 
really -- what happened in 1922 ? 
i have an appointment . 
as you see . 
mr. john steed please . 
then who wins ? 
rules are made to be broken . 
this is n't a game . 
your voice -- it 's so familiar ... 
quite a collection . 
sir august ... ? sir august ... ? 
thank you steed . 
next assignment ? 
so am i. 
to find out who killed my husband . 
the institute ... the funding ... 
to you ... ? 
i thought i was a widow . my husband ... the only man i ever loved ... is dead . for the rest of my life i have to live with that . 
what are you trying to do to me ? 
watch me . 
i resign . 
after the cold war ... 
directed by laser . bounced by satellite . quite possible . 
he tried to warn us ... 
how curious ... 
let me guess -- ' father ' ? 
i 'll never marry you . 
what are my choices ? 
how wagnerian ... do you mean to say you 've waited all these years because you could n't create a chip on your own ? that would have amused peter . 
then what 's stopping you ? 
the result would be ... 
such as ? 
you 're mad . 
valentine listen to me ... 
i 'm already married ... 
' our revels now are ended . ' 
but -- why ? 
but i found you . all the clues led me here ... 
too many cooks -- 
you killed my husband . 
dr. darling peter ... all you ... 
thanks valentine ... 
ah ... sun tan lotion . any shops nearby ? 
pity your mother came too ... 
our little paradise -- just made for two ? 
i do n't recall siberia being this warm steed . 
have you any place in mind ? 
still a bit chilly ... 
' ... in a beautiful pea green boat ... ' 
what kept you ? 
if you 'd been through what i have you would n't -- 
you need n't bother . i ca n't drag you further into this . after all i am still the chief suspect . 
where are you going ? 
have a look at this . 
' the merry widow ? ' i might have known . where 's the reception ? 
trubshaw again ? what now ? 
shall we ? 
when all this is over we simply must get you out of that suit . 
what is it ? 
it 's called black leather . 
have we been invited ? 
hurry ?   what for ?   i 'm just now -- 
are n't you coming ? 
why 's he called ' invisible ' ? 
i 'm a wanted woman i know ... 
not to speak of . peter and i were both loners . there was nobody . 
... or grown - ups who still like to be children . 
no idea who . no idea why ... 
you lied . 
as far as you trust me . 
no after you . 
please do n't tell me it 's how you play the game . 
i 'm playing to win . 
i thought you played by the rules . 
you 're playing games . 
but you did suspect me . 
is that all ? 
mmm ... what are you doing ? 
it was n't me ; you have my word . 
and do you trust me ? 
yes ... ? 
because you always obey orders ... 
i could save you the trouble . 
to kill me ? 
you followed me . 
it was peter -- i saw him ... 
was i ? 
where am i ? 
steed ... ! 
someone did n't want us to get to the party . 
this must be the last straw . 
have i trespassed on a male prerogative ?   we 're being followed . i saw him at trubshaw 's ... 
is that what you think ? 
not that i know of .   explanation ? 
then a mad millionaire . head of a secret defense establishment . a group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ... 
three agents killed by bad weather ... 
that 's what we were working on . 
exactly . there 'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea . propane gas mostly . in small quantities it captures chlorine . protects the ozone layer . but it proved impractical . too bulky ... 
the prospero project was started by my husband . it was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming . in theory climate engineering is entirely feasible . we thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite . a ' quick fix ' ... 
not quite . this is my field . 
thanks ...   i see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... hello ? 
she had this in her mouth . there there ... 
is that written in his shoe ? 
any ideas ? 
very good steed ... 
how on earth can you tell ? 
i should have thought that was obvious ...   i 'm in mourning . 
you mean my other self ... 
did you say formal ? i must dress . 
no . but he must know . incidentally my double left you with this . 
that 's possible . sir august was convinced he 'd met me before . but i 'd never met him . another odd thing . when it rained he said it was just as someone had promised . 
but that 's absurd . i may not be over - fond of you steed but it 's not my style . 
you told them . you said i arrived on a camel shot you four times . left you for dead . 
mother and dr. darling have me under observation . they think i tried to kill you . 
i mean your man trubshaw .   your bullet - proof waistcoat .   i thought you were just overdressed . 
you were very lucky .   four shots to the heart . i found you after i slipped away from sir august . mother brought you here . not me you should thank . 
you should be dead .   how do you feel ? 
so ... i distract him while you snoop around ? how ? 
any other vices ? 
june july ... august ? 
an eccentric recluse ? 
no thanks . 
i have no choice . why should you risk your life ? 
just what is your position if you do n't mind my asking .   how did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work ? 
do we always follow mother 's instructions ? 
sir august merryweather ... why are we seeing him first ? 
that 's predictable . when i find a queen in need of protection i 'll let you know . 
and i suppose you 're the knight . 
but why ? what 's the point ? 
you know what i mean . this car -- and you . nobody walks around like that . milk ? 
that place is so absurd so out of date ... 
you can but i wish you would n't ... 
steed we really must be -- 
or half cocked . 
i thought we were on our way . 
do you ? 
i had a feeling you would . touche ! 
my father always wanted a boy . 
a kipper . or a red herring ? what were they investigating ? 
we 're not here to talk about the weather surely . 
and now that we 've settled the matter of honorifics will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you ? 
under the circumstances you may call me mrs. peel . 
and just what is the game ? 
rules are made to be broken . 
whereas you are . 
so what was all this -- some sort of test ? 
1922 . why the kippers ? 
i had a spot of bother at the door . 
and you must be steed . please do n't get up . 
decontamination -- ? 
you do n't believe him ? 
where 's mother ? 
you 're saying i have no choice . 
i 'm no spy -- where do i fit in ? 
i 'm going to find out who killed my husband . will you take these documents to steed ? 
i shall need a small plane . 
let me guess :   wonderland weather . 
... and now ? 
well i ca n't possibly go like this . 
i fail to see -- 
getting to what ? 
are you suggesting that dr. darling and valentine were somehow in this together ? but that 's absurd . 
who 's now vanished . 
surveillance ? by whom ? 
i know all this . 
peter 's brother ?   but -- 
i see . 
speaking of peter there 's more good news : you wo n't even have to change your last name . you 'll always be mrs. peel . 
the missing piece of the jigsaw . i tried to get you to give it to me as peter ; i tried to steal it from you as dr. darling . as myself i 'll be a bit less subtle .   with this ring my plan will be complete . 
one very small thing . a diamond ' cyclone ' chip . a thousand times more information on a fraction of the size . if i possess that my powers would be unlimited . my dear half - brother was developing it . but he suspected sabotage . he gave the chip to ... you ' mrs. ' peel . i want you . but also your ring . 
chaos . transport paralysis . crop failure .   economic disaster . frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale . you 've seen a few samples ... 
destruction of their local weather systems . i can zap a thousand chernobyls into the air . 
entirely . on the other hand   mad people get things done . let me show you -- 
that 's better . i say is n't this where you came in ? it 's impenetrable by the way ... 
right bridesmaid . now what have i left out ? oh yes i know : the ring . 
you know i believe she 's actually jealous . 
come come you 're a widow -- a most attractive widow . now i think of it we 'll need a bridesmaid . here . 
think of this as your second wedding feast ... 
oh no emma . they 've only just begun ... 
you disappoint me emma .   ca n't you guess ?   for you . it was all for you ... 
of course . i planned that too . 
spoil the majority shareholders . in wonderland weather . i planned everything even the ministry recruiting you ... 
for starters . of course i had to kill the teddy bears as well ... 
an unholy trinity ... 
a slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition . fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ... 
darling emma -- yes we :   the true genius behind the prospero project ... 
good luck ... peter ... emma . 
come come . you do n't really expect me to fall for -- 
are n't you forgetting about something ? 
you said ... one shot . 
if you say so . 
that 's not playing by the rules . 
you wish . 
but did they teach you this ? 
you 're better than i expected . 
the last one you 'll ever see . 
john steed . 
right in here . the big show starts in one minute . 
i feel like i 'm spying on rick . 
you 're kidding . 
what do you mean ? 
what do you think 's gon na go on at the guys ' party ? 
no . as far as they 're concerned the only good rick is a dead rick . but i do n't care ... it 's my decision . 
he still thinks i 'm going with him . i 'm going to break the news to him tomorrow . 
bobbie what are you talking about ? 
i 'm going now cole . 
cole i 'm sorry i ... 
i 'm not . i just thought i should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else . 
cole i 'm marrying rick . 
cole listen to me ... i 've got to tell you ... 
no cole i ... 
cole we 've got to talk . 
you 're so romantic ... 
let 's get naked . 
i do n't believe you . 
and i want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment . 
the marriage is off . now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life . 
let go of me ! 
rick you 're lying ! 
i ca n't trust you ! 
why do n't you get undressed . 
do n't turn on the lights sugar .   i 'll lead you around . 
i love you . 
have a good time . do n't make it too late . 
your mother 's not dead . 
you 're really pissing me off . 
remember you promised ... no screwing around . 
ca n't i just go with you guys ? 
gon na get married ... 
you better not have too much joy . 
um ... that 's very relaxing . 
that feels so great . 
before or after i have my nervous breakfown ? 
the wedding my parents your family our friends my job the future our relationship the caterers my gown your tuxedo our honeymoon the apartment my shower your bachelor party ... 
i do n't know ... i just feel scared . 
stop fooling around ... i need to talk . 
i ca n't sleep . 
because from what i 've heard it 's a tradition and you 're a traditional guy . 
i 'm not talking about does . i 'm talking about hookers . 
are you going to have women at your party ? 
it looks awful . 
you 're going to have a bachelor party ? 
want to hear something great ? bobbie and phoebe are throwing me a shower . it 's really gon na be fun . 
i think your dinner 's burning . 
what are we having ? 
god you 're a slob . 
ilene are you crazy ? 
let 's go . 
that does n't mean it was rick 's party . 
are you sure this is a good idea ? 
ilene rick promised ... 
ilene why would i want to do that ? i trust rick . 
i hope those guys are all right . 
quiet mother . 
ilene we do n't really know that . 
why is cole here ? 
great mom . 
it 's a small town . 
i do n't have the slightest idea ... 
i quit two days ago brian . 
that 's a dumb thing to say . 
just take it . 
y'know four years ago i was working in a bakery . two years ago i was bringing marty coffee and he did n't even know my name . i run that office now . marty believed in me and i believe in him . you want me to just throw that away ? 
do you know what you 're asking me to do ? 
i do n't know anything about it . 
we still talking ?   look i 'm sorry about the other day -- 
you knew what we were asking you to do . do n't suddenly pull out a conscience now . the fit is n't right . 
oh yeah he 's the real fireman .   who are you ? just another probie working for swayzak -- 
let me ask you something do you really think marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills ? who the hell are you kidding ? i was there remember ? i saw you and your brother -- 
i was doing my job . 
will you please keep your voice down there 's people -- 
i did n't know it was a secret . there are n't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators -- 
brian . what 's wrong ? 
uh huh . 
then why did you quit ? 
do you miss it ?   you seem like you do . 
got anything to drink in there ? 
but rimgale 's probably going to come around to arson . 
yeah but it does n't take albert einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not . 
boy rimgale 's as slow as a snail is n't he ? 
marty did .   but i wanted you to come to . 
you think that 's really any of your business ? 
if you were n't at least the 300th person to ask me that i 'd probably be pissed .   boy you sure know it 's a man 's world sometimes ... 
i could use a date . 
green committed to a thousand .   there 's another fund - raising party tonight . marty'd really like you to come . 
how 's it going ? 
straightest answer your department 's given me all week . 
... okay . i 'll arrange things with your assignment captain .   marty 's a good man brian . 
look i did n't mean to take a piece out of you back there i just thought you 'd call when you came back . you did n't and ...   do n't blow it just because of this garbage between us . 
brian do you always have to be so stupid ? think about your future for once . 
boy took you all of thirty seconds to blow that . 
yeah well i like to think i 'm just a little past hanging out on jp ii watching the irish pick fights and litwalks barf in the planters . 
bullshit . marty 's plan is only about efficiency . i 've got two cousins on the job you think i 'd work for him if i did n't believe in it ? 
why do you think marty came here tonight ? because he cares about your department . you do n't know how hard he works . you do n't know about his programs helping west side -- 
let me tell you something . martin swayzak is going to be this town 's next mayor . 
look i 'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a saturday night . this is n't about fun . i 'm working here . 
when i was twenty . 
i do n't want to be your friend brian . 
what you think i just dried up and blew away when you left ? the world does turn once in awhile brian even without your permission . 
i work for city hall . 
not quite . just visiting . i live in lincoln park now . 
thanks for calling . 
you 're back . 
you guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile . 
stephen 's not staying here now brian . he moved out last april . 
stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident . 
yeah you 'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid . 
four months ? 
' bout written you off . how long have you been in town ? 
you look like ... brian . 
i do n't want to confuse him stephen . 
-- no that 's okay . it 's just sean ... 
stephen ... i ... can i talk to you a second ... 
what 's wrong ? 
you ca n't keep being his father ... 
yeah ? when was the last time ? 
ah stephen that 's what this is really about is n't it ? you always have to be right . 
i know he 's out but how 's he doing ? 
what 's wrong stephen ?   c'm on you only beat up the roof when something 's on your mind .   how 's brian doing ? 
you want some coffee ? 
you treated me like shit . 
he deserved it . he was born deserving it . 
the great communicator . 
-- you remember . 
stephen you got ta stop just showing up on the roof like this . 
he 's going to be a fireman . 
he 's got piano lessons . 
it 's not your roof anymore . 
stephen what are you doing here ? 
here we go ... 
stephen i 'm kinda busy here can we talk about this later ? 
how come all those guys who 're looking to get 50 from the church have n't come up with shit ? you got some kinda inside track ? 
but you could do it baby . we could use the bread ... 
sure it is . you 're a virgin . just like that nun . and i 'm gon na rape you . 
first i 'll put your uptown in the spoon then to make it more exciting i 'm gon na add some downtown . they call this thing a speedball honey but then you must know that ...   first time shooting up ? 
then c'mere . i got something for you . 
c'mere . you got some good blow right ? 
ok . ok . fine . but -- do you believe in god ?

you do n't have the demographics . 
what makes you think he would write a show about the mau - mau 's . 
who are you revolting against ? 
hook you up ?   the mau - mau 's ?   you must be smoking .   why in the world would i want to hook up a bunch of red black and green flag - waving pseudo revolutionairies ? 
i order out mostly .   so what do i owe this visit to ? 
i 'm not callin you big black africa . mommy and daddy named you julius .

dela kiss my big black ass . 
work related or otherwise ? 
that was a mistake but i do n't regret it . 
that 's why it will be so much fun . 
that which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light .   this bucket of blood . 
dela you should try it sometime . come into the light . 
i ca n't lie to him .   if he asks me something i tell him what i think . 
please do n't go there . 
he 's just playing big brother . 
you 're the one that put us together . we 're friends . 
i do n't want to hear it . 
to me it shows part of our history in this country a time when we were considered inferior sub - human . 
it 's all good .   you got a hit show you 're gon na need a bank .   plus i love these old black collectibles . 
i thought it was appropiate . 
this is authentic not a repro circa turn of the century . 
no matter what you think you did come up with something unique . open it . 
a gift . 
so you have your small victory now what ? 
everybody shut up . 
i 'm sorry i ca n't help it .   it 's too funny . 
i want to apologize about my brother and the mau - mau 's .   i should not have imposed them on you . 
the pleasure is mine . 
just do n't lie to me . 
we both lied to him . 
let 's leave the man in peace so he can get ready . 
break a leg . 
you 've said that already . 
the big one . 
this is the group i was telling you about . 
like i said all this for some twisted distorted sense of principal .   dunwitty he just tolerates your negroidal ass he does n't respect it . 
what 's the chances of mantan being picked up ? 
fuck da money .   why do through all this effort ?   why ?   are you looking for love from dunwitty ?   for respect ?   dunwitty and his likes do n't give a goddamn about you .   so now what are you gon na do ? 
why did you even come up with that shit if you did n't want it made ? 
what is your problem ? 
you okay ? 
maybe something happened to them . maybe they 're lying in an alley bleed to death . 
ca n't you just quit ?   walk away ? 
i 'm in till the end . 
sounds risky to me . 
what point is that ? 
you lost me . 
do you know how you will use him ? 
the idea was out there in the universe .   now what ? 
it hit me like a ton of bricks . 
it was n't my fault .   if i would have known i would have known . 
nobody told me anything . 
how was it ? 
i envy you .   that 's the way i want to feel about my work . 
why do you say that ?   you 've never seen me . 
if that was suppose to be a compliment i thank you . 
no we 're not knocking boots .   i got this internship while i still was at nyu dela was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant . 
what do you mean ? 
a little .   i just graduated from nyu film school .   cinema studies . 
i wish i had your natural talent . god only makes that visit once in a while . 
you 've never had any formal training either ? 
you can go now . 
why do n't you answer ? 
forget about me are you a puppet for dela ? 
that 's ancient history .   that has nothing to do with you and i. 
we did it one time only once .   it had nothing to do with the job it was stupid .   everything i 've got i 've earned . 
say what manray ? 
just ask me what you want to know . 
and what ? 
after my internship expired dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant . 
worked my black ass off first as an intern then worked my way up to this position . 
i 'll be down front .   you better start putting your face on . 
you 're sure this is a good idea . 
why do n't you call him ? 
i just do n't want you and cheeba to get hurt . 
bert williams and the rest they had to black up .   they had no choice .   they were considered 3/5ths of a human being .   did you know that 's written in the constitution of the united states ? 
maybe you need to start . 
you do n't read do you ? 
y'know at the beginnin ' of the century african - american had to perform in blackface .   you ever heard of bert williams ?   he was a great artist . 
i hope you save a little somethin' somethin' . 
oh you do huh ? 
this is a nice place .   it must have cost a pretty penny . 
are you trying to rap to me ? 
i 'm an asthmatic .   been one all my life .   ca n't go anywhere without an inhaler . 
what do you want to know ? 
people show their happiness in a lot of different ways . 
i wo n't forget .   when are you coming up here to see your mother ? 
you know how your daddy is . 
of course i 'm happy for you . you 've worked very hard for your success . 
i 'm doing okay .   been reading about your show it 's all over everywhere . i watched it 's all over everywhere . i watched it once .   i thought you said there would be no buffoonery . 
peerless last time go see your father . 
even more reason to see him .   he 'll be overjoyed with your success . 
regardless he still is your father . 
richmond is not all the way down south . 
he 's performing at some place outside of richmond virginia . 
yes he did . 
he wants you to come and see him . 
peerless your father called . 
i will .   and good luck with your show .   i hope it 's a huge success . you 've worked very hard .   you deserve it . 
peerless i did n't raise a buffoon . we have enough of those on television already . 
i guess he 's still on the road . what kind of show is this ?   are they some negroes in it without being buffoons ? 
son peerless is your name .   now you might be one of these hollywood types change your name and all that but peerless dothan is on your birth certificate . 
if at first it 's not what you want just work that much harder peerless . 
that 's wonderful .   is n't that what you always wanted a show of your own ? 
how 's the food ? 
i said no such thing .   all i said is that something must be wrong . 
you hear me talkin ' to you .   the only time you come up here when something is wrong . 
you must think i 'm some kind of fool . 
old fool ! 
roderick you know well enough that i have never loved but you !   was i ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy ? ever so angry but the least offer of good - will on your part did not bring me to your side ?   did i not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of england upon you ?   have i repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it ? no i loved you too much and too fondly ; i have always loved you . from the first moment i saw you i saw your bad qualities and trembled at your violence ; but i could not help loving you .   i married you though i knew i was sealing my own fate in doing so and in spite of reason and duty .   what sacrifice do you want from me ?   i am ready to make any so you will but love me or if not that at least you will gently us me . 
as soon as i saw you loved me i was pleased and i gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me being certain that for my part i would never love you .   but after our first kiss i found that i had no power over myself .   i did not know that one kiss could matter so much . 
without you my dearest i might have died without ever knowing love . inexpressible love !   god of nature ! bitterness than which nothing is sweeter sweetness than which nothing is more bitter .   divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes . 
shall i tell you something -- i believed what was called love came after the union -- and i was surprised when my husband making me a woman made me know it only by pain unaccompanied by any pleasure . i saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead .   and so we became only friends seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other yet on good terms for a while as whenever he wanted me i was at his service but since the offering was not seasoned with love he found it tasteless and seldom demanded it . 
my husband has convinced me of the contrary . 
our abstinence makes our love immortal .   if i loved you a quarter of an hour ago now i should love you even more .   but i should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires . 
always my dear one never any further .   love is a child to be pacified with trifles .   a full diet can only kill it . 
poor man .   and for that reason you want to begin where people end ? 
you will do as you please .   it seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other .   do you not agree ? 
and if she does not choose to show you some kindness ? 
be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are ? 
but you deceive me nonetheless if i believe you for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer . 
the amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing if it is true that you love me . 
to make me wretched in two weeks . 
you want my heart ? 
how so ? 
a man may need to do that and find it amusing ; but a girl is bound by other laws . 
it is only too possible .   love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult and it is even more difficult to make it last . 
but if when i love i am unhappy i will know that my empty heart was my good fortune . 
many worthy of attention ; but valuing is something more .   i could value only someone whom i loved . 
that man has perhaps not yet been born . 
not one . 
not even that . 
how do you know that ? 
we can prove that you 're not ray dunbar . impersonating a fellow cadet is a court - martial in and of itself -- 
you kept kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end . you even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him too . 
where 's the cabin ? 
why did n't you tell us all this in the first place ? 
mueller was alone in the cabin ? 
back up . 
what about the phosphorous grenade ? 
what business ? 
he said he worked there -- 
tell us about the other guys the ones west weeded out . 
are you saying sergeant west tried to kill you ? 
he was your friend . 
your phone number ? 
a word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss ? probably not the best time to hit on them . 
go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened . 
what are you doing out here ? 
yeah . i can wait till you 're off the base and do it myself . 
nobody saw . but i do n't think so . 
far as i 'm concerned whatever you did in the past can stay in the past . 
you 're a good man hardy . 
that 's not true . 
what if i do n't want it ? 
this is n't the time -- 
we need to talk -- 
no bodies no west ... 
hardy for chrissakes -- 
hardy what are you doing -- 
we got maybe three minutes till they break it down . 
we were close to something with kendall . 
for what ? 
you know you never told me why you left the army . 
think it 'll work ? 
so what now ? 
so did i. 
you wanted to break him . 
you mean the falsely accused ? 
you wanted to get the truth . 
you could n't have known -- 
see i just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls ; then i call every newspaper in the country with the story about how senator kendall 's gay son went nuts on a training mission -- 
good idea . 
positive . hardy they planned this . 
they got their stories straight . 
little bit . 
so why after dunbar drags kendall out from under a house does the senator 's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber ? 
buttfucks the cabin ? 
so it 's a good plan but it goes wrong ; mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy which means they have to bring dunbar and kendall into the cover story -- 
they believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent . 
talk it through : childs mueller and nunez know they 're going out on the regular tuesday night drill hurricane or no hurricane so they plan it : kill west pin it on pike . 
at least you and kendall agree on that . 
because it 's my job . because people are dead . because of the whole honor and duty thing make a difference in the world crap like that .   we can do this hardy . 
but you will . 
i was starting to believe you you know ? that you were n't who everyone said . i guess i was wrong -- 
you did more than try . you cracked dunbar in less than three minutes as an investigator you 're phenomenal -- 
you said you owed styles and now you 're gon na turn your back on him ? 
goddammit hardy you ca n't just leave -- 
styles could n't reassign him he 's a legend -- 
i do n't know . 
look all we 've got is what kendall says and he did n't actually witness any deaths except nunez . he found west he saw mueller and pike but just their bodies -- he did n't see any crime committed . 
i just ... he came back for kendall . i do n't think he 's capable of murder . 
i do n't think that has anything to do with -- 
but we have to question him --   thought you did n't have cigarettes -- 
that was kid gloves ? 
remember he 's the son of a senator so go easy . kid gloves . 
not the happiest of memories ? 
something wrong ? 
what point ? 
imagine what it must have been like for them out there . what do you think of dunbar ? 
you 're off to a late start . 
you do understand that there 's absolutely no way i could ever be attracted to you right ? 
this is the straight hitting on me you were talking about is n't it ? 
you 're kidding . 
something like that . you ? 
typical army brat story . dad was noncom mom was a nurse . there was never any real doubt of joining up . 
what is that ? 
we 're in the middle of a murder case -- 
you really want to make banal chit- chat like that now ? 
you made me look like an idiot -- 
the colonel saw you shoot nunez you 're a murderer -- 
i questioned him for three hours and he did n't make a sound . you do n't have a badge he wo n't talk to you . 
good cop / bad cop ? 
that is the most unprofessional -- 
excuse me ? 
kendall junior is still in surgery so he wo n't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we 're talking to first is dunbar . 
senator jonathan kendall of ohio . 
hurricane knocked out our mainframe so all we have are their dogtags . cadets raymond dunbar and levi kendall -- 
wording and your friendship with the colonel aside i 'm not comfortable having you involved in this . 
you 're the tom hardy i 've been reading about in the papers right ? new orleans pd fired you for taking bribes from guissepe torres . 
you and the colonel go back . 
sergeant west 's served for twenty- three years . he 's the public face of the modern army . 
you knew sergeant west ? 
hostile and uncooperative . 
what happened with nunez ? 
so you framed him . the same way childs was going to frame pike . 
who levi -- 
wrong answer -- 
enjoy your flight to washington -- 
it will and you know why ? because you 're not a person anymore you 're a cadet in the united states army ; you have no identity no miranda warning and no rights . so i 'm gon na throw you to the wolves and unlike you i 'm gon na get away with it because you 're pissing me off ! 
it does n't matter levi . we 're going to find those bodies and when we do i 'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon -- 
you and dunbar got your stories straight . little details little inconsistencies designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other asking questions killing time until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where senator daddy can protect you . you think you 're just going to slide out of this ? you 're an accessory to murder levi you 're going to jail -- 
dunbar says you were . 
pike never confessed . 
fifty minutes . 
pike never confessed . 
but you did n't see it right ? 
nunez was chasing dunbar . 
no one else heard it ? 
he said what ? 
he could n't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own . 
we just want -- 
no no that was cadet dunbar -- 
you never told me why you got kicked out of ... 
what happens to dunbar now ? 
we know . 
he tried to burn dunbar to us . you do n't do that if you 're not involved . 
it 's too neat . 
search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup . if they 're hurt and we can get to them in time ... 
he 's not army it 's not official -- 
but this guy you called he 's not even army -- 
this is totally unnecessary -- 
lucky girl . 
i know . 
please . go . just go . 
it 's okay just leave it . 
i wo n't be selling you this house mr. bloom . 
i was 18 . he was 28 . turns out that was a big difference . 
i 'm not convinced you should be happy . 
then i do n't think so mr. bloom . if nothing is going to change i 'd just as soon it not change in the way it has n't been changing all this time . 
so i 've heard . 
no one would come out here unless they had business . and no one would have business with me except for you . you 're buying the town . 
you must be edward bloom . 
promise me you 'll come back . 
how are you gon na make it without your shoes ? 
and when i 'm 38 you 'll be 48 . and that 's not much difference at all . 
i 'm eight . that means when i 'm eighteen you 'll be 28 . and when i 'm 28 you 'll only be 38 . 
how old are you ? 
it 's not a woman it 's a fish . no one ever catches her . 
was she nekkid ? 
what did she look like ? 
well therapy . and one day i realized i was in love with a man who could never love me back . i was living in a fairy tale . 
no it 's logical if you think like your father . see to him there 's only two women : your mother and everyone else . 
look i do n't know how much you want to know about any of this . you have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it . especially this late in the game . 
can i ask you a question ? why did you come here today ? if you found this deed why did n't you just ask eddie ? 
wow . wow you just said it . i was expecting to dance around this for another half hour . 
this was on his sales route so he was through here all the time . everyone in town knew him . 
i am . and you 're will . i 've seen your picture that 's how i recognize you . i almost said something at the store but it would have been awkward .   like this . 
i was n't expecting you . 
oh . oh . 
i like your stories . 
you were talking about your wedding . 
is it the medicine that 's making you thirsty ? 
i thought you said you did n't have a church wedding . 
oh so this is a tall tale ? 
i never knew . 
can i take your picture ? 
no i understand . 
that 's terrible . 
what were you dreaming about ? 
hi . how are you feeling ? 
i do . 
i 'm sorry . it seems every hour i have to ... 
i need to lie down for a bit . 
i 'll help you . 
i spent a week in morocco for the story . it was incredible . 
your father had a stroke . he 's upstairs with your mom and dr. bennett . 
i am always on your side . and i think you should talk to him . 
you 're not . 
but it 's not true . 
do you love him ? 
do you love your father ? 
mmm what ? 
but it 's romantic . 
what about the details ? how they fell in love . the circus . the war . you never told me any of that . 
you never told me how your parents met . 
i talked with your father last night . 
i 'm going with you . 
i 'm going with you . 
you need to go . 
it 's bad . 
i see . we need to get you one of those plant misters . we can spray you like a fern . 
how can i convince you to stop ? 
you do n't even know me . 
how did you get so many ? 
but you 're wrong . i do know you at least by reputation . edward bloom from ashton . see i 'm actually engaged to a boy from ashton . don price . he was a few years older than you . 
i 'm sorry . 
i loved it . it sounds peculiar but i loved every minute of it . i did . eddie was travelling a lot so he was gone but i felt like i always had a piece of him with me . a little part of his soul inside me . i could feel it . it was alive and kicking . 
do you like it being pregnant ? 
i know . it was the same when i was carrying will . like clockwork . 
i 'm going to check on him . 
i 'm going to get started on dishes . 
we 'll have to pick up a copy . 
down the hall on the right . the door sticks . you have to really pull it . 
thank you . i 'll bet you need to -- 
yes . thank you . 
that 's okay ? 
i do n't suppose one of us could stay with him . in case he ...   in case he wakes up one of us should be there . 
heavens no . we had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place . 
i suppose your grandmother 's house when she passed on . but we sold that right away . your cousin shirley bought it . 
he just fell asleep . josephine 's with him . 
not everything your father says is a complete fabrication . 
do you know who that is ? 
was she one of your teachers ? 
before i forget your father has papers in the basement i 'd like you to go through . i would n't know what 's important . 
well clearly you do n't . but i 'm not the mystery you 're trying to solve right now . 
i know it 's not easy . just remember he did n't choose to be your father and you did n't choose to be his son . you just ended up together . you could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it 'd be just the same . if you ask me it 's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all . 
yes you both think william bloom is a very smart man .   the problem is you only see me as your mother and not as someone 's wife . and i 've been his wife longer than i 've been your mother . you ca n't discount that . 
no it 's not . it 's exactly the same . your father and i met we dated and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level . just the same as you two . 
would you say you understand josephine ? 
yes will i do . and do n't presume things you do n't know . 
of course . 
really ! that 's wonderful . 
you do n't talk about those things . not yet . 
he 's impossible . he wo n't eat . and because he wo n't eat he gets weaker . and because he 's weaker he does n't want to eat . 
he 's up with your father . 
you did n't need to do that . you just did n't . 
ruth mchibbon offered to pick you up at the airport . 
how did you get here ? 
no i have n't . 
leave him ! 
what are you doing here ? 
name it . 
you heard what i said . i 'm pregnant . i 've been throwing up for weeks . 
say thank you . 
do you like it ? 
it is . i did it cooking . 
it 's nothing . i burnt myself . 
you know what i mean babe it 's enough . we can stop . 
it 's enough is n't it ? 
sixty four thousand eight hundred . 
my name 's sophia . 
hurry . i 'll wait for you here . 
maybe you will find out . 
tell me about it . 
it 's more like a date . 
i 'm not asking you to marry me . 
it 's what you came back for . 
it 's not mine . 
i 'm sorry . 
you did n't deserve me john buckingham . 
i 'm quitting . this will be my last one . so . goodbye . 
something else . 
please . why not ? 
okay . thank you . 
i 've got an hour . can i buy you a coffee ? 
you know you can come under the blanket . 
what was her name ? 
except for small eyes . 
maybe i want to die . do n't you want me to die ? 
i smoke more these days . i smoke more when i 'm unhappy . 
i 'm trying to quit . 
she 's alive ! ! she is not dead ? 
she 's alive ? 
i 'm sorry . 
did she leave you ? come on . it 's nothing to be ashamed of . who did she leave you for ? your best friend ? her boss ? a woman ? did she leave you for a woman john ? 
the thin ... the girl with small eyes . the one in your cupboard . 
what happened between you and the blonde ? 
not really . maybe a little . 
i do n't have nothing . 
you are pretty naive if you think it is . 
the rest of the world john it 's not all like st. albans . 
fifteen . you do n't know him . he was very kind and strong . 
i was n't saying anything . 
what ? i ... i was n't saying ... 
you know in russia there 's no work for women . it 's a different world . 
you are throwing me out . 
excuse me ? 
you do n't understand you either . 
so what did you want ? i think we understand each other no ? 
you did n't mind too much . 
oh . i think you will recover okay . i think you got what you paid for . 
so now you hate all women ? 
there 's nothing wrong in liking sex john . 
sometimes neither . 
what 's a moral orgasm john ? tell me how it feels exactly . 
and who says what is wrong . 
and ? what are you saying ? 
i do n't hate you . 
we 'll pretend it never happened . 
okay we wo n't talk about it . 
you do n't want to talk about it . 
why not ? 
no . but you tend to tie them up . 
he left me my passport and ticket . it 's pretty clear he wants to see me again . 
he will come back . 
but you know so what ? 
if what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you then yes he does . 
look if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is . 
it 's none of your business . 
i do n't want to talk about him . 
i said i do n't have any . 
i do n't have any money . 
you do n't have to do this . i can look after myself . 
i 'm going ... i am ... i 'm going to be sick . 
i 'm going to be sick . where 's the ... 
where 's the restroom ? 
you ca n't hurt me more than i 'm hurt already . 
so you 're just going to be vindictive 
i know you just want to punish me -- 
no i do n't . 
why else would you send off for me ? if you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute . 
they do n't blame you . when a bank employee does this they understand . you get your life back . anyway i bet you hated that bank . 
so what are you going to do ? 
it makes it faster . if i do n't speak to the men they fall faster . it 's pretty obvious why . 
it 's makes it easier . okay . 
you do n't understand anything . 
they go . 
they go . 
they go . john . they go . 
happy bath day . 
today is bath day . 
then start taking them seriously .

i begged him not to go . and he did . 
ca n't be thinkin ' bout him every second of my day . i 'll go outta my gourd . 
it 's so stupid . says to me that he do n't want nothin' to do with no military career . says he wants to move . open up an auto shop with his uncle up in knoxville . i said okay . how about now ? let 's go . 
i do n't want you to let go . 
i 've had nice things before but i always ruined 'em somehow .

oh laz ... he hurt me . he ... hurt me so many times . 
he told me ... get help . i just stood there and watched him ... i watched him die laz . oh god ! goddammit ! 
i seen a man die . he could n't breathe ... his heart was ... was givin ' out .

it starts like this ... fire ... that spreads . starts in my head . then moves to my stomach . then it goes lower . i can stop it sometimes but mostly i just jump on and ride it out ... then everything'll go back to normal you know . only thing ever took that feeling away was ... was ... when i met ronnie .   cuz i love him so much . he 's all i got in my life that 's special . and i like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous . when i can do that for him ... it 's like i 'm givin ' somethin' of myself that i have n't givin ' nobody else . 
you ca n't hurt people ... and then just say i 'm sorry and then everything just gets washed away . why would heaven want people like that . people who ... do what they want and then ... switch . 
but that 's so fuckin ' stupid .   i 'm sorry . did n't mean to curse . 
can i ask you a question ?   people always say you got ta get good with jesus if you want not to go to hell . that you say sorry for all you done and ... and jesus would let you go on to heaven . 
you a preacher ? 
you know how like they say you save someone 's life you responsible for them . guess he just do n't think it 's safe for me .

i think if i just piss ... i 'll be okay . 
you do n't got ta get up but ... i got ta go ... 
it 's stupid ... it 's so fucking stupid ! 
i do n't see why we got ta lie 'bout it when you and i know this ai n't gon na work . 
this ai n't gon na work . 
but ... momma ... just tell me ... not gon na be mad ... we can just talk about it ... be eye to eye on this ... you do n't even got to say you 're sorry ... just say how you knew ... 
i 'm sorry ... i did n't mean to shout ... 
now see ? do n't do that . i 'll go along with all you say about me . but that ... you ca n't pretend no more on that . cuz i was just a kid momma .   i did n't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me .   and you let him do it . some big nobody in your life ... and you let him do as he wanted ... with the only somebody you had . 
i just think you should'a kept him off me that 's all . 
i just wanted some make - up . 
yeah . i know i did . but ...   i 'm tryin ' to be dif'rent . i 'm tryin ' to ... get some peace you know ?

did n't know you was workin ' here now ? 
the hell you call me ? 
just a cough . sugar and a spoonful of jack'll do it .

that damned rusty radiator bout burned the skin off my legs each time i passed .

i 'm not ready to grow old laz . livin ' with you . i feel it . like i 'm one foot in the dirt . saw it happen to my momma . and that 's not gon na happen to me . i got living to do .

ca n't remember the last time i saw you in that suit . 
maybe .   if i come visit we can find out . 
last time you asked me to come along i nearly got a hole in my head . 
would n't help .   watch out for ich . 
i still think you 're a bastard . 
bullshit nick .   and do n't tell me this is all just about charlie . it 's not . 
you 'll get ich killed . 
the cheese ... 
this little guy thinks you 're robert redford ... the other one thinks you 're charles bronson ... 
they want your autograph . 
i do n't remember saying yes . 
' nam oyo ranged kyo . '   you think it 's dumb of course . 
i 'd invite you up but i know you 'd hate the incense .   i chant . 
you met her . 
he 's got a reason . 
you 're wrong to sell ich short . 
and i 'm supposed to care ? 
my japanese is n't that hot ... besides you 'll never get in . 
i 've heard of sugai .   i 've also heard of the emperor .   they 're both national treasures .   one 's a hood . 
where 's ich ? 
somebody must be suffering somewhere you 're being so nice . 
i paid for that . 
do n't be an ass . 
she ever pull down her shades ? 
i do n't think so . 
look you need ich .   i 've been here five years and i still ca n't read all the street signs . 
you have a helluva way of asking for help . 
i do n't give tours . 
an outside person .   a foreigner .   a barbarian .   you me .   more you . 
dead gaiijin 's are big news . 
ich said you left . 
he gets as much as he wants . 
i want to do it . 
i think therefore i am . 
then we 're stupid and we 'll die . 
this is my uncle roy sebastian . 
tomorrow he says . 
he 's not ready yet . 
what makes you think so ? 
sebastian does n't like to go out too much . 
as a matter of fact i did .   they 've got some work to do tonight but they 're gon na come tomorrow . 
is that why you 're still here ? 
what 's that ? 
what 's your problem ? 
and you live in this building all by yourself ? 
just better . 
whatcha doin' ? 
i was hoping you 'd say that . 
i 'm hungry j.f. 
we scared each other pretty good did n't we ? 
i have some but i have to find out where they are staying . 
they left . 
i do n't have one . 
i was tired and did n't have any place to go . 
that some of the folks around here are more programmed then me . 
you know what i think ? 
what difference will it make ? 
do you think i simulated what happened between us ? 
do n't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered ? 
why do you call it retire why do n't you call it murder ? 
ten years . 
uh - huh . 
have you ever known anybody a long time ? 
you 're sick deckard . 
this feels stupid . 
but then how can you ... 
but if i do n't plug it in how can i ... 
they could clean around the arrangement . 
it appears to be dirty -- why do n't you get somebody ? 
have you ever cleaned your apartment ? 
when was the last time you cleaned this place ? 
i 'm not sure .   is there a secret ? 
i do n't know ... i think i missed something . 
i do n't know i have nothing to compare it to .   i guess i thought there was something more to it . 
nobody is freer than when he dreams .   i read that . 
that 's another thing i ca n't do . 
did you cry when your father died ? 
i wish i could . 
do you dream ? 
what do people do in the afternoon ? 
how are you doing ? 
how come you 're not on the job ? 
where is he ? 
who is this ? 
you did n't hear me .   you were sleeping . 
i told you i 'd come back . 
there 's a lot i have n't done with a man before . 
what do you want me to do ? 
they probably want to find out when they were made . 
can you ?   i could n't . 
i 'm sorry . 
do i make you nervous ? 
so i 'm a piece of equipment . use me . 
you use your equipment do n't you ? 
two of us might be more effective than one . 
there 's two reasons a man rejects help .   either because he 's so good at what he does he does n't think he needs it or he 's so insecure he ca n't admit it . 
i think you need more help than you 've got . 
i know you think it complicates your work but i 'm here to help . 
it would be my child . 
that would be murder mr. deckard . 
i 'd never get an abortion . 
is this testing whether i 'm an android or a lesbian ? 
i 'd kill it . 
i 'd take him to the doctor . 
i would n't accept it .   also i 'd report the person who gave it to me to the police . 
for the responsibility of your power .   being a police bureaucrat you 've got more than your share . 
are you apprehensive ? 
of course not . 
but because your department ca n't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large it 's a problem .   correct mr. deckard ? 
it seems your department does n't believe out new unit is to the public benefit . 
we can make this work adam ! believe me ! i 'm very good at making things work ! 
... i do . 
adam .... you should go with dr. aron . it 's the best thing .   the best thing for you . i promise . 
hi adam .   this is uh .... 
neat . goodnight !

my pleasure . 
that 's right .   and i 'll see you in the morning in the lobby .   do you mind waiting outside for the taxi ? 
i want you to go back to the hotel now .   i 'll call you a cab . 
uh - huh . adam ? 
adam ... dumb question but humor me . have you ever had sex before ?

well you had better ! !

well you should be !   thanks to you my heart is in my neck ! 
what in the hell are you doing here ! ! you 're supposed to be over on san vicente boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut sophie ! !

do n't change the subject ! i want you to tell me the truth about yourself . 
you 're not from alaska !   where 'd you learn to dance like that ? !   and there are no starving people are there ? ! 
did you ? 
say something surprising . and funny . lie if need be . 
yeah .   could be .   go say hello romeo . looks like a healthy non - mutant to me . 
maybe . but that 's how it works . 
yeah sweet .   that 's a nice way of putting it . 
because we 're bitches !   look at her ! look at the expression on her face ! the walk the jewelry the fingernails .   please ! 
no way .

well ... yeah . okay . 
hey screw you ! okay ? you think i 'm just somebody you can buy off ! listen let me tell you something-- 
yes it is . a girlfriend maybe . but a wife ? i mean ... 
okay . but you know this business of finding you a wife -- it 's kind of ridiculous do n't you think ? 
yeah ? no kidding . listen you still want to go girl hunting tonight ? 
he 's going to kill himself .   go skate out on the bike path ! it 's that way ! 
what about holding your right arm up like that all the time ? 
that 's boring ! 
wazoo !   try to listen .   whataya think ? surfer grunge hip- hop euro trash ? 
so what are you seeing ? 
uh ... yeah . 
no .   we keep it in the backyard .   of course in the house .   it 's in there . 
he 's gone to check your answers on his computer . 
yeah right !   that 's where you 'd go to find girls !   nome .   he 's gay by the way . 
you live in ... alaska .   the only way in or out of your place is by plane and ... you 've definitely come down here for food and supplies and ... to find a wife ! 
i 'm seeing ... snow ... lots of snow . way up north .   are we getting hot ? 
okay let 's see ... i'm not promising anything . you okay ? 
i thought only hookers drank those things . 
here you go .   one champagne cocktail . 
what ? ! 
he 's a former boyfriend . we lived together for about six months .   and yes i 'll admit it .   i 've still kind of got a thing for him .   that 's what you wanted to know is n't it ? 
i was wrong ! ! 
never drive again ! 
you almost got us killed ! 
stop that ma'am crap ! 
now get out ! ! 
get out ! 
thank you . 
could we talk about that a little later ? 
well i could probably get you laid in two weeks but to locate a non - mutant wife from pasadena ... that could take some time . 
when do you need her by ? 
no dogs huh ? okay . 
i would n't know .   what kind of wife are you looking for ? 
everybody 's divorced . 
everybody knows that . ask my divorced sisters . or ask my divorced mom and dad . 
the big one ! 
you can be single and not alone . marriage bites ! 
why ? ! 
what for ? 
a wife ? 
think of me as your genie .   just ask . 
no no !   i 'm sorry !   what is it ? 
oh i 'm sure it will ! 
name it . 
now let 's take the truck back and get something to eat . 
adam ?   do n't even think about it . okay ? i 'm sorry .   i know that sounds mean but believe me it would be meaner if i did n't say it . okay ? 
thank you . 
no problem .   we 'll just sell another baseball card . 
it 's your life .   and by the way it 's a dandy . 
pick you up at eight tomorrow morning . 
well another day another dollar .   stop staring at me ! ! 
very funny smart ass .

i 've got to make at least a thousand a week . 
what 's the pay ? 
how long would you need me ? 
food and supplies ?   who for ?   like starving people ? 
doing what ? 
it never works out because i 'm into legs and butts and hair myself ! that 's why ! so i wind up with guys who are very good looking but even more shallow than i am if you can picture that . now if you 'll excuse me i have to go find another low - paying demeaning job where some guy named jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is . 
why ? !   who the hell knows ? ! 
see ya . 
hey no kidding ?   in color ? 
the eyes .   okay . an eye - man .   anyhow it never works out .   okay ?   not that you even need to know that !   you look like crap by the way .   what have you been doing ? 
oh stop that !   god ! listen i know you like me .   i can tell . but you know what ? a lot of guys like me .   not me exactly . it 's more like the legs or the butt or the hair .   or some combination of the above . 
okay !   damn ! 
i knew this would happen !   you 're like a lost puppy ! 
please do n't follow me .   do n't do it !

so for four thousand dollars all i have to do is drive you to your hotel ? 
rogers hornsby 's worth like four thousand dollars ! 
rogers hornsby ? ! ? 
get away from me ! ! 
well that changes everything . get the fuck away from me ! !   i mean it ! ! 
you do n't ? 
i 'm not taking you there sweetie . rule number one in north america : no strangers in the car . 
yeah . thanks . anyhow let me predict a bus for you to get on . 
see ? i 'm psychic . not completely but pretty much . that was pretty good was n't it ? ! 
where are you staying ? the holiday inn ? 
i knew it ! so anyhow you get on a bus and before you know it you 're out here in the san fernando valley without a clue .   which brings us to here .   correct again ? 
yes i 'm right ? 
let me guess something . this is your first visit to la la land . you 're staying somewhere over in hollywood because like an idiot you thought that would be an exciting place to stay .   right so far ? 
well i guess because i 'm a little psychic ... i have this thing . 
why does n't that surprise me ? 
here pick these up ! 
what 's wrong with you ? 
a walking penis capable of intelligent speech .   a dickhead . 
forget it .   i 'm sick of working for that dickhead . 
you 're lost ? 
we ? i 'm going home . and judging by that coat i 'd say you have to get back to the barber college . 
come on heathcliff i 'll walk you to the corner . 
no you get out of here . 
well your business must not be sports memorabilia because this one mantle card right here--   --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self . 
are you french ? 
i was frightened and i did n't know what to think ! but you know - i believe him . i think he just wants to go home . wherever the hell that is ... 
you know i do n't think so . i 'm confused but you know i do n't think he 'd ever hurt me . i do n't think he 'd hurt anyone . 
no i ca n't have that ! they 'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs-- 
no !   not the police !   do n't call them ! 
oh my god ! 
stop it you two ! 
go home adam .   go to your hotel . 
so where is your roommate the model ? 
go home cliff wherever that might be . 
this is adam .   adam meet cliff . 
you came back for these ? 
your stuff ?   let me see that . 
what are you doing here ? 
adam ! ! 
well we 've come a long way have n't we ?   i want to go home . 
why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop ? 
come on . 
what ? ! 
you did n't stop anywhere else ? ! 
then what ? 
well at least i fell for him before i found out he was rich ! that 's new .   wait a minute ! he said today he knew where home was . what happened this morning ? ! where did you go ? ! 
have him committed . 
i do n't know .   everything 's so neat . it 's all just so ... goddamn dear .   damn ! 
we 'll find him . 
give it back to him . 
good god ... you do n't think there really is a bomb shelter do you ? 
oh no ! 
well what was i supposed to do ? ! he wants me to live underground with him ! that 's like silence of the lambs do n't you think ? ! 
you 're goddamn right i am ! 
oh no ! not sophie ! no way ! please do n't tell me that ! ! 
what ? ! ! 
well ... i admit it . i 'm glad to hear that . 
so now i suppose he 's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible . 
where did he get all that information ? 
well consider the source . i do n't even know what a lady is . 
or have perfect table manners . 
or pee in their pants when they see the ocean ! 
and i do n't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards ! ! 
in the first place i do n't fall in love with weirdos i 've only known for four or five days . 
what ? !   now hold on !   wait one damn minute ! 
to bed ? 
where are you going ? 
those sluts ! 
i 'm his pimp . he left with the dancers did n't he ? 
who did he leave with ? 
what 's that mean ? 
he go back to the hotel ? 
go to the bathroom . 
it 's not so much what you say but how you say it .   women like men who are unpredictable . 
well i 'm trying to educate him !   it 's nothing personal . 
are you kidding ? !   you would n't even be a crumb on her table !   you do n't see that ? ! 
for him . it does n't work for the rest of us . 
just be yourself . 
that water 's freezing ! 
i think ... it ... works . 
i 'm busy tomorrow anyway . i have to buy six thousand paper napkins . 
yeah ? like ralph lauren ? 
and i suppose you see him in some sort of strapless   thing do n't you ? 
well that 's blunt ! 
what 's that supposed to mean ? 
money is no object .   he 's got cards up the wazoo . 
exactly .   you understand that do n't you ?   you have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that . 
give me your hand .

oh adamthat would be wonderful if you could find a girl . one who 's not a mutant ... and hopefully comes from pasadena . nothing against valley girls but in my day anyhow the girls from pasadena i do n't know ... always just seemed a little nicer . 
i just hope this is still good up there . 
i do n't know how far you 'll have to travel to find supplies but if you ca n't get home by nightfall i want you to look for something called a holiday inn . write that down . it 's a hotel . there might still be one standing .

jeffrey ? what 's going on ?

dorothy vallens ? 
oh my god . what 's wrong ? 
just a minute . 
you want to dance ? 
thank you . whatiya say we just enjoy the evening ? 
it 's okay . 
just go over to gelford and up to vista . it 's not far . can you tell me any more about what you learned ? 
it 's good to see you . 
what was that all about ? 
what is it ? 
i should never had gotten you going on this .   yes jeffrey . friday 's on ! 
you did n't tell him about me ? 
everything okay ? 
jeffrey are they important things ? well forget me - you have to tell him . jeffrey i mean it . 
yes . is that so surprising ? yeah i worry a lot . i got you into this . 
you like mysteries that much ? 
jeffrey ? why ? 
i ca n't believe what you are finding out . are you going to continue with this . are you going back to her apartment ? 
jeffrey ! ! 
oh yeah ? 
nothing really but it 's interesting . they know each other . they seem to like each other . 
you know that cheese is practically all chemicals . 
yeah but i do n't think it 's going to do much good . let 's go . i 'll try to talk to him later . 
what am i going to do ? 
you were late . 
you better not jeffrey . 
okay be careful . 
no silly - i 'm still in school you know . but i 'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you 've learned . you better be careful jeffrey . 
so are you .   i mean you 're a neat guy . we better get back . 
i do n't know . i had a dream . in fact the night i met you .   in the dream the world was dark because there were n't any robins . you know birds . robins stood for love and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love . and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference . i guess until the robins come there is trouble . 
you 're sure right . it is a strange world . 
who me ? why should it ? 
did you see her undressed ? 
twice . without her sensing anything ? 
you saw a lot in one night . 
wow . should you tell my father ? 
you want to tell me about it ? 
you want a dairy queen ? 
it 's okay . do n't worry about it . 
he got a little jealous . 
what did you see ? 
well how did it go ? what happened ? 
okay okay . bye . 
i do n't know if you 're a detective or a pervert . 
i 'll honk four times so you 'll hear it and know she 's on her way up . okay ? 
i 'm going to wait here until she comes . 
call tomorrow . it 's okay . good luck . i hope you can sneak out okay . you 're going to wait until she 's asleep ? 
okay yeah call . 
i i do n't want to see you tomorrow . mike 's coming over . 
i wish you would n't do this . it does n't make any sense . let 's go somewhere and have some coffee . 
yeah but . 
it 's crazy and dangerous . my god i should n't have told you . 
jeffrey i do n't think you ought to do it . 
i 'll drink to that . 
that sounds good . 
this is not my usual friday night ! 
what 's the plan . 
yeah but do n't pick me up . my father may think it 's strange . i 'll walk over to your house . i 'll be there at eight o'clock . 
i 'll tell mike i 'm sick . there 's a game tonight anyway and he 'll never miss me . afterwards he can go out with the guys . just so the record is kept straight though i love mike . what do want me to do ? 
you really want to do this do n't you ? 
yes . i do . 
i owe you since i goofed up this one . 
so what 's next ? 
yeah if it opens the door . 
no . i only saw his back . he went down another stairwell at the end of the hall . 
i was just about to go to the door when that man did my job for me . was it alright ? 
are you alright ? 
alright . good luck yourself . 
oh brother . dorothy vallens seventh floor . look on the mailbox for her number bright boy . 
you 've got a point there . 
i do n't know it sounds like a good daydream but actually doing it is too weird . too dangerous . 
what will i say when she comes to the door ? 
now how are you going to do that ? 
it would n't hurt to hear the plan i guess . 
you said it was a strange world . and you 're the strangest part of it . are you crazy ? she is possibly involved in murder . this gives me the creeps . 
alright now tell me . what is it ? 
ooooo you are smart . just do n't get too smart . 
i 'm here are n't i ? 
just a minute pull over and wait a minute . 
i do n't know . 
i guess so . like you said . it 's a strange world . 
i 've got ta go in . 
what happened to him ? 
still it must be kinda rough . 
yeah i guess so .   what are you going to do now that you 're home ? 
my father is watching the businessman . the businessman had a partner who disappeared . left his whole business and family his wife and two kids . they think he 's been murdered . 
i do n't know like i said she 's not my father 's case . 
i do n't know you 're not supposed to see them . they 're supposed to see you . 
that 's the building . she lives on the seventh floor . do n't stop to look long the police are watching . 
not really why ?   you want to see the building ? come on i 'll show you . 
yeah . it 's close by that 's what 's creepy . they 've had her under surveillance for a couple of months except i do n't know what they 've found out because my father is n't in charge of her . 
maybe so . 
no this has been going on for some time . several months . about six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river . they were from people who were reported missing . they never found one complete body only parts . 
there were at least three maybe four . but a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear . there 's also a business man over by the franklin factory district that was questioned . and a musician . and some others . 
i do n't really know much but bits and pieces . i hear things . my room is right above my father 's office . the ear there 's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear and it did come off a living person . that 's direct from the coroner 's office . the person is unknown . there are a couple of cases i get mixed up on but i think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear . i heard some of the same names . 
did n't my father tell you not to talk about it ? 
that 's too bad . 
yeah . what are you doing now ? 
terrible boring . 
am i bothering you ? 
you were pretty popular . did n't you run for some office ? 
i just know that 's all . i remember you from central . 
stop it mike . 
sure just a sec .   excuse me . 
mike . we do n't have to watch it . come on . 
you can change it if you want to . 
mike 's got ta go .   nice to meet you . 
no . you lost your way . 
no good options left ? 
and danny zorn what was that ? 
and pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it . 
' why ' would be enough for me . 
i 'd rather stand if it 's all the same to you . 
i 'm sorry ward . 
do n't know . 
did he say anything to you ? 
they found danny zorn 's body . dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time . 
sorry to wake you . 
well whatever he 's doing i 've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission .   i want the berlin police fully briefed and --   -- get this out to all the agencies . 
so what 's he doing ? you believe him ? 
do n't you want answers ? 
hold on -- he said he wants to come in . 
and you do ? from the moment he left treadstone he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him ... 
i 've already got a team there . i doubt bourne 's in naples to settle down and raise a family . 
what 's definitive is that i just lost two people in berlin ! 
may i finish ? 
excuse me . 
... at the time of his death conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven - hundred and sixty thousand dollars . 
... this is conklin 's computer . 
... ivan mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new russian petroleum companies pecos oil . he claimed to know where the money landed . we believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the agency ... this ... 
i think i do . we had a deal going down in berlin last week . during the buy both our field agent and the seller were killed . we pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that did n't go off .   they were killed by jason bourne . 
and bourne ? where 's he now ? 
so you had conklin killed .   i mean if we 're cutting the crap ... 
i want to know what happened . 
let 's talk about conklin . 
he does . i 've been down to the archives . i have the files ward . 
i want to know about treadstone . 
that 's not gon na fly . 
why you 're alive ?   you 're alive because you 're special . because she kept you alive .   because we want you back on our side . 
sounds like a threat . 
do you think you can read ? are you well enough ? 
thank you for your gift . i 'm sorry about marie . 
are you disappointed ? 
ramstein air base germany .   before the wall fell you would have woken up in a russian prison hospital . 
okay jason your move . 
okay how do you want to do it ? 
what do you want ? 
what ? the tapes ? 
we 'll know for sure when we get the security tapes . 
this stays between you and i.   we finally have an edge . i do n't want to lose it . 
alright ... take it down . 
i want to look at the room .   check it out . 
-- the hotel -- how far ? -- 
-- uplink all relevant files to kim --   -- and i want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with treadstone -- 
then get a number they need to know who they 're dealing with . 
who 's going ? us ? 
and the germans ca n't match it ? 
we need to get in there . 
i think that bourne and conklin were in business . that bourne is still involved . and that whatever information i was going to buy in berlin it was big enough to make bourne come out from wherever he 's been hiding to kill again .   how 's that scan ? 
for a thief . a mole . i vetted the source marty . he 's real . if it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects it 's a bargain at ten times the price . 
we 're talking raw unprocessed kgb files . it 's not something we can go out and comparison shop . 
that 's where we came out . 
felt promising . it 's a start . 
let 's give him half an hour . 
what do you think ? is he coming in ? 
is it fresh ? 
and why is that ? 
see that 's a problem for me nicky . whatever he 's doing we need to end it . this is n't the kind of mess you walk away from . 
some women like dobermans -- 
did you ? 
you felt nothing ? no spark ? two young people in paris ? dangerous missions ? life and death ? 
not good enough . you 're the person who floated this amnesia story .   ever feel sorry for him ? for what he 'd been through ? 
so he fooled you . 
believed what ? 
are you an expert in amnesia ? 
i 'm curious about bourne . your interpretation of his condition . you have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions ? 
you were his local contact . you were with him the night conklin died . you 're coming with us . 
what kind of problems ? 
and what about you anything ? 
are we hacking or asking ? 
alright ... i want you kurt and kim to stay on bourne track everything that 's out there ... 
by who ? 
yeah that 'll work ... what the hell was he doing here ? 
are we locked up ? 
do we know what this says ? 
is this really happening ? 
because you 're afraid ! 
i should kill you ... if it 's true you should die ... i should kill you now ! 
you're a liar ! 
you 're a liar . 
how ... how can ... how can you be here and say this ? 
you killed them . 
then what ? 
no i do . 
it 's nothing . it 's just a picture . 
i speak english . 
jason . you know exactly what to do . that is your mission now . 
you do ? 
it would n't have changed the way you feel . 
but you found another choice . 
i love you too . 
jason please do n't do this ... it wo n't ever be over like this . 
there must be another way ! 
what if it 's not who you think it is ? 
where are you going ? 
-- hang on -- 
-- it 's just him ? -- 
jesus ! --   -- is he back there ? -- 
-- where ? - 
-- where 's left to go ? -- 
i do n't want to move again ... i like it here . 
... but you 're not -- you 're not sure ... 
that 's crazy . 
but you 're sure ? 
but we were so careful . 
no ... how ? 
one day it will be different . it just takes time .   we 'll make new memories . you and me . 
you are better . and i think it 's not memories at all . it 's just a dream you keep having over and over . 
sleep . sleep now . 
i do n't mean that . i worry when you try to ignore it . 
i worry when you get like this . 
we write them down because sooner or later you 're going to remember something good . 
-- it has n't been two years -- 
you 're sure ?   we should still -- we should write it down . 
i 'll get the book . 
where were you jason ? in the car . 
... it 's not in the file ... i swear ... i know your file ... your first job was geneva ! ... i swear to god you never worked here ! ... 
no ... jason ... please ... 
you never worked berlin ... 
your first assignment was geneva . 
no . you never worked berlin . 
what do you mean ? 
he closed down treadstone -- he took care of me after paris ... 
please -- i 'm only here because of paris -- because they ca n't figure out what you 're doing -- i 'm here because of abbott -- 
conklin ! stuff on conklin ! 
you left a print ! there was kel that did n't go off ! there was a partial print they tracked it back to treadstone ! they know it 's you ! 
and you got to him before we could . 
it was pamela landy 's op . the guy was going to sell - out a mole or something . i have n't been debriefed on exactly what it was . 
last week an agency field officer went to make a buy from a russian national . 
what is this a game ? 
they know !   they know you were here . they know you killed these two guys . they know you and conklin had something on the side . they do n't know what it is but they know ! 
you hear me ? i believed you . 
i did ... jason i swear i did ... i told them ... i told them i believed you ... 
i do n't know . he was sick . he wanted out . i believed him . 
it 's got caffeine in it . that 's all i know . 
because he 's doing just what he said he 'd do . he 's coming for us . 
i do n't think we need to keep looking for him anyway . 
what do you want from me ? i was reassigned . i 'm out . 
these were killers . conklin had them all jacked up . they were dobermans . 
you mean did i want a date ? 
you 're making it out like we 're friends here or something . i met him alone twice . 
if you say so . 
i believed jason bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown . 
look what do you want me to say ? i was there . i believed him . 
am i a doctor no but ... 
good luck . 
before this ? before bourne ? no . 
depression . anger . compulsive behaviors . they had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light -- 
nor you . to you that word is as unfamiliar as love . 
i respect him . at worst he was a worthy enemy . show mercy ... oh thou great king ... and win the respect of your own people . 
i have come to beg for the life of william wallace . 
when will his trial be ? 
is it true ? wallace is captured ? 
grant as you do everything else with treachery . offer him a truce to discuss terms and send me to my castle at locharmbie as your emissary . he trusts me . pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along . and i will set the meeting and the ambush . 
wallace himself . if you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every scottish town i leave you to your hauntings . if you wish to take him i know a way . 
i am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries . all of england shudders with the news of renewed rebellion . 
good day to you m'lords . 
yes . i had thought that ... i was loathsome to you . perhaps i am . if i may be excused m'lord . 
no m'lord . 
... his majesty was quite keen that you should understand -- 
scotland . he intends -- 
you directed me to report to you the moment the king 's conference was ended . 
he will fight you forever . but what does he fight for ? freedom first and peace . so grant them . 
i have faced him . have you ? 
forgive me sire . i thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule . 
no . i have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war . 
humbly m'lord . 
... a mindless barbarian . not a king like you m'lord . 
he waits . for you . he says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him . 
no . he did not . 
shall i leave m'lord ? 
your pardon m'lord he asked me to come in his stead . 
... i would n't know . 
this scottish rebel ... wallace ? he fights to avenge a woman ? 
he should n't be telling secrets in bed . 
how do you know this ? 
i ca n't bear the thought of your torture . take it ! 
drink this ! it will dull your pain . 
you will die ! it will be awful ! 
mercy ... is to die quickly . perhaps even live in the tower . in time who knows what can happen if you can only live . 
sir i ... come to beg you to confess all and swear allegiance to the king that he might show you mercy . 
no . but can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost ? or simply love me ... because i love you ? 
you understand . consider before you laugh and say no . you will never own a throne though you deserve one . but just as the sun will rise tomorrow some man will rule england . and what if his veins ran not with the blood of longshanks but with that of a true king ? 
i have taken vows . more than one . i 've vowed faithfulness to my husband and sworn to give him a son . and i can not keep both promises . 
because of the way you 're looking at me now . the same way ... as when we met . 
it does me good to see you . 
i understand you have suffered . i know ... about your woman . 
peace is made is such ways . 
let us talk plainly . you invade england . but you can not complete the conquest so far from your shelter and supply . the king proposes that you withdraw your attack . in return he grants you title estates and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold which i am to pay to you personally . 
that is not possible . 
did god make you the sacker of peaceful cities ? the executioner of the king 's nephew my husband 's own cousin ? 
i understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight . 
but now that i am here will you speak with a woman ? 
i come as the king 's servant and with his authority . 
i am the princess of wales . 
... tonight ! 
my parents are growing suspicious ! i ca n't keep meeting you every night ! 
shush . it 's only been a day .   and it 's seemed like forever . 
this night is too beautiful to have again . 
you scare me . 
nor i ! 
i ... accept your proposal ! 
did it work ? 
you 've been here before ? 
you are . and i 'll come again . 
thank you for inviting . 
it 's not you . he dislikes that you 're a wallace . he just says ... the wallaces do n't seem to live for very long . 
wake up william . wake up ! 
and i with you . but you must wake . 
yes you are . and you must wake . 
thank you for showing it to me first . i 'll ... i 'll take care of it . can i have the picture ? 
what is it ? 
i 'm sorry but can it wait til tonight ? i 'm already late for work -- 
no dances just tell me . 
so what did you find . 
evan wake up oh please wake up ! 
how soon ? ... 
well he has been pushing me to meet his father but i 've been putting it off . 
come on i doubt the answer 's that simple . 
but he 's seven . what kind of stress can he have ? 
but you must have something to go on ? 
and the bad news ? 
why ? what for ? 
just tell me that evan does n't have jason 's illness ... 
not according to his teacher . it just got me thinking about jason and what if evan 's inherited his father 's condition ? 
just . like . jason . 
how . did you . know that ? 
you 're . acting . like your father . 
what does that mean for evan ? 
cute evan . 
fine . you 'll get them evan . but i think it 's far more important to focus on your case right now . 
i found these . the others are still in storage . 
i do n't know . these things take time . 
... i spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal . he 's sure he can get you off on self - defense so if you 're patient . 
and then just before it got so bad that he had to be committed he said that he could ... 
i could n't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms . you know he might only have thought he actually remembered them ... 
when he was around your age ... almost exactly your age . he said he figured out a trick to remember the past . 
why do you ask ? 
please . he got straight a 's without ever touching a book . that was the one area where his memory never failed him . 
i ca n't help it . i 'm just so proud of you . you 've got the highest grades in all of your classes . 
do n't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one ! 
something must 've happened ! what set him off ? 
now your father may seem sleepy to you but that 's just because of his medicine okay ? 
honey . what were you doing with that ? 
great . i 'll see you soon . 
that 's why i wanted you to come here evan . dr. redfield already has a background in memory loss . 
you 'll be fine . dr. redfield just wants to give you some tests . you 'll like him . 
good . because i 've been waiting to see your art projects all week and i 'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there . 
i get the point kiddo . but i 'm not so bad am i ? 
we 've been over this a hundred times . it 's too dangerous for him . 
you know the answer to that . 
darn it ! 
thanks . do n't worry evan you 'll have plenty of time . 
when did you ever care about getting to school on time ? 
why not ? but that 's not how things wound up . i 'm with lenny lenny 's your friend . and there it ends . 
well a lot of things cross my mind . i 've always been a fast thinker ev . i can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second . boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we relatively stable relationships matching burial plots the whole bit . it took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine . 
it 's crossed my mind from time to time . 
when my folks split they gave me and tommy a choice who we wanted to live with . i could n't stand my dad but i knew if i moved to my mom 's i 'd never see you again . 
that 's why when i was little i never went to live with my mother . 
sure evan why not ? you were the first person i really ever cared about . 
is something the matter ? 
you know how spiritual he 's gotten ever since he saved mrs. halpern and katie . 
we have to get you to sunnyvale . you 're having one of your famous hemorrhages . 
well do n't give up now slick . you 've already done so much for me . hell why do n't you go back in time and save mrs. halpern and her baby . then maybe lenny would n't freak out and ruin my family . 
off to change everyone 's life again is that it ? maybe this time you 'll pop up in some mansion while i wind up in tijuana doing the donkey act . 
sure you do n't want your wallet ? 
there is no fuckin ' way on this planet or any other that i was in some fuckin ' sorority . 
there 's one major hole in your story . 
know what ? 
anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that . 
oh ? there 's proof now ? 
i 'm the only person you 've told ? that 's a great line . does that make other girls swoon ? do they actually eat up this bullshit ? 
you 're right evan i do n't believe you . 
on the bridge . how did you know that tommy had your dog ? that was no fucking hunch . 
let me ask you a question . just a little one that 's been gnawing at me for years . 
because you 're ... different . 
i 've seen some sickening shit . i do n't blink twice anymore especially in your case . 
what 's happened to you ? 
ha ! where 's that ? 
oh i 'm sorry . does my line of work make you uncomfortable precious ? 
so how 's tricks ? sorry occupational humor . 
oh i thought you were my eight o'clock . make it fast i 'm expecting someone . 
evan . stop it . it 's not the time . 
evan stop ! you 're gon na kill him ! 
wait . something 's not right . is n't that your jacket ? 
i ca n't put my finger on it but everything 's a bit off . even the dinner tonight . it was beautiful but ... 
i do n't know . you seem ... different . you make weird jokes . your accents changed . you do n't even walk the same . 
it 's just ... you 've been acting kinda strange you know ? 
are you okay ? 
my father never laid a hand on me . it 's like the prick saved it all up for tommy . 
it 's not his fault evan . you knew how bad he had it when we were kids . 
please evan . do n't even joke . he would n't hurt you . he 's just trying to scare you away from me . 
it 's my fault . i should have told you he was released a few weeks ago . 
why are you doing all this for me ? 
i do n't know what to say . it 's beautiful . 
i do n't understand where are you taking me ? 
as if my dad could 've stopped me from seeing you . what 's he gon na do to me ? 
yeah if you call multiple orgasms weird . 
oh my god that was good . where 'd you learn all those new tricks ? 
well i remember he had one ... but he like put it away after the first day . why would that freak me out ? 
those are your clothes silly . 
mmmm ... you give good compliment . clean up and come back to bed . 
who are you trying to convince evan ? ! you come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory ! ? you want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything 's all better now ? well fuck you evan ! nothing 's gon na be all better ! okay ? ! nothing ever gets better ! 
just shut up evan . you 're wasting your breath . 
is that why you came all the way back ? to ask a lot of stupid questions about robin hood ? 
it was a long time ago . 
what do you want to know evan ? 
well sure . i 'll try to remember . shoot . 
of course . 
me ? are you kidding ? why ? 
she had a new family . not enough space for me . said i should have moved in with her when we were kids . but ... whatever . 
not if you remember my dad . 
no . i emancipated myself when i was fifteen . 
they kept him in juvy for a few years . now he works over at dale 's autobody . 
i 've stopped a hundred times . 
no evan . i do n't know . it 's been a long time . fill me in . 
god evan ! i never thought i 'd see you again . how 've you been ? 
hi lenny . 
did your mom say if lenny was ... okay ? 
he 's been acting real strange lately . he wo n't even look me in the eyes anymore . 
i deserve a lot worse . 
it 's not your fault . mrs. kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to lenny . 
you really do n't remember anything that happened ? 
oh god ... what did we do ? 
we should go soon . if dad catches us smoking down here we 're dead . 
shut up tommy ! 
oh my god oh my god ... 
i 'm sorry . 
where the hell are you taking us anyway ? just blow something up already . 
you are silly . he 's a bad sheriff . 
quit it tommy . evan gets to be robin hood . i 'm gon na be maid marian and you 're the sheriff of nottingham ! 
evan guess what ? dad got a new video camera and we 're all gon na be in a movie . 
monsieur rick i -- 
oh but if you knew what it means to us to leave europe to get to america ! oh but if jan should find out ! he is such a boy . in many ways i am so much older than he is . 
oh yes please . 
and he never knew and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart ? that would be all right would n't it ? 
-- will he keep his word ? 
yes monsieur . 
oh yes . 
he tells me he can give us an exit visa but we have no money . 
yes but we have not much money and traveling is so expensive and difficult . it was much more than we thought to get here . and then captain renault sees us and he is so kind . he wants to help us . 
eight weeks . we come from bulgaria . oh things are very bad there monsieur . a devil has the people by the throat . so jan and i we we do not want our children to grow up in such a country . 
at the roulette table trying to win enough for our exit visa . well of course he 's losing . 
he did . captain renault did . 
no i mean is he trustworthy ? is his word -- 
monsieur rick what kind of man is captain renault ? 
my husband is with me too . 
i came with captain renault . 
could i speak to you for just a moment please ? 
monsieur rick ? 
and the other alternative ? 
what are they ? 
what value is that ? you may recall what german guarantees have been worth in the past . 
occupied france ? 
this morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave casablanca . 
you need n't be concerned about me . 
and i said i would never leave you . 
but what about us ? 
but richard no i i -- 
no richard no . what has happened to you ? last night we said -- 
i do n't understand . what about you ? 
but why my name richard ? 
oh rick ! 
but it 's all right is n't it ? you were able to arrange everything ? 
richard victor thinks i 'm leaving with him . have n't you told him ? 
i wish i did n't love you so much . 
i ca n't fight it anymore . i ran away from you once . i ca n't do it again . oh i do n't know what 's right any longer . you 'll have to think for both of us for all of us . 
oh you 'll help him now richard wo n't you ? you 'll see that he gets out ? then he 'll have his work all that he 's been living for . 
now ? i do n't know . i know that i 'll never have the strength to leave you again . 
just before you and i were to leave paris together . a friend came and told me that victor was alive . they were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of paris . he was sick he needed me . i wanted to tell you but i i did n't care . i knew i knew you would n't have left paris and the gestapo would have caught you . so i ... well well you know the rest . 
oh it was n't my secret richard . victor wanted it that way . not even our closest friends knew about our marriage . that was his way of protecting me . i knew so much about his work and if the gestapo found out i was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me . 
for the last time put them on the table . 
put them on the table . 
-- all right . i tried to reason with you . i tried everything . now i want those letters . get them for me . 
no . oh richard i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry but but you you are our last hope . if you do n't help us victor laszlo will die in casablanca . 
please . please listen to me . if you knew what really happened if you only knew the truth -- 
richard richard we loved each other once . if those days meant anything at all to you -- 
it was your cause too . in your own way you were fighting for the same thing . 
i know how you feel about me but i 'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important . 
you can ask any price you want but you must give me those letters . 
richard i had to see you . 
the stairs from the street . 
no rick . no you see victor laszlo is my husband ... and was even when i knew you in paris . 
you can believe that if you want to . 
last night i saw what has happened to you . the rick i knew in paris i could tell him . he 'd understand . but the one who looked at me with such hatred ... well i 'll be leaving casablanca soon and we 'll never see each other again . we knew very little about each other when we were in love in paris . if we leave it that way maybe we 'll remember those days and not casablanca not last night . 
i do n't think i will rick . 
it does n't matter . 
i would n't have come if i had known that you were here . believe me rick it 's true . i did n't know . 
no . no rick . not tonight . 
i love you so much and i hate this war so much . oh it 's a crazy world . anything can happen . if you should n't get away i mean if if something should keep us apart wherever they put you and wherever i 'll be i want you to know ... 
oh darling ! 
that 's too far ahead to plan . 
no no . not at my hotel . i uh i have things to do in the city before i leave . i 'll meet you at the station huh ? 
yes of course we -- 
but be serious darling . you are in danger and you must leave paris . 
strange . i know so very little about you . 
was that cannon fire or is it my heart pounding ? 
ten years ago ? let 's see ...   ... yes . i was having a brace put on my teeth . where were you ? 
with the whole world crumbling we pick this time to fall in love . 
it 's the gestapo . they say they expect to be in paris tomorrow . 
richard they 'll find out your record . it wo n't be safe for you here . 
well only one answer can take care of all our questions . 
that 's easy . there was . he 's dead . 
why there is no other man in my life ? 
i 'm willing to be overcharged . tell me . 
a franc for your thoughts . 
say goodnight to sam for me . 
yes . i put that dress away . when the germans march out i 'll wear it again . 
how nice . you remembered . but of course that was the day the germans marched into paris . 
play it once sam for old time 's sake . 
you used to be a much better liar sam . 
does he always leave so early ? 
when will he be back ? 
where is rick ? 
some of the old songs sam . 
it 's been a long time . 
hello sam . 
yes i 'm ready .   goodbye rick . god bless you . 
be careful . 
yes yes i know . victor whatever i do will you believe that i that -- 
no victor there is n't . 
yes victor i was . 
-- yes ? 
ask me ? 
did he give any reason ? 
whatever i 'd say you 'd carry on . victor why do n't you tell me about rick ? what did you find out ? 
do n't joke . after major strasser 's warning tonight i am frightened . 
victor please do n't go to the underground meeting tonight . 
what happened with rick ? 
he does . could we have a table close to him ? 
yes i see . when i had trouble getting out of lille why did n't you leave me there ? and when i was sick in marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time why did n't you leave me then ? 
but victor if the situation were different if i had to stay and there were only a visa for one would you take it ? 
no victor no . 
we are only interested in two visas signor . 
be careful . 
victor i 'm afraid for you . 
you are very kind . 
victor i i feel somehow we should n't stay here . 
you 're saying this only to make me go . 
i was n't sure you were the same . let 's see the last time we met -- 
-- this is mr. laszlo . 
hello rick .

olive told me .   you might have told me yourself . 
we have to wait and see . i think that for * everything * in life you have to wait and see . 
it will be okay . 
i * know * this was right . 
nobody will swim here until next summer . by then the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand -- there wo n't be any sharp edges . 
not with the right girl you would n't . 
you just cuddle . you come to hug ... to kiss . you do n't * come * here to watch the movie . 
the * speaker * . for the movie sound . 
sometimes ... movies mostly bore wally . 
privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies . 
just a little privacy . 
but you had so much * responsibility * . 
you do n't miss it ? 
at least you were never lonely . 
what are you so crazy about the movies for ? 
yes ... and no . when you come here you do n't really care about the movie . 
you 're a natural . you were born to drive a car like this . 
she was torn apart ! she died of a broken heart . 
she * did * love him !   how many women have you known ? 
but you looked as if you liked it . 
you 've seen only one movie ? which one ? 
when they watched at all . do you like movies ? 
yes . but it 's closed all the time now because of the blackout .

it 's more like what are n't i doing . my partners and i are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company . we tried the venture capitalist route in the valley but then again who has n't up there . 
oh god . i 'm overbearing and rude . lily . lily finn . 
brutal day . they say the streets are lined with money down here but i guess you have to know the secret handshake . what are you drinking ? 
thanks for playing along . i just have to sit for a while . 
but i 'm not that late . you did n't have to give away my seat . 
that 's it ? what are you talking about ? we can still do this ! 
so what ? we just stay clear of him . 
i 'm going home 
it 's alright . grant 's one of the good guys . 
so far masters of our own demise . what bank are you with ? 
no i want my cut ! 
you sold me out . you should have trusted me like i trusted you . you fucked up . you fucked up huge . 
you got my cell . leave a message . 
your friend big al ? it should have been you . 
no i want my cut ! 
what about the money ? 
what about ... 
everyone 's working an angle right ? 
you are such a raving pussy sometimes . 
jesus ... take it easy . 
you know why i told you that jake ?   because i trust you too . 
i do n't know . i packed up my shit and ran away . to this ... so unlike you i guess i do have something to prove in a repressed anger sort of way . 
after glenn was finished he gave me a couple of valiums and i went home . the next day i finished my shift and met him around back like we always did . i stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest . three or four times . 
shit what was that guy 's name ? i really liked him . 
sort of . i was telling him about this great love of my life who 's name i do n't remember and i could see ... he was getting pissed . i thought it was just because he was worried about me but ... he told me that i was stupid because my boyfriend did n't really love me . 
no we never got busted . we were done with a shift one night both a couple of percocets down and i was telling glenn about my boyfriend about how we were thinking about doing it you know ? i was thinking about letting him be my first because i loved him .   what the hell was his name ? 
we were friends . i trusted him . i should have known it was weird . but then again i was weird . 
he was n't my boyfriend . i had a boyfriend at the time ... what was his name ? anyway glenn was like thirty . i was only fifteen . but he was a nice guy . real sweet . liked to talk . we used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to morrisey or some stupid shit like that . 
not the way i did it . i was loaded half the time . i do n't know how you could change bedpans sober . i used to hang out with this guy glenn . he was an x - ray technician or something . 
who says you have to know the king to be in a hole ? i actually did have a real job once . when i was in high school i worked as a candy striper . 
you have really soft hands . like a baby 's . 
how do you know i will ? 
so that was my part ? smile and shake my ass ? 
it 's more than that . 
whatever . but you ... i get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything . so why this ? 
i 'm your basic underachiever . ca n't stand working and porn does n't seem like a good option . 
do you have something to prove ? 
why ? your mother not breast feed you or something ? 
i think you 'd do it for free . you 're almost drooling . you like the rush . 
look at you ... you want to go . 
we 're getting down to the wire . apparently another company has a similar product in r&d right now . if they beat us to it ... 
did i miss something ? 
you told me to change my hair ! 
lighten up . 
i got ta go get a haircut . 
he 's gone . 
uh ... everything okay ? 
then show me how . 
you 're just going to have to trust me . 
it 's just that i left my asshole decoder ring at home so how do i know not to worry ? 
what the hell 's his problem ? 
mr. king i think -- 
hey i 'm not just along for the ride so i do n't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut . 
what about customs ? 
what do i have to do ? 
no .   what 's my cut ? 
here 's my deal -- do n't waste my time . what do you want me for anyway ? you do n't even know me . 
gee thanks . now i do n't have to find that bridge to jump off . 
oooh . sassy . what do you care who feels me up jake ? unless it kinda gotcha going . did it jake ? getcha going ? 
says who ? 
sorry about your wallet but if you think i 'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars a maxed out visa and a bad fake i.d. you 're fucking crazy .   jake . 
that 's not -- 
what is this ? you guys cops or something ? 
what are you laughing at ? who was that on the phone ? 
you 're all scumbags . 
your boyfriend fucked me smoked my dope then shopped me . what do you think of that ? i ca n't get a job now .   you bastard . you 're no different from matt . a pair of vicious little shits that 's what you are . 
reynolds got a doctor in . they forced me to take a dope test . it was positive . as you knew . 
you fucking little shit ! you shopped me . 
look now i 'm pumping you . i 'm sorry . it 's none of my business . it 's just that you 're not like the others . 
ah we all say that . but if we hate it why do we do it ? 
i 've been watching you work . you 're the best in the place . but you know that . 
well it is . but i know where i am . 
can you ? i 'm happy being a dealer . at least the punters keep their hands to themselves . 
i got scared . 
but do n't worry i 'm clean as a whistle . i only did s & m.   no blow jobs . no screwing . 
all men are cheats . 
you 're shaking . 
i 'll take you up on that . 
my car 's in the garage . 
jack . do you need a ride ? 
how do i look ? 
hi jack .   welcome to the cesspit . 
i 'm bella . 
how can anyone be that naive ? 
why did you take the money ? 
you 're already alone . 
here ... use a spoon . 
give up being a croupier jack . or i 'll shop you . all you have to do is keep your word . it 's that simple . 
nothing about you . 
it 's probably easier for you to eat the rice . 
i do n't want a criminal for a boyfriend . 
i thought you would n't want to spend christmas day alone in here . 
i can just imagine being around so much money all the time ... 
are n't you ever tempted to gamble ? 
you were talking in your sleep . 
you will ? 
it 's none of my business what you write . and your job that 's none of my business either . i love you . and i 've done everything wrong . 
-- i do n't care about her . of course i was angry . but not with you . the book is yours not mine . i was wrong what i said about it . i hurt you did n't i ? 
i hope it brings you luck . 
no . answer it ! 
the door jack . 
crap . it 's not relative . it 's unfair . like your casino . it 's designed unfair . and your croupier 's a little shit because he goes along with it . 
without hope there 's no point to anything . 
oh really . then why is he called jake . why do n't you come clean and call him jack .   there 's no hope in it . 
i do n't give a fuck about the sex . most men'll fuck a lamppost . he 's just a miserable zombie . is that the way you feel now ? is that what 's happened to you ? 
is that your idea of a winner ? he does n't give a shit about anyone . he uses people and -- 
i do n't like it at all . you had a wonderful character before the gambler . he was so romantic . 
i do n't like it . 
well that 's our life now is n't it ? 
i do n't finish till eight . make it nine and you 're on . 
what are you doing here ?   you know the rules . 
have n't you got a conscience of your own ? 
what do i mean to you ? i want to know . tell me . 
well that 's my poor upbringing . i did n't go to no private school . i have n't got no class . i want to live with a writer . not a fucking croupier . i do n't even know what the word means . croupier . 
this fucking job 's getting to you . you have n't written a fucking word since you started . 
are you drunk ? 
take that back !   fucking take that back . i 'm not a cop any more . 
where 've you been ? i 've got to give evidence in court at nine . 
when you get home i 'm asleep . when i leave home you 're asleep . 
i loved it blond . 
poor baby .   this 'll relax you . 
you 're shaking . what is it ? 
how did it go ? 
what 's the time ? 
you 've got such beautiful hands . 
i love you jack you know that . 
you sold the car . you got a job . what 's the third thing ? tell me . 
you were a croupier there ? you never told me that . i thought you just knew some gamblers . 
450 ? what did you do just walked in and said i want to be a croupier ? do n't you need training ? 
how did you land that ? 
what job ? 
i want to hear it . 
you 're my prisoner . 
of course they will . you just have to be patient . i 'm betting on you . 
take it back . till you sell your book . 
you should n't have done that . i know what it meant to you . 
where did you get it ? 
it 's not just inner beauty is it ? 
i wo n't be that long . 
no no . i 'm not ready for you . there 's some vodka in the freezer . 
i could n't resist them . 
yes . i 'm all over that now . jack hold on a minute . there 's someone here who wants to talk to you ... 
great . i 'm getting married . at least i think i am . 
sun city . i 've been meaning to call you for months . 
jack ! it 's jani . 
it 's a shame there are n't more men in the world like you . 
would you like a drink ? 
i took the bandage off yesterday . 
bruise ?   oh yes . it 's better . 
the date 's not set yet . i 'll call you . one last thing : the man you 're going to catch cheating he may get violent . but you know how to deal with cheats . 
do you ? 
well life 's not fair . we know that . 
thank you . 
is it yes ? 
i have to take the car . 
i 'm sorry . 
i told you all bets are off . 
let it go . 
no forget it . the bet 's off . 
i want you to forget what i said . 
i 'm asking you as a ... friend . you 'd be saving the life of a friend . 
i want to go back to cape town i want to start again clean . 
next time it 'll be my neck . 
these people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after . they want someone they can be sure of an honest dealer . that 's the point . not all dealers are honest . mr reynolds will never suspect you . 
you keep the ten thousand pounds . 
it wo n't . 
i 've come to know you . you 're honest .   i trust you . 
you wo n't be committing a crime . the man will cheat you 'll just be doing your job that 's all . 
you do n't have to be criminal . a man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat . you 'll see him stop him and the guy will make a big scene . there 'll be chaos . and that 's when it 'll happen . 
just listen . you do n't have to do anything criminal . 
the point is they want a man inside . 
my creditors . one night around three in the morning they 'll come into the casino - 
they mean it . 
some people i know they 're planning to rob the golden lion . 
i know that . but you can now . 
i owe a lot of money . 
i 'm in trouble . 
i did n't . 
that trick tonight i do n't think i 've ever seen that before . 
which side do you like ? 
you do n't like cheats do you . 
what happened ? 
he does n't gamble . 
that 's fine . 
just an accident . nothing . 
toss you for it . 
i 'm not married . i wear it to keep the flies off .   i must go . let me pay for this . 
do you believe in astrology ? 
that 's africa . there 's an african in all of us is n't there ? 
and the lies . gamblers are born liars . 
i loved the atmosphere . but it destroyed my poor mother . 
now there 's a coincidence . my father used to gamble there . 
near the casino . 
no no . i come every couple of years . i always think i 'm going to stay . i 'm from cape town originally 
i was at a loose end . a friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership . 
i 'm not much of a gambler really . i just like this bar . 
to coincidence . 
that 's stupid . what are the odds of you being seen with me ? 
you know what ? i 'd like to buy you a drink . 
well thank you anyway . 
you know where i 'm from ? 
and when the fog lifted there 's darren with his head under justine 's skirt . 
she was there ... 
'cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend ?   who would take offense to that ? 
you mean until you showed up ? 
i say hang the bastard out to dry let her see him for the heel he is then maybe she 'll step to the all - girl team and let mama - licious ease her pain . 
only one i can think of . 
so are dogs . 
friends do n't help other friends cheat . 
you 're actually gon na bail sketchy out . 
more like a mystery ... which is n't bad . it 's just kinduv ... mysterious ... 
and back at ya .   only there 's a part of you that 's ... i do n't know-- 
long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book right ? 
how long you and me known each other ? 
you know what i 'm saying . 
hell yeah .   there 's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying .   you are a totally down - ass female and a straight - up friend who happens to be a little ... 
he was just trying to blame you 'cause he 's a slut . 
you 're not seriously buying into darren 's nonsense . 
you 're way more philosophical than i could ever be . 
craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him . 
shame wastin ' a girl like that on a guy but what 're you gon na do ? 
now why ca n't i find a girlfriend like that ?   brings him lunch everyday thoughtful sweet legs from here to there-- 
no but i broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day know what i 'm saying ? 
caught some son - of - a - bitch stealing my bike .   used a car jack to blow out my u lock and bent a bunch of spokes .   so now i got ta get my wheels fixed . 
i understand . 
okay okay . 
help ... lemme go ... no do n't let me go ... help ... 
let go of my hand . 
not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch .   i decide when i 'm done with your boyfriend .   not him and certainly not you .   unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are . 
you 're also a fool . 
how sweet .   standing by your man even after what he did .   you 're a very understanding person . 
i thought it was important for you to know the facts . 
he been sleeping in a t - shirt lately ?   that 's so you wo n't see the fingernail marks on his back .   bet you did n't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting .   he did n't either ... at first . 
with me where he 's been after work three sometimes four nights a week for the last two months ... we have what you might call an intimate relationship . 
my name 's lydia .   and it seems you and i have a lot in common . 
to set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late . 
a friend of your fiance 's . 
what was his name ? 
what happened ? 
hi ... what 's going on here ? 
is that a cellar door ? 
who 's frank ? 
why ? is this about the book ? 
where are we going ? 
i 'm so scared ... i just keep thinking that something awful has happened . it 's my fucking stepdad . i know it . 
yeah they told me to get out of the house . 
i do n't know . she did n't leave a note . the house is all messed up . 
my mom is gone . 
not now donnie . it is n't a good time . 
what 's wrong with you ? 
what ? how long was i asleep ? 
and inside these glasses are these slide photographs . and each photograph is of something peaceful ... or beautiful . whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside . 
infant memory generators . 
maybe she 's asleep . 
are you okay ? 
yeah . and right now there 's some fat guy over there watching us . 
no ... donnie wait . i 've never ... 
you want to kiss me ... 
and what ? 
like ... a hawaiian sunset ... the grand canyon . things that remind you how beautiful the world can be . 
that 's not good enough . you 've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them ... with whatever you wanted . 
babies cry because they 're afraid of the dark . and because they have no memories ... for all they know ... every night could be the last forever . like perpetual darkness . 
what happened to your neck ? 
well ... maybe someone is like ... giving you these dream steroids . and sleepwalking ... is someone showing you the way . 
do you ever feel as though there 's always someone watching you ? 
and you 'd never been there before ? 
so when you sleepwalk you go somewhere familiar ? 
my dad said never wake a sleepwalker ... because they could drop dead . 
so when you sleepwalk can you remember afterward ? like do you dream ? 
i 'm going home . 
where are we going ? 
that was a compliment . 
you 're weird . 
why is that ? 
until it withers away . 
wonder where we 'll be then . 
you mean soap ? 
i should go . for physics . monnitoff says i have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind . 
donnie darko is a cool name . sounds like a superhero . 
he fled . they still ca n't find him .   my mom and i had to change our names and stuff . i thought gretchen sounded kind of cool . 
he stabbed my mom four times in the chest . 
yeah . my parents got divorced . my mom has a restraining order against my stepdad .   he has ... emotional problems . 
fuck them . 
do n't look so freaked .

i 've always thought that myself . 
and here is one of frederick 's mother . 
one or two ? 
mr. merrick sugar ? 
oh frederick . 
frederick just what is it that you are saying ? 
oh that 's absurd frederick . no no frederick that 's all wrong ! john is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life . and that is completely due to you . 
oh freddie . what could that wretched vampire say to upset you ? 
... freddie ! what 's the matter ? you 've been like this all evening . 
more romances for john ? 
dinner will be served shortly dear . 
and here are my mother and father . 
do you ? 
well these things take time . 
i 'm sure i do n't know freddie . 
perhaps you 're just polishing a stone endowing this elephant man with qualities he does n't possess ? 
frederick why are you so interested in this particular case ? 
but i thought you said that he was rather ... simple ? 
what do you mean ? 
freddie ? ... freddie do n't look so discouraged . 
yes and they send their kisses . would you like your sherry now ? 
did it go well darling ? 
you wo n't be long ? 
welcome home john . 
a dressing bag ? 
very smart indeed . 
yes sir .   what 's that ? 
mr. treves some more books arrived for mr. merrick . 
i bathed him did n't i ? i fed him and cleaned up after him ! if loving kindness can be called care and practical concern then yes i did treat him with loving kindness and i 'm not ashamed to say it . 
but you saw them sir . they could n't hide their disgust . they do n't care anything for john they 're just trying to impress their friends . 
i ca n't understand why you let those people go in there sir . 
excuse me sir . i 'd like to have a word with you . 
watery headed bunch . 
parrots can do as much mr. treves . it 's all very nice but i do n't see the point . you know they wo n't let him stay here . 
good lord mr. treves ! 
perhaps you 've got the time for that mr. treves i certainly do n't . i 've got an entire hospital to look after and you have your real patients . do n't waste your time with him sir it 's like talking to a wall . i do n't mean to be harsh but truthfully what can you do for him ? i 'll be back later for his bath . and mr. carr gomm would like to see you when you have a moment . good day sir . 
just being obstinate sir . i 'll handle it . 
wo n't come out eh ? 
good morning mr. treves . it 'll be his bath - time soon . has he eaten ? 
the workhouse . 
sir you do n't have to worry about me . i 'm not the sort to cry out . shall we go in ? 
i 've heard . 
it 's sinking ! hy - brasil is sinking ! 
but father it is ! 
it 's your fantasy ... 
there is no magic father ... my mother had no magic ... 
it 's all in your own mind father ... it 's you who imagine that i 'm always up here with some man or other .... 
you 're losing your temper ! 
there 's nobody here father . look for yourself . 
there is no one . 
who father ? 
ah ! it 's my father ! 
i do n't want to live without you . 
then i shall come too . 
no living man has ever set foot in the halls of asgaard ... the gods will never let you return . 
blow the third note ! the note to take us home ! 
erik ! you 've done what you came to do ! 
the second note . 
then let go ! 
you do n't have to love me . just : do you believe i love you ? 
do you believe i love you ? 
you still want to go to asgaard ? 
no . do n't look ... the abyss will suck away your strength . 
no ! no ! we are in the spell of the horn ! hatred will destroy us . 
no ! wait ! erik ! the cloak ! the cloak invisible ! it only seems to work on my father ! 
but you do n't realize .... 
erik . you do n't understand . 
i mean you could have killed yourself . 
but erik ... 
you 're as bad as my father . 
that 's just what i was trying to tell you . you are ... 
oh for goodness ' sake ! 
the cloak invisible . it was my mother 's parting gift . 
i 've never loved anybody ! 
why do you go on about that ? what does it matter ? 
but you loved her all the same ... 
what was she like ? 
what does that matter ? but you 've ... you 've ... felt like this before ... 
no i mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you 'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart ... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be your goals ... whose dreams seem to be your dreams ? 
no of course not silly -- i mean felt like this about them ? 
have you ever felt like this about anyone else ? 
but surely you know ... ? 
put them down !   please make them put them down . 
please ! you do n't know what you 're doing ! 
those things in your hands . 
please ! please ! what are those ? 
well everyone is friends here on hy- brasil . 
well of course . we always welcome friends . 
i said welcome . 
why should you care ? 
you 'll have to wait till he 's finished his game . 
have you tried to ask the god for anything ? 
what 's the point of being dead in the land of the living ? 
what a stupid idea . 
why ... should you care ? 
i dunno ... you looked so ... so vulnerable ... 
oh that 's all right then ... it 's the thought ... that counts ... 
thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death . 
aaagh ! rape ! 
and i was just saying that rape is no more pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on . 
well you started it . 
but that 's a circular argument ! if the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition they cancel each other out . 
why ? why have you got to go round killing and looting ? 
what about the killing and looting ? that 's just as crude is n't it ? 
you don't like it do you ? 
about raping me ? 
what d'you expect ? you come in here burn my village kill my family and try to rape me ... 
oh get it over with . 
what -- rape ? 
you do n't love me . 
it 's obvious you have n't raped anyone in your life . 
what about the raping ? 
looting and pillaging eh ? 
have you done this sort of thing before ? 
hi joel . so no jokes about my name ? 
you did ? you liked me ? 
but i do n't know maybe we 're the normal ones y'know ? i mean what kind of people do well at this stuff ? 
anyhoo sweetie i done a bad thing . i kinda sorta wrecked your car ... 
okay i guess . 
yeah hi i have a one o'clock with dr. mierzwiak . clementine kruczynski . 
what 's wrong with me ? 
it 's gorgeous .   just my taste . i 've never   gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry i liked .   thanks . so let 's get going . long drive . 
i 'm so excited . yay ! 
yay ! it 'll be great ! i 'll get my shit . 
now . now ! i have to go now . i have to see the frozen charles ! now ! tonight ! 
come up to boston with me ? 
nothing makes any sense . nothing makes any sense . 
i do n't know . i 'm lost . i 'm scared . i feel like i 'm disappearing . i 'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me . 
in the room ? 
you rat . 
come over after i 'm done here ? 
you were not . 
maybe gay is n't the right word . but anyway it 's been rough with him ... whatever the fuck he is . heheh . my significant other ... heh heh . and i guess on a certain level i want to break it off but i feel ... y'know ... it 's like this constant questioning and re questioning . do i end it ? should i give it more time ? i 'm not happy but what do i expect ? relationships require work . you know the drill . the thing that i keep coming back to is i 'm not getting any younger i want to have a baby ... at some point ... maybe ... right ? so then i think i should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- i mean he 's a good guy . it 's not really settling . then i think maybe i 'm just a victim of movies y'know ? that i have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be . but then i think no this is what i really want so i should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it . you know ? agreed ? but then i think he is a good guy and ... it 's complicated . y'know ? 
what ? no . i do n't like the term boyfriend . it 's so gay . 
well i 've been having a bad time of it with um my boyfriend i guess . 
okay i guess . 
i just wanted to say that . come by my house . 
yay . meet me after work by the old mill . 
we should have sex . it 's old hat for us . 
says you were constantly calling me a slob .   it 's sexy that we were like a married couple griping and overly - familiar and bored . do n't you think ? 
does n't sound like me . 
well sounds like me . sorry man .   says you were jealous and suspicious . 
a bully ? moi ? 
says you were closed off non communicative never told me what you were feeling . 
well you obviously do n't know me . 
i 'm nervous too . 
hey joel -- 
that 's okay . i -- 
oh um ... 
make love ? 
joel come here . please . 
what if ? 
do n't worry . it 's really solid this time of year . 
tonight . just to test out the phone lines . 
so you 'll call me right ? 
bye joel . 
come back and make up a good - bye at least . let 's pretend we had one . 
what if you stay this time ? 
so go . 
no it 's our house ! just tonight --   -- we 're david and ruth laskin . which one do you want to be ? i prefer to be ruth but i 'm flexible .   alcohol ! you make drinks . i 'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more ruth . i 'm ruthless at the moment . 
ah - ha ! now i can look for candles matches and the liquor cabinet . 
yeah . what 's your girlfriend 's name ? 
i knew by your nervousness that naomi was n't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass . 
i could see you wanted to come in joel . 
c'm on man . the water 's fine . nobody 's coming here tonight believe me . this place is closed up . electricity 's off . 
it 's freezing out here . 
at least i have n't been barking up the wrong tree . 
male or female ? 
let 's move into this neighborhood . 
i wish we did . you married ? 
yes ! i love that poem . it breaks my heart . i 'm so excited you know it .   look houses in which we do n't live . 
yeah maybe . 
i think before . 
me too . there 's this poem -- 
really ? me too ! i do n't meet people who even know who she is and i work in a book store . 
have you ever read any anna akhmatova ? 
i 'll give you a couple . see what you think . 
you should try xanax . i mean it 's a chemical and all but it works ... and it works just having it around knowing that it 's there . like insurance . 
but my sleeping is really fucked up . 
no i stopped . i did n't want to feel like i was being artificially modulated . 
what do we do ? 
this is it joel . it 's gon na be gone soon . 
yeah like that . 
oh god how horrid . 
i 'm clementine . can i borrow a piece of your chicken ? 
yeah i know . i 'm fishing . 
i ca n't tell you how happy i am to hear that . i mean i do n't mean i 'm happy you 're uncomfortable but yknow ... i 'm such a loser . every time i come to a party i tell myself i 'm going to be different and it 's always exactly the same and then i hate myself after for being such a clod . 
i saw you sitting over here . by yourself . i thought thank god someone normal who does n't know how interact at these things either . 
hi there . 
remember me . try your best . maybe we can . 
i know . 
i had you pegged did n't i ? 
joel i 'm not a concept . i want you to just keep that in your head . too many guys think i 'm a concept or i complete them or i 'm going to make them alive but i 'm just a fucked - up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind . do n't assign me yours . 
so make your domestic decisions and maybe we 'll talk again . 
look man i 'm telling you right off the bat i 'm high maintenance . so i 'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there . if you want to be with me you 're with me . 
well you 're married . 
i did n't think you 'd show your face around me again . i figured you were humiliated . you did run away after all . 
is that what you want ? 
yes exactly . exactly my point . 
come up and see me ... now . 
so what . infatuation is good too . 
but you were n't . i could tell . 
i said : are you sure ? you seem unsure . 
i 'll buy that . black 's always good . 
egad were you horrified ? 
what was i wearing ? 
naomi i guess . 
i love it ! 
thanks joely . a present ! oh boy ! 
look at you cutey ! what are we doing ? 
hide me somewhere deeper ? somewhere buried ? 
yes but i ca n't love a man named wally . 
but ca n't you see ... i love you antoine . 
gross ! you must remember to tell me this in the morning . i 'm like so freaked out now . 
really ? is he cute ? 
-- another rainy day . whatever shall we do ? 
you remember what happened next ? 
you know we 're okay . they 're not finding us . you 'll remember me in the morning . and you 'll come to me and tell me about us and we 'll start over . 
joel joely look ... it 's not fading . the memory . i think we 're hidden . 
i 'm right here . 
well ... if they 're looking for me in memories i 'm in what if you take me to a memory i 'm not in ?   and we can hide there till morning . 
what if you hide me ? 
wow . um well ... ca n't you just force yourself awake ? 
such a beautiful view . 
do you know the velveteen rabbit ? 
joel you 're a liar . 
i want to know you . 
you do n't tell me things joel . i 'm an open book . i tell you everything . every damn embarrassing thing . you do n't trust me . 
you 're a whiz kid . so perceptive so -- 
would you get me another joely ? 
it 's you ! it 's you who ca n't commit to anything ! you have no idea how lucky you are i 'm interested in you ! i do n't even know why i am ! i should just end it right here joel . leave you in the zoo . maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with ! 
i 'd make a fucking good mother ! i love children ! i 'm creative and smart and i 'd make a fucking good mother ! 
you ca n't fucking say something like that and say you do n't want to talk about it ! 
joel we 're fucking gon na talk about it ! 
what ? ! 
you 're not ready . 
no . i want to have a baby . i have to have a baby . 
i want to have a baby . 
i 'm fucking crawling out of my skin . 
how can you watch this crap ? 
fuck you joel . faggot . 
a wino ? jesus are you from the fifties ? a wino !   face it joel . you 're freaked out because i was out late without you and in your little wormy brain you 're trying to figure out did she fuck someone tonight ? 
oh christ i did n't kill anybody . it 's just a fucking dent . you 're like some old lady or something . 
... a little . i was a little tipsy . do n't call me pathetic . 
yo ho ho ! 
you did n't say anything about my hair . 
tonight . just to test out the phone lines and all . 
you 'll call me right ? 
i would like you to call me . would you do that ? i would like that . 
you should stay . 
i 'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and -- 
yeah ? oh great ! 
i do n't believe in that soulmate crap anymore but ... he says so many great things . we like the same writers . this writer stephen dixon he turned me on to . and he 's cute . it 's fucked up . joel you should come up to the charles with me sometime . 
exactly ! i used to do it in college and i had this urge to go do it again so i got patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me but i was really disappointment to be there with him . y'know ? and that 's where psychic stuff comes in . like it just is n't right with him . y'know ? 
that made me cry . but anyway we went up to boston because i had this urge to lie on my back on the charles river . it gets frozen this time of year . 
well for the last week anyway ! he 's kind of a kid . kind of a goofball but he 's really stuck on me which is flattering . who would n't like that ? and he 's like a dope but he says these smart and moving things sometimes out of nowhere that just break my heart . he 's the one who gave me that crow photograph . 
i do n't either . i used to . but i 'm through with that . y'know if i do n't love my body then i 'm just lost . you know ? with all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that 's coming ' round the bend .   so i 've been seeing this guy ... 
i 'm nervous . you do n't need to be nervous around me though . i like you . do you think i 'm repulsively fat ? 
you 're very nice . god i have to stop saying that . you 're nervous around me huh ? 
like i wanted to talk to you . i did n't need any more reason to do it . who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist ? 
what 's the goal joel ?   my goal joel is to just let it flow through me ? do you know what i mean ? it 's like there 's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and i think we 're all taught we should be consistent . y'know ? you love someone -- that 's it . forever . you choose to do something with your life -- that 's it that 's what you do . it 's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through . and my feeling is that 's how you die because you stop listening to what is true and what is true is constantly changing . you know ? 
and anyway you sell yourself short . i can tell . there 's a lot of stuff going on in your brain . i can tell . my goal ... can i tell you my goal ? 
i like you . that 's the thing about my psychic thing . i think that 's my greatest psychic power that i get a sense about people . my problem is i never trust it . but i get it . and with you i get that you 're a really good guy . 
you 're really nice . i 'm sorry i yelled at you before about it . god i 'm an idiot . 
oh .   does that make you sad ? or anxious ? i 'm always anxious thinking i 'm not living my life to the fullest y'know ? taking advantage of every possibility ? just making sure that i 'm not wasting one second of the little time i have . 
it 's helpful to think there 's some order to things . you 're kind of closed mouthed are n't you ? 
but i think i am . i like to think i am . 
exactly . exactly ! that 's exactly my feeling about it . it 's hard to know . like okay but how many times do i think something and it does n't happen ? that 's what you 're saying right ? you forget about those times . right ? 
me neither . but sometimes i have premonitions so i do n't know . maybe that 's just coincidence . right ? y'know you think something and then it happens or you think a word and then someone says it ? y'know ? 
well i go to a psychic and she 's always telling me i 'm psychic . she should know . do you believe in that stuff ? 
y'know i 'm sort of psychic . 
drink up young man . it 'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant . 
i know a man who needs a refill . 
no stay . just for a little while .   refill ? 
i do n't know ! i ca n't see them from here joel ! just pick something good . 
you pick it . 
ready for another ? 
yeah ? well have a seat anyway . 
god that feels so fucking good . take yours off . 
i miss grade school . i do n't know why i 'm calling it grade school all of a sudden . when i went we called it elementary school . but i like grade school better . sounds like something someone from the forties would call it . i 'd like to be from then . everyone wore hats . anyway cheers ! 
yeah . i 'm not like a robert frost lover by any stretch . his stuff seems strictly grade school to me . but this made me cry for some reason . maybe because it is grade school . y'know ? 
me neither . oh there 's an inscription on the back .   the way a crow / shook down on me / the dust of snow / from a hemlock tree / has given my heart / a change of mood / and saved some part / of a day i rued . 
do you believe in that stuff ? reincarnation ? 
this ... someone gave that to me just like recently . i like it too . i like crows . i think i used to be a crow . 
you like that ? 
never mind . sorry that was stupid . i 'm embarrassed . good night joel . 
hey do you want to have a drink ? i have lots of drinks . and i could -- 
oh geez i 'm full of shit . i already told you that .   anyway . see ya . 
thanks very much . that was very nice of you . 
me too . it is rain dogs by the way . 
so you like bookstores huh ? 
look i 'm very sorry i came off sort of nutso . i 'm not really . 
wilmont . near the high school . 
you know wilmont ? 
you ca n't be too careful . i 've been stalked . i 've been told i 'm highly stalkable . i do n't need that . 
you 're not a stalker or anything right ? 
i do n't want to take you out of your way . 
no that 's okay . thanks though . 
unless i get that hair - color - naming job . 
oh okay . well sure i 'll just ...   take care then . 
i 'm sorry i ... yelled at you . was it yelling ? i ca n't really tell . whatever i 'm a little out of sorts today . 
joel ? it 's joel right ? 
shit . shit . i know it 's here . hold on . 
i do n't need nice . i do n't need myself to be it and i do n't need anyone else to be it at me . 
now i 'm nice ? do n't you know any other adjectives ? there 's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative ... mumpish . 
why would n't you think that about me ? 
yeah . although it hardly fits . i 'm a vindictive little bitch truth be told . 
oh my darlin ' oh my darlin ' oh my darlin ' clementine ? no ? 
huckleberry hound ! what are you nuts ? 
huckleberry hound ? 
no jokes about my name ? oh you would n't do that ; you 're trying to be nice . 
my name 's clementine by the way . 
yeah i got it . 
well you do n't know me so ... you do n't know do you ? 
i think . anyway i 've tried all their colors . more than once . i 'm getting too old for this . but it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality . i apply my personality in a paste . you ? 
my writing career ! your hair written by clementine kruczynski .   the tom waits album is rain dogs . 
someone 's got that job .   agent orange ! i came up with that one . anyway there are endless color possibilities and i 'd be great at it . 
purple haze pink eraser . 
anyway this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names . red menace yellow fever green revolution . that 'd be a job coming up with those names . how do you get a job like that ? that 's what i 'll do . fuck the dole . 
exactly ! tom waits . which song ? 
blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering . 
ah the hair .   blue right ? it 's called blue ruin . the color . snappy name huh ? 
i 'll go on the dole . like my daddy before me . 
well i 'm there . i hide in the back as much as is humanly possible . you have a cell phone ? i need to quit right this minute . i 'll call in dead . 
jesus is it five years ? i got ta quit right now . 
ucch really ? you 're kidding . god . bizarre small world huh ? yeah that 's me : book slave there for like five years now . 
get out ! me too ! what are the odds ? 
just you know to chat a little maybe . i have a long trip ahead of me .   how far are you going ? on the train i mean of course . 
no i do n't want to bug you if you 're trying to -- 
oh . so ... 
it 's okay if i sit closer ? so i do n't have to scream . not that i do n't need to scream sometimes believe me .   but i do n't want to bug you if you 're trying to write or something . 
aw c'm on live dangerously . take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car . 
why are you sorry ? i just said hi . 
here we are . 
how are you today ? 
ms. kruczynski ? 
yes please have a seat . he 'll be right with you . 
may i help you ? 
i think he 'll be in bartlett 's one day . 
i like to read what smart people say . so many beautiful important things . 
i love quotes . so did winston churchill . he actually has a quotation in bartlett 's about bartlett 's . is n't that trippy ? 
oh patrick you did n't want any did you ? 
oh hey patrick . 
remember the alamo ! remember the alamo ! 
i wo n't allow it . those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . what do you think of that ? that 's from my quote book . 
they have a right to know . howard is a thief . he steals the truth .   i ca n't remember my baby ! i ca n't remember my baby . it existed and i ca n't even remember . do you understand that ? 
then why did you ask me ? 
what do you want stan ? 
thanks stan . 
do you remember anything else ? what i was wearing ? was i standing close to him ? was i leaning against his car like i owned it ? how did he look at me when i giggled ? tell me everything . 
and after that ? 
how did i look ? 
and you never even suspected ? never saw us behaving in any unusual way together ? 
do you swear you did n't know ? 
hell no . 
he 's coming ? 
this guy 's only half cooked . there 's no time to fuck around stan . 
sor - ry   we have to do something . he ca n't wake up half done . 
well what should we do ? 
to let people begin again . it 's beautiful . you look at a baby and it 's so fresh so clean so free . and adults ... they 're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness ... hopelessness . and howard just makes it go away . 
it 's amazing is n't it ? such a gift howard gave the world . 
let him go stan . i can help . 
do n't you think howard 's like that ? smart ? important ? 
yeah i ca n't wait to tell howard ! it seems really appropriate . 
nietzsche . beyond good and evil . found it my bartletts . 
well allow me to do the honors . it 's fucking freezing and i need something . 
yeah .   poor guy .   have anything to drink ? 
it 's freezing out . 
i better do this stan . 
' kay . 
anyway i 've got to do my tap dance here . 
it 's just ... y'know ... i mean ... 
stan ... c'm on ... 
you made me have you erased ! i loved you . i love you ! how could you -- 
you made me have an abortion . 
thanks .   so ... do we talk about this ... or what ? 
what howard ? 
no you 're right . once again . you 're a decent man howard . 
i wish i was your wife . i wish i had your kids . 
i 've loved you for a very long time . i 'm sorry ! i should n't have said that . 
okay . good . great . thanks .   i like you howard ... an awful lot . is that terrible ? 
really ? i thought it was appropriate maybe . that 's all .   i really admire the work that you do . i know it 's not proper to be so familiar but i guess since we 're outside the workplace i feel a certain liberty to -- 
you are such a sweetheart . 
yes shit . oops sorry !   sorry . it 's just i told myself i was n't going to say pope alexander and sound like a dope and then i go ahead and do it . like i psyched myself out . 
there 's another one i like i read . it 's by pope alexander . 
yeah yeah it is howard . and here i was thinking i could tell you something you did n't know . 
oh um like famous quotes . i find reading them inspirational to me . and in my reading i 've come across some i thought you might like too . 
do you like quotes howard ? 
that was beautiful to watch howard . like a surgeon or a concert pianist . 
welcome howard . 
cole slaw ice tea ? 
howard your one o'clock . 
' night . 
so i 'm going to get some sleep . i 'm glad you 're okay . 
okay joel . i suppose you 're right . 
i do n't know . i 'm not sure there 's a big public demand for books on calvinism and misogyny . 
i 'm glad you called . 
a religion instructor at columbia . a good guy . he 's a good guy . 
miss you too .   i have been seeing someone for a little while . 
oh sweetie . it really does cut both ways . we were taking each other for granted and -- 
i 'm sorry . 
so ... you have n't been involved with anyone in all this time ? 
say hi to rob and carrie . have some fun ! 
i 've got to finish this chapter anyway . 
yeah . come to bed . i 'm cold . 
hi rob and carrie . 
how was it ? 
the thing is joel whatever it is you think you have with this chick once the thrill wears off you 're just going to be joel with the same fucking problems . 
bullshit . who is it ? you met someone . 
so what 's going on joel ? 
do n't do this to me now joel . really . 
how am i going to be the progenitor of a tribe when i 'm living on an isolated ridgetop with delores ? 
well if the clock people give you any inside information on the end of the world drop us a postcard . 
but that 's an old story now ...... i ca n't believe that you would leave the butte . 
she had a one way - ticket to kansas city . 
the countess has come to our aid . the rubber rose ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls . and i have been asked to oversee the ranch . for $ 300 a week . and as it turns out the countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was ... here 's a picture ! 
is everything getting worse ? 
what do you believe in then ? 
then if you are japanese then why are you called the chink ? 
the clock people ? 
siwash huh ? 
what was that ? 
but i do n't know how to polka . 
oh ? well there 's been some trouble on the ranch . i came up here to get out of the way . it 's so dark now i doubt if i could find my way back down . if you could help ... 
i 'm a friend of bonanza jellybean 's . 
where are the others ? 
you might say that although i do n't think of it as traveling . 
well no i do n't reside anywhere in particular . i just keep moving . 
i do n't . 
i 'm staying with the countess . 
if i flinch when you say you love me it 's both our problems . my confusion becomes your confusion . students confuse teachers patients confuse psychiatrists lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts .... 
but the peyote is obviously affecting their brains . it 's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years . 
no i guess not . 
how did this business get started anyhow ? why are the birds nesting here ? 
so be it . it looks serious this time though . all these guns ... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes ? 
that 's jellybean ! 
you do n't agree with debbie then ? 
what is debbie 's position ? 
really ? the chink huh ? i 've gathered that you sometimes speak with him . what else have you learned from the chink ? 
you 're political then ? 
about being a cowgirl . what 's it all about ? when you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl . 
tell me about it . 
no i 'm afraid that part is n't true . jack was in awe of me and tracked me down . we spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field but he was hardly my lover . besides i always travel alone . 
er you seem to know who i am and maybe even what i am . thanks for the breakfast . 
my thumbs hurt . i 've made a mistake . i 've been negligent . i have n't exercised . i have to hitchhike a little bit every day no matter what . it 's like a musician practicing his scales . when i do n't practice my timing gets off my thumbs get stiff and sore . 
i have to go julian . 
getting dressed . i 've got to go . 
it 's not the air conditioner that 's making me cold . nothing moves in here . not even your birds . 
i 'm cold . 
as i developed however i grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style . time in terms of m.p.h. no longer interested me . i began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time : slow ancient vast . when i am really moving stopping car after car after car moving so freely so clearly so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass then i embody the rhythms of the universe . i am in a state of grace . 
when i was younger i hitchhiked one hundred and twenty - seven hours without stopping without food or sleep crossed the continent twice in six days cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways . 
i 'm the best . 
i was the yoni yum feminine - hygiene dew girl from 1965 to 1970 but got laid off . 
i was a successful model once . 
american cheese . the king of road food . 
going north ? 
i do n't know anything about it . 
well okay . i 'll try it . i do n't see the point in it but i 'll try it . just for you . it 's kind of silly actually me going out with an artist in new york city . however ... 
what makes you think this watercolorist and i would develop a romantic relationship ? 
why yes technically . jack kerouac and i came awfully close but he was afraid of me i think ... 
but countess ... 
if you do n't want me to pose for him why do you want me to meet him ? 
the food and drug administration said wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters burns and rashes . although the fda judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings . 
a job for me ? 
your ranch ? 
bonanza jellybean ? 
does that mean you might have an assignment for me ? 
i 've always been proud of the way nature singled me out . it 's the people who have been deformed by society i feel sorry for . i 've been steady moving for eleven years and some months . maybe i should rest up for a spell i 'm not as young as i used to be . 
a born freak can only go uphill . 
every time i tell you that i love you you flinch . but that 's your problem . 
' drugged ' is a stupid word . 
hell no the cranes are wonderful okay but i 'm not in this for whooping cranes . i 'm in it for cowgirls . if we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue then cowgirls become just another compromise . i want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl . better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised . 
looks like every time we get together things are in a mess . 
from men the whooping crane has received neither love nor respect . men have drained the crane 's marshes stolen its eggs invaded its privacy polluted its food fouled its air blown it apart with buckshot . 
i would n't say that . i expect she 's right ultimately . but i 'm with delores when it comes to fighting for what 's mine . i ca n't understand why delores is so uptight about the chink ; he could probably teach her a thing or two . ee ! that grass tickles does n't it ? god knows i love women but nothing can take the place of a man that fits . still this is cowgirl territory and i 'll stand with delores and fight any bastards who might deny it . i guess i 've always been a scrapper . look . this scar . only twelve years old and i was felled by a silver bullet . 
debbie says that if women are to take charge again they must do it in the feminine way ; they must n't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods . she says it is up to women to show themselves better than men to love men set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the new age . she 's a real dreamer that debbie - dear . 
...... delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week but so far her third vision has n't happened . niwetükame the mother goddess has not gotten back in touch with her . meanwhile she and debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools . tension . cowgirl tension ! what a drag . 
learned from the chink ? oh my . ha ha . that 's hard to say . we mostly .... uh a lot of his talk is pretty goofy . 
did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth ? it 's not original . it 's something i picked up from the chink . 
cowgirls exist as an image . a fairly common image . the idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture . therefore it seems to me the existence of cowgirls should prevail . otherwise they 're being fooled . in the rodeo hall of fame in oklahoma city there are just two cowgirls . two . and both of 'em are trick - riders . trick - riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos . our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks . that 's what prostitutes call it you know : ' tricking . ' 
well that does n't matter ; that part never interested me anyway . the beatnicks were before my time and i never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope clichés and the clap . but the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl . 
oh i know about sissy hankshaw all right . i 've done a little hitchhiking myself . ah shucks that 's like telling annie oakley you 're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone . i 'd heard tales about you from people i 'd meet in jail cells and truckstops . i heard about your uh your ah your wonderful thumbs and i heard how you were jack kerouac 's girl friend ... 
welcome podner . by god it 's great to have you here . it 's an honor . sorry i took so long getting to you but we 've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do . 
i do n't know the process dr. weir was the expert ... 
there must be a way ! what about engineering ? 
you 're okay now it 's over ... 
i do n't know the screens are dead ... ! 
it is not . 
miller he 's back he was in the tank ... 
i 'll do it -- 
blow it up ? 
we 've got to shut it down we 've got to ... 
weir ca n't be alive . 
five seconds . 
you better hurry . he 's engaged the override we ca n't open the inner door . 
he 's awake he 's in the airlock he 's not wearing a suit . 
justin 's in the airlock . 
miller come in ... 
nine hours and twenty - two minutes . 
i thought you wanted an answer . and that 's the only one i have . 
i know that . 
it 's not bullshit it 's the only conclusion the data supports ... 
i did n't say that i said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you the ship is reacting to us ... 
you 've got to listen ... 
there was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you ... you saw what you saw . we picked up a similar readings right before the clarke was damaged . what if there were a connection between the two ? the gravity waves the hallucination all part of an defensive reaction like an immune system ... 
i 've got a theory . 
i thought of that with the filters from the clark we 've got enough breathable air for twenty hours . after that we 'd better be on our way home . 
it 's building up with every breath we take . and the co2 filters on the event horizon are shot . 
oxygen is not the problem . 
the antennae array 's completely fried we 've got no radio no laser no highgain ... no one 's going to be coming to help us . 
it tastes bad . 
we 're all here . 
that 's an affirmative . 
there 's not enough radiation to throw off the scan . i 'm picking up trace life forms but i ca n't get a lock on the location . 
something 's wrong with the bio - scan . 
crossing the horizon . optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees . 
i just finished drying ... 
ion drive will engage in ... t - minus ten minutes . 
we 're past the outer marker we can engage the ion drive whenever you 're ready . 
it 's cold . 
skipper justin just activated the door . it 's on a thirty second delay ... 
almost got it . 
keep him talking . 
he 's engaged the override . 
not according to the computer . 
miller smith cooper any of you in the airlock ? 
what is it ? 
in our current environment dr. weir self - control is an asset . 
what are you doing ? 
maybe a power interruption crashed the system ... 
i 'm sorry . 
it must be hard being so far away from her . 
claire is your wife ? 
why dr. weir i think you 're in love . 
i ca n't believe we built this . 
i do n't know . the life readings just went off the scale . 
what is it ? 
if they were in stasis i 'd get a location but these readings they 're all over the ship . it does n't make any sense . 
affirmative . the hull 's intact ... but there 's no gravity and the thermal units are off line . i 'm showing deep cold . the crew could n't survive unless they were in stasis . 
the reactor 's still hot . we 've got several small radiation sources leaks probably . nothing serious . 
a straight line . 
his peritoneum has ruptured ... 
90 over 50 and falling ... . 
i 've got a pulse he 's alive ... 
you did n't hear it ? you must have heard it ! 
what 's happening ... ? 
nothing . it 's nothing . 
what does ? 
what justin what shows you ? 
i 'll get back to the log . but on the bridge i wo n't go back back in there ... 
i can run the image through a series of filters try to clean it up . 
i can use the station in medical keep an eye on justin ... 
yeah . i 'm -- i 'm okay . 
i found one . 
everything 's been shut down . conserving power i guess . green light on the hull it 's intact . 
okay . i 'm on the bridge . 
there 's no one here skipper . 
i can see the hatch . 
i do n't know this place is really dark i ca n't see a thing ... 
that means they did n't abandon ship . 
jesus its huge . 
we 've got pressure . 
no no its alright . i talked to my ex he 'll keep denny over christmas and i 'll get him this summer .   goddam it skipper ... i have n't seen him in two months . 
just loading the last of the co2 scrubbers .   good for four months . 
i 've seen bodies before . this is different . 
about an hour ago . in medical . i saw my son . he was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were ... 
i did . 
there 's no one here . 
blood . looks like arterial spray . 
dr. weir what 's this the door to ? 
here 's another one . they 're all over the place . 
dj !   it 's okay . you 're okay . just breathe . 
they attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for titan . the shuttle 's oh - two tanks ruptured during the rescue flooded both ships with pure oxygen . there was a spark and both ships were incinerated . the skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat . captain miller was able ... 
he served on the goliath . 
do n't worry about it . he 's hard but he 's fair . you 're lucky to be shipping out with him . he 's one of the few captains in the service with experience in the outer reach . 
first time in a grav couch ? 
i do n't care . 
you got any coffee ? 
we have to do something oh god ... 
come on baby - bear open this door ... 
do you know what it was ? 
yes . yes justin we heard it . 
can you shut it down ? 
there 's no one in the corridor but us . 
where is reed ? 
no it 's not . i thought i was done waiting for reed ... we 're all in this together now ben . 
just give reed a little more time . you know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one -- 
he did n't mean it . you know johnny . he 's always been a hothead -- 
what did he do to the uniform ? ! 
he did n't . 
the suit will stretch . you should try it -- 
we need to give you a physical so we know what got zapped . 
i can only stay for one drink ben . i 've got to meet with victor . 
we can monitor the cloud 's approach and observe the tests from here . 
victor did . 
i 'll schedule the launch . call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew . 
but johnny ... you ca n't fly . 
what are you doing -- 
no i 'm sorry for pushing you out . 
as soon as you stop acting like one . come on you 're smarter than this . you think those people out there care about you ? you 're just a fad to them . 
johnny slow down . think . you know mom did n't raise us to -- 
johnny ? did you see ben ? 
you two need a time - out . 
i 'm driving . 
girl ... ? ! 
that 's the temperature of the sun . 
you were at 4000 kelvin . any hotter you 're approaching supernova -- 
grow up johnny . you want to run around on fire for the rest of your life ? 
i think that thing is ben . 
stop it . 
apparently i can disappear . 
the synthetics act as a second skin adapting to your individual needs to -- 
a gasket ? reed we 're at a party . 
i 'm sure i can come up with something . 
you need a doctor . 
reed stop you need to rest your -- 
that would have kinda defeated the purpose . and reed ...   i 'm saying it now . 
when i walked out i waited ten minutes outside your door . ten . waiting for you to come find me . 
i did . i did reed ... but i wanted you to be that man . 
i gave him twenty . 
of course i was . i 'd read all your papers on bioethics . some of them two times just so i 'd have something to say to you . 
remember our first date here ... ? god i was so nervous . 
reed . shh . just be quiet . and look up . 
every variable but yourself . you do n't eat sleep . you ca n't live in your head like -- 
better than your life . victor 's not the one who has to get into that thing . we are . 
do n't let victor push you into making a mistake -- 
reed . how close are we to a cure ? 
and you sure you can control this thing ? last time did n't work out so well . 
but we 're the focus right reed ? reed ... ? 
and reverse the mutations -- 
what are you doing ? 
no . there were n't . there was you . and me . no variables no math . it was actually the simplest thing in the world . but your head got in the way ... like it always does . 
i just wanted to share an apartment . what was so complicated about that ? 
reed . i was ready for the next step you were n't ergo i walked . 
are you kidding ? 
i 'm sorry i 'm sorry i did n't mean to do that ... you must think that was some kind of latent hostility or -- 
i 'm sure i can come up with something . 
anger . rage . frustration . 
excuse me ? 
what about you ? you have n't eaten in days . how come you 're never on this side of the microscope ? 
if it happened to him then it could ... 
how come ben ca n't turn it on and off like us ? 
what ... ?   oh . 
it has to be the cloud . it 's fundamentally altered our dna . 
what ? what do you mean you -- 
you are such a dork reed ... you never got it and never will unless it 's explained to you in quantum physics . 
which was ? 
you 're happy for me and victor . 
you always had a way with words .   i should be getting back . 
yes thanks . 
great minds think alike . 
well he 's welcome to ride shotgun but we already have a pilot on our payroll . you remember my brother johnny ... 
it 's been changed . 
right . that 's exactly what i meant . 
i was talking about us . working together . 
never better . 
victor we ca n't do anything until the research is ready . 
please do n't make this personal -- 
if these molecules are n't stable they could make us worse maybe even kill us . 
he 's working round the clock . but the data needs to be tested analyzed before -- 
victor wait slow down a second . i want you to know i appreciate everything you 've done for me but i just do n't -- 
you said it was urgent . 
i 'm sorry i did n't get a chance to -- 
victor your scar -- 
victor i 'm sorry i -- 
victor are you feeling alright ? 
you ca n't leave them out there . 
what are you doing ? 
uh victor i hope i have n't done something to make you think ... 
it 's been a good two years victor ... the company 's accomplished so much . 
i understand the business reasons . 
it 's just business . 
brad . please do n't tell mom and dad ... 
thanks a lot brad . i really appreciate it . 
yeah . this is it . i have some shopping to do . 
it 's just linda . and mark from school . 
maybe yes . maybe no . 
but your face did ! 
you are a virgin ! 
i do n't know . i was just curious . 
hey brad . are you still a virgin ? 
maybe you just need to give her some time . she 's so nice brad . everybody loves lisa . 
i 'm just guessing . 
why ? because she wo n't sleep with you ? 
you 're going to break up with lisa are n't you ? 
is everything okay at work ? 
it 's just some guy i met at swenson 's . you do n't know him . 
thanks for getting rid of those flowers . 
i 'll explain everything later . 
brad what would you say if i asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the cruising vessel and get rid of them at work ? 
brad ! have mom or dad seen this ? 
do n't strain yourself . 
your friends use the pool too . 
why ca n't you do it ? 
u.s. history . mr. hand . 
hi brad . 
get going . 
mike ! you have a mess on c-9 ! 
half . okay ?   seventy - five dollars . and a ride to the clinic . 
it 's already planned mike . it 's going to cost $ 150 at the free clinic . 
we 've got to get an abortion ? 
take that back . 
i know it 's yours . 
mike . i want you to know that i 'm pregnant . 
mike there 's something that 's been on my mind and i have to tell you about it . 
i 'm in a hurry too . i just thought i could say hi to you . 
i did n't see you this morning . 
i guess i did . 
what 's wrong ? 
i think we 're making a lot of noise . 
hey mike ? 
i want you to know that it 's your final decision if we should continue or not . 
how about both of us at the same time ? 
why do n't you take off your clothes mike ? 
so are you .   are you shaking ? 
he 's my friend too . 
are you really a virgin ? 
pick a suit . 
brad probably has some trunks you can borrow ... i 'm going to my room to change ! 
do you want to take a quick swim ? 
are n't you curious to see how your class picture turned out ? 
i guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon . are you going to get one ? 
sure . come on in . 
mark is a really nice boy ... 
sometimes i get a ride with my brother . but he usually works in the mornings and then drives to school himself . 
i ca n't wait until i can drive next year . i walk every day . it 's such a drag . 
o - kay you guys can come swimming . but you have to leave as soon as my mom gets home . okay ? 
oh really ? 
nice to meet you . 
hey -- doug stallworth ? it 's his loss . 
i ca n't believe it ! but what about doug ? 
dartmouth ? ! 
but what are you going to do ? 
not coming ? what happened ? 
where 's doug ? 
i want romance . 
you know linda . i 've finally figured it out . it 's not sex i want . anyone can have sex . 
another summer of working at swenson 's . 
do n't do anything linda . i 'd rather just forget about it . i do n't even like the guy . 
i paid for it and everything . 
then i called his house and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father . 
i really thought he would show up . i waited ... and waited ... and waited ... 
you did n't tell me that they can be so nice so great ... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they 're five years old . 
you know there 's one thing you did n't tell me about guys . 
i 'm not going to tell him . he 's an asshole . i hate him . 
it could be . i had a pregnancy test at the clinic . i 'll find out monday . i guess it was damone . 
what do you think it is ? 
i do n't know ... i just do n't feel right . 
i do n't know i 'm just so depressed . everything is just so ... depressing . 
god i do n't think so . better look in the house . 
i know . he hates to have to wear uniforms . 
i did n't ask for any help . did you linda ? 
what do you think ? 
what 's doug do in chicago ? 
how long does doug take ? 
listen to this ... it says ' most women derive pleasure from sex but they do n't have real orgasms . ' 
does that ever happen ? 
all right ! here 's another one . ' the most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first you climax first you and your mate climax together ? ' 
would n't penis and balls be the same category ? 
listen to this ... ' what are your mate 's three most erogenous zones ? ' 
you really ought to look at this linda . there 's a drawing on every page ... and all these quizzes . it 's like school . 
what do you think of that guy who works at the theatre ? you know mark ratner . 
thanks a lot . 
i should quit this job . i 'm going to get so fat working here ... nobody will ever take me out . 
do n't you think it meant anything to him . even if i am fifteen ? 
not since november . 
i think christmas brings out the worst in people . 
if he ever calls again i 'll say i 'm eighteen . 
does doug care that you 're seventeen ? 
there ... there 's his car . i know he 's at work tonight . he has n't come into swenson 's since he called my house . my mother told him i was still at high school after i told him i was nineteen . i guess i should tell him i 'm fifteen . 
come on linda . it 's just sex . 
it was nice . 
it was okay . 
oh ! that 's where that group got its name from . 
well i never did it . 
like you know giving blow jobs . 
no there are variables that like i might not be good at . 
yeah but they look more sophisticated . you 'd probably think they 'd be better in bed . 
do you think guys find that attractive ? 
linda . that girl looks just like pat benatar . 
no way ! he just called him a dick . 
i ca n't believe i start high school tomorrow . 
he was hot was n't he ? 
i ca n't do that . 
so what did you do ? 
come on linda i have n't had a boyfriend all summer . you promised when i started working at the mall that my life would change ... do you think he 'll call this week ? 
he gave me his card .   ' ron johnson audio consultant . ' 
what should i do ? 
yeah but i fucked up . you can take it . really . 
do you think that guy 's cute ? 
what about those other guys you live with ? 
yes ... i am really nineteen . 
it is . it 's very warm . i wonder how long it will last ? 
that 's a nice shirt . 
the point sounds fine . 
i do n't know . wherever you want . 
thanks . so do you . 
thanks for picking me up . 
what can i get for you tonight . 
i know everyone says that . 
i 'd like that . 
yeah . i want you to have this picture so you wo n't forget what i look like . and so you 'll remember to call me over the summer . 
i know everybody says it but i really mean it . 
i 'm fine . mark i 'm so glad you came over here because i want you to know something . i just thought i would tell you that i really enjoyed getting to know you this year . 
hi mark . 
what about the notes ? 
i made a fool of myself . 
oh . i see . 
john bonham ? 
what 's april 16th ? 
where 's mike today ? 
do you really have to go ? 
this is me in the eighth grade . did you have mr. deegan ? 
do you want to see some pictures ? i kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high . how stupid right ? 
thanks . so ...   what do you want to do ? 
well i 'm going to change real quick . i hope you do n't mind . 
i do n't know . probably out . want something to drink ? 
no they 're away for the weekend . brad and i are watching the house . 
do you want to come inside ? 
me too . i 'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck . 
sure . i 'll ... have another coke . 
not at all . 
are you all right ? 
i think i 'll have the seafood salad special . 
i 've heard that too . 
yeah . she is pretty good . 
do you have mrs. george for english ? 
this is a nice car . 
thanks for coming to get me . 
do you have a pen ? this one 's out of ink . 
what 's your other question ? 
we keep them in case the people come back . 
we keep them . 
and do n't let them talk you into a diaphragm either . 
not if you 're over sixteen . 
all right what you want to do is go to the free clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need nornel one plus fifty 's . 
there 's a world of guys out there . i just wish i did n't have to date any of them . 
i did n't tell anyone i applied cause i never thought i 'd make it . 
well i might go to dartmouth . 
yeah like maybe never . 
he says he 's got to stay in chicago .   he says i should visit him sometimes . 
he 's not coming . 
romance in ridgemont ? we do n't even get cable tv . 
what do you want ? 
come on . there 's lots of men around here . keep your eyes open . 
stacy he 's not a guy .   he 's a little prick ! 
there goes your stereo for another year . mike damone is a no - brain little prick . i 'm not letting him get away with this . 
that little prick . 
that little prick . 
you 're right . i did n't tell you that . 
but it costs money to have an abortion . even at the free clinic . you tell damone to pay for it . it 's the least he can do . it 's the guy 's responsibility too . 
of course it was damone . if it was ron johnson you 'd be out to here ! 
it could n't be . 
what do you think it is ? 
you have been acting very strange the last few weeks . 
god stacy it 's not that sad . it 's just david soul and ricardo montalban . 
stacy ! i 've got water in my ears . do you have any q - tips ? 
god he hardly even talks anymore . 
i think they 're both virgins . 
he works for the airline . he 'll be out here . you 'll meet him . 
i do n't know . thirty to forty minutes . 
no . but it 's a nice idea . 
climax together . 
you 're right . probably penis mouth and neck . 
okay penis that 's one balls ... 
why do n't you put your mother 's secret book back ? 
i sent a letter to doug today . i 'll be so glad when he gets out here . 
oh come on . what is he ? fifteen ? 
stacy . how many times do i have to tell you ? you are really going to be beautiful ... someday . 
stacy . what does it matter ? he 's a stereo salesman . you want to marry him ? you want to have kids with him ? you want this guy to come home fifty years old and he 's still got that little pacific stereo badge on ? come on . 
i guess ron has n't called yet . 
you 've got to get used to working christmas . people are always screaming and yelling ... then they get home and they 're all christmasy . 
boy i am so glad to be through with all these games . 
doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like . that 's why i 'm marrying him . 
do n't you dare you 'll never hear from him again . 
hey ! that 's my line ! 
so tell me do you like ron ? is it serious ? 
you 'll always remember your first time . 
was it great ? 
just kidding . about 10cc . 
there 's nothing to it . 
what 's the big deal ? 
what variables ? 
what do you mean ' better in bed . ' you either do it or you do n't . 
oh give me a break stacy . you 're much prettier than them . 
i know . 
god . people exaggerate so much at this school . 
i hear some surfer pulled a knife on mr. hand this morning . 
believe it . 
if i did n't have a fiancé in chicago i 'd go for it . 
stacy what are you waiting for ? you 're fifteen . i did it when i was thirteen . it 's no huge thing . it 's just sex . if you do n't one of the other girls will . 
face it . with some guys you have to make the first move . a lot of guys are just ... wussies . 
i called them . if i was sitting next to a guy and i wanted to sit closer i 'd sit closer . if i wanted to kiss him i 'd just do it . you want ron johnson ? grab him . 
listen stace you want to know about guys ? i 'll tell you . they 're mostly chicken . before i met doug i chased after every guy i thought was cute . i thought if i gave out a vibe they 'd get the message and call me up . well guess what ? they do n't call . 
should we buy a frame for that ? 
just take his order look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny laugh a lot . 
come on stacy it 's your section and your man . 
do n't you like him ? 
how 's it going . 
what ? ah ... yes yes i see what you mean ... yes ... so you 'll be responsible then ? 
well certainly ... we 're always happy to cooperate with the police ... 
well uh . she did n't say mr. duke . but since i know you 're here with the police convention ... 
the woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed . i think she was crying ... 
oh ... yes ... yes ... this terrible war . when will it end ? 
mr. duke ? hello mr. duke i 'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago ... i thought i should call again because i was wondering ... 
do n't worry about a thing sir . just enjoy your stay . 
certainly mr. duke ! 
let 's have lunch ! 
there 's no hurry ! the race is over ! 
but he will be available ? perhaps later this morning ? 
well ... the manager mr. heem would like to meet him . nothing unusual . mr. heem likes to meet all our large accounts ... put them on a personal basis ... just a chat and a handshake you understand . 
tell me . when will the doctor be awake ? 
what confused us was dr. gonzo 's signature on the telegram from los angeles . when we knew he was right here in the hotel . 
i checked the register for this man thompson . we do n't show him but i figured he might be part of your team . 
sir ?   this telegram came for you . actually it is n't for you . it 's for somebody named thompson but it says ' care of raoul duke ' . does that make sense ? 
where is everyone ? 
we 're going to get my little girl . 
we 'll meet in three hours ? 
you know where it is ? 
they 'll be back . 
he 's right let 's move . be quiet and get to the exit . pair up grab the weapons . 
do n't be stupid drop the gun ! 
we ca n't risk letting them in . 
buddy i 'm a full - blooded chucktow . i ca n't think of a time my people have n't been takin ' it dry . the fact that we are being eaten now does n't even faze me ...   ... this is just another tuesday . 
just move ! 
we just smeared a skunk . 
where 's the tunnel ? 
follow me . 
this is it ! this is our only way out ! they have this place surrounded . we go out the front we 're dead . we go out the back we 're dead but if we go under them ... we might just make it .   now who else is in ? seven can go . 
hey ! no i 'm not trusting him either that 's why you and i will both be going with him . 
what 's it for ? 
what tunnel ? where ? 
do n't bullshit me ! if you know a way out of this place and you 're holding out -- 
no no no it was ... it was wild out there no time to think we just moved . he did n't leave me . he just ran .   he just ran . 
and that 's how i ended up here . 
unfortunately the worst of 'em are still outside . 
that 's the oldest of the bunch looked like the grandpapa . we caught the little one junior in the cooler there . as we 've seen what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed . 
it 's imperative that you get that truck moving . 
but not flush against the tunnel ? 
what 's in the back ? 
all right !   tell us about the truck ! 
anybody else ? 
we 're going to get help . 
anyone else ? 
let me make this clear ; if we stay we die ! 
how many ? 
four door ? 
is it gassed up ? 
what 's it for ! ? 
what 's going on between you two ? 
what do you mean what ? 
you 're wasting your time there 's no one out there . 
no one goes anywhere alone . least of all unarmed . 
will these boards hold ? 
he shot you the other time . 
he only shot you once . 
easy . we 're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before . some kind of animals . real fast volatile predators . one went through three of your patrons like they were kleenex . 
he 's dead . 
my husband ... 
there 's a bomb shelter over in durant by the iga on first . you all know where that is ? 
get something on that . 
come on ! 
move your ass ! 
if he does n't shut up ... 
move it ! 
move slow and move quiet . 
done . but you 're locked in .   will you hold the keys ? 
you are taking a chance that is not worth the risk . 
we 'll be on the other side waiting for you . if you become food i do n't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things . it 's your funeral . 
no but i will lock you in . 
fine chief . 
' eh chief ? 
hold that tight ! 
let 's move . 
ok . let 's see what happens . 
is there any other way out of this place ? anyone ? 
everyone take a role . let 's prepare the guns ammo and whatever else we can scare up . we also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here .   so who 's going into the basement with me ? 
as long as it 's dark they 're around . they hide wait for you to drop your guard and then attack . 
they 'll tear this place down within the hour . 
you'll hit us ! 
let 's go . 
nothing just lookin ' . 
right . were going to need some fire power .   do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here ? anything at all ? 
get to your cars ! 
go ! ! ! 
go ! go ! 
make a distraction out front and go for it out the back . there 's cars back there right ? 
wait god - dammit ! 
hold it ! 
that 's fine . 
okay well that 's something . 
father . the biggest the strongest ... 
if you are face to face with her dive left . 
i think -- 
we should stick together out there . 
i know . thanks . just do n't tell anyone i have a soft side . 
she 's still alive i hope . i would n't have made it this far if it were n't for the chance of seeing my little girl again . i need to get to her . 
her name is charlie . 
i admire your strength . 
you know you do n't have to do this .

i know .   ' this is a factory and we each have our jobs . the writer writes the director directs and the actress ... ' 
yup . claire ... please please tell mr. bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life we 'd make a lot better movies .

dad please do n't leave early . just because of mama -- 
and i ca n't understand how it can hurt to be honest but the more i tried to explain -- 
it 's already started dad ... with me . 
he 's a socialist then ? 
is kaminski a communist ? 
he talked to me today . told me to keep my mouth shut or i 'd get everybody in trouble . 
yeah i suppose ... dad who 's harry york ? 
i did n't have much to do with it . 
thanks dad .

i do n't believe this ! you jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you do n't even know who the hell i am ! 
just one minute ... 
why you ... you little bastard ! 
what is this ? 
they 'll mend . 
... not if i can help it . 
no i do n't hate it . 
i 'm telling you straight if you have any serious ambitions stay clear of the place . it 'll crush you . 
then do n't go to hollywood . 
are you really serious ? about acting ? 
are you an actor ? 
i would n't miss it . 
you can always come see it in london . 
that would be okay . 
goodbye harry . it was very good to see you again . 
no we 're not . 
very slow .   but we 're not going to stop are we ? 
it 's going to be slow from now on . do you know what i mean harry ? 
i 'd ask you to take me home but i 'm a faceless sinner .   ... you smell good harry . familiar you know ? i 'd ask you to take me home but ... 
dad too . i sold the house . i 'm a faceless sinner harry ... 
i got a new car . only it 's red . did you know mama died ? 
well ... you 're looking well . 
how did i look ? 
fine thank you . did you watch the show ? 
oh . why harry york . how nice to see you . 
no harry it 's not time it 's us . you and me . and i 'm telling you now that i 'll come to you okay ? i 'll find you . i will . 
yes you do . if you love me you can wait right ? a month six months whatever it takes . 
oh please harry ... do n't even think it . you 're the only person who ever ... it 's just ... ca n't you wait for me ? 
i know but ... there were so many people in there harry . every time i turned around someone was pressing against me ... watching looking over my shoulder touching me grabbing sticking things into me . when i feel somebody near me now ... anybody ... my skin starts to crawl . 
yeah . i do n't know . 
oh harry ... 
i love you harry . i love you . 
... touch me again and i 'll kill you you pig . 
i got your number mister man . 
i know . do n't tell anyone . 
yeah . it 's just ... something i got ta do i guess . 
thanks harry really but ... i ca n't explain it . she 's my mother . she 's just ... i ca n't give up on her that easy . 
what 's that ? 
i know a thing or two about marriage . you ... you understand me more than anyone harry ... maybe even more than mama . but ... you 're too important to me . i 'd fail you . i do n't know how or why but i would . and that 's a chance i just ca n't take . do you understand ? 
you should stickaround sometimes . look out for me . 
why are you always leaving me harry ? 
to quarter - horses . 
what a man ! 
ohhh that 's lousy scotch ! 
you ca n't drink . 
aside from meanness you 're almost perfect . there 's only one other thing wrong with you . 
you know something harry ? 
no she just did n't want me going to jail that 's all . 
harry i have to go home . i have to talk to mama . 
a misunderstanding people taking the wrong meaning from things . i was n't declaring war harry . i was just saying my prayers . 
i do n't know . not a war exactly . it 's more a ... a misapprehension maybe ... 
i do n't think i 'd be much good in a war ... 
... take advantage of me . 
this is another one of your schemes to get me off alone ... 
i should 've known ... 
where are we mean man ? 
have i told you how mean you 're turning york ? 
that sure looks like fun ...   you know how long it 's been since i was behind the wheel ? 
oh my god i look awful . 
who said i was a lady ? 
well ... to get a crack at something good you got ta earn it you got ta climb the ladder first . so you do you work hard and all these people behind you are pushing you up shouting you on . and then one day you realize you are you 're at the top ... and there 's nothing there . and you look behind you and there 's no one below . you 're just left there all alone ... swaying in the god - damned breeze . 
i just wanted to be part of something ... one thing one play or one movie something that was really fine ... memorable . and i could say : i did that i made something good . 
no harry i ca n't -- 
yeah and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are what 's going on inside their heads . sometimes you can hear it like a buzzing the things that happen in their heads . and you wonder : does anybody ever love anybody really ? 
i do n't know . it hurts harry . some things no matter what you do with them they just hurt . 
i took the early rounds . 
for not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter . 
nope . the studio pays . thank you harry . 
help yourself . everyone else has . 
what 's left of my blood . 
how the hell do you find me anyway ? 
harry i hate being in love . i do n't ever want to be in love again . i just hate it ! 
two lines ! two fucking lines ! ' my wife returns from europe tomorrow . i ca n't see you any more . ' just like that ! 
do n't tell me what to do just give me his head on a platter ! 
i called your god - damned office ! i want you to kill him harry . you 'll do that for me wo n't you ? i loved him i loved him ... that bastard . 
harry ? harry where are you ? ! 
i know . 
he deserves a show . he missed the movie . 
it 's midnight harry . my glittering raiments are dissolving . 
the hell you will harry york . 
yeah if i do n't make too big an ass of myself . 
but i do n't want to be like that . i want to do something ... 
i do n't have what they want harry .   harry will you tell me something ? how can i keep making movies when people in the streets are starving ? 
no they do n't do they ? 
you know the funny thing is : it 's not a great movie . i mean it could 've been but they screwed it up gave it a happy ending . and all my friends i know they 're going to smile and say they loved it . 
forget it . 
dick ... and my mother ! she acts like she 's on mars or something -- 
who ever thought they 'd be right for once ? jesus harry ... it 's a zoo back there -- 
well the studio told me not to . 
harry ... i met someone . 
i know what ability you 're interested in . 
not bad . it was slow at first but i 'm doing bits now . 
you jackass !   c'm on let 's get out of here . 
but ... but why harry ... ? why 'd they do it ? 
oh no ... 
yeah i read about that . terrible business suicide . 
not bad . but come on harry ; what 's the real reason ? 
me ? look at you ! what 're you doing in hollywood ? 
come on harry . this is america land of the free .   i thought we might go skinny dipping .   for starters . 
i do n't know harry . i ... i want so many ... 
... so you think i should go . 
what happened to him ? 
yeah but if i win this trip mama'll kill me . she hates russians . i do want to go though ... to new york especially ... but i wanted to do it ... 
i do n't know ... i did ... feel different ... alive . 
do n't be a rat harry . 
how 'd i look ? 
well ? what 'd you think ? 
hi harry . did you see the play ? 
well ... i 'll give it a try mr. york .

oh yeah ! i saw you in the newsreel ! 
i 'll ... take your word for it . so who are you then ?

yeah . well if you did n't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it . 
i 'm causing trouble ? ! you 're a pain in the butt ! you newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since i won that dumb contest . i 'm just sixteen you know ? who the hell cares what i think ?

that 's fine with me ...   get it ? fine . a fine ! hey c'm on c'm on what is this an audience or a jury ? 
why certainly . i wanted to get a peek at his face ...

i 'm going out ! 
you ... you 'd send me back would n't you ? you would . 
mama shut up ! 
i 'm not cured . i was never sick ! they had no business putting me in there ! my only responsibility is to myself now ! 
have n't you heard what i said ?

mama what 's ... 
it 's okay . 
i do n't care . 
it is n't in your hands mama . it 's my life . 
oh mama do n't you understand ? 
oh ma they 're not using me . it 's just a chance to travel see things . besides it 's the only way i can get to new york . 
yes ma . 
oh bullshit . 
sure . you shouted at me in the auditorium when i read my essay . 
do n't i know you ? 
excuse me . 
symington says ... 
no i 'm warning you ! who do you think you are god ? you bumble around with your folders ...   ... and your pencils ...   ... and your god - damn buttons ...   ... all your badges of authority ! but you have no authority ! you 're nothing ! you 're a zero ! 
i want outta here you understand ? i 'm ready to get out ! so you go back there ... you go back and you tell them to let me out ! 
'cause if it 's long enough which i doubt why do n't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass ! 
dr. symington how big is your dick ? 
you what ? 
doctor i hate to break this to you but my mother is a little batty . 
i 'm sorry . she misunderstood that 's all . 
oh for christ 's ... 
i never said ... oh look . that 's just a figure of speech . she said something funny and i said ... 
no ... what i mean is ... i 'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life that 's all . 
not at all . she brought me my fan mail .   i had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me . but i guess that 's the best thing about working in the movies . you make so many friends . i want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me was n't a mistake . 
yes . it was very good to see her . 
you did n't say ' symington says ' . 
oh that 's good very professional . in control . but the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away . 
this whole thing is a joke ! 
... did you really say that ? 
normal . average . 
besides i do n't want to be what you want to make me . 
you may discuss my predicament doctor . you may discuss it with anyone you like but not with me . i 'm not interested . i can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian . 
do you expect me for one moment to believe you have greater insight into my personality than i do ? 
oh ! are you really ? 
why doctor ! we 've only just met ! 
it ai n't for lack of trying . 
aw shucks ma'am . t'weren't nothin' . 
am i supposed to say ' thank you ' ? 
do n't make me sick . i 'd sooner drown myself in puget sound . 
as usual . everything as usual mr. farmer . just give me my due . 
that 's right . i ca n't understand a man who puts strangers over his family a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure . 
how ? what do they do for you kaminski and his friends ? they 're all anarchists ! traitors ! 
you 've sacrificed ? ! if you 'd practice law for decent folk instead of communists and indigents -- 
you 're poisoning that child 's mind . 
when 's the last time you saw a hundred dollars ernest farmer ? 
i can thank you for that . it was a hard - earned talent . 
but what -- 
i have ! 
i was hoping for a kind word little sister . 
little sister i do n't want you to feel any rush to get back to work . i want you to rest ... for a while anyway . 
you know little sister i never resented you for refusing to see me in the ... the hospital . i knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back . 
oh just leave those things for now . 
of course she has n't anything definite in mind . 
you 're not going anywhere ! 
where are you going ? 
and now you 're throwing everything away ? you 're gon na be a nobody ! nobody ! you know what that 's like ? ! 
you want to throw it all away is that it ? you had everything little sister . beauty ... a brilliant career ... a wonderful husband . you were a movie star ! 
you ... you selfish selfish child . at least talk to him hear what he has to say . 
i told him to come up ! i told him you wanted to show them all that there 's nothing wrong with you any more that you 're completely cured ! 
they want you back ! your agent called today ! do n't you understand ? he 's sending the scripts . he wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people ! frances you ca n't do this to your fans ! why they 've been praying for you all through this nightmare . you ca n't turn your back on them now ! look at this fan mail i 've been answering ! 
do n't ... talk crazy . 
oh frances do i have news for you ! guess who -- 
i do n't want you drinking frances . 
you know the surest way to lose an appetite is to drink little sister . 
say you promise . 
at one . promise ? 
i 'll have lunch ready by one . 
how long will you be ? 
where are you going ? 
what 's wrong ? 
please . i want you to . it would make me so happy . 
frances you remember my lawyer alma styles ? 
it 's your fan mail little sister . 
well they needed immediate answers frances . it 's good manners and good sense . you should n't be bothering yourself with these right now . 
and here 's one from nice mr. zeiss . he says that ... 
tell them who i am ! tell them who i am ! 
shhh shhh . you 're not going to jail frances . the judge has put you under my care . i 'll see you get the rest you need . 
it 's alright now little sister everything 's going to be just fine . 
smile little sister smile . 
... you will . 
yes but important people are concerned about this . judge hillier spoke to alma styles -- 
i 'll pay your way to new york . i 'll work i 'll slave . i 'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers or -- 
but they 're using you ! 
and you ... should be proud . you won that contest and made a name for yourself . 
do n't listen to him little sister . when you 're proud of what you are you do n't refuse the label understand ? 
i 'm not hungry . you two just enjoy yourselves . after all this is a celebration . 
are you all right ? 
and not a word of them to father . he 's agitated enough not hearing from victor . 
i should go . i should leave today . 
something 's wrong . i know it .   i 've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from hamburg . 
nothing . still nothing . 
and you look so lovely . 
scandalous ! what would your dear mother say ? 
that 's the nature of all progress william . do n't let your brother sway you otherwise . 
there there ... shhh ... 
it 's far too late for him to still be out . 
is he not back yet ? 
let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night i left .   he 's coming home to marry me . 
he set things right with a proper apology ... and now they 've put him in charge of dissection lab ! 
i have been waiting for this ever since . 
brother and sister no more . 
victor tell me why ! trust me ! 
does this have something to do with that man you saw ? 
why the change ? what about your work ? 
we need each other now i need your comfort and strength not separation and solitude . 
what of our marriage ? victor we 've had so much tragedy . i want this family to live again . 
what sort of task ? 
i thought i 'd never see you again ! 
do you know this man ? is there something between you ? 
if what you say is true it is a matter for the police ! 
but why risk yourself ? has n't this family suffered enough ? 
victor . i love you 
i give you my soul ... 
our decision . together . 
not as weak as i. 
i will be here when you return . 
if only i could . but one of us must stay . father 's not strong . willie 's just a child . who can look after them in your absence ? who can run the estate ? 
i wish to be your wife . 
brother and sister still ? 
is that what makes it so delicious ? 
all my life i 've known . 
you will .   what do you want victor ? 
prouder still . you 'll be the handsomest student there . 
father 's so proud . 
smell the air . wonderful . 
give me that child before you fill his head with drivel ! 
oh do give him here ! he needs to be comforted and held ! 
victor have a care ! you 'll make him dizzy ! 
he left a beautiful gift in her place . a baby boy . to cherish and love as our very own . your brother 
she was mother to me as well . but ours is the job of the living . it 's up to us now to hold this family together . we must think of father and be strong for him .   i can not do that alone . 
it 's not ours to decide . all that live must die . it 's god 's will . 
are you sure it ca n't hurt us ? 
are n't you ? 
maybe we should wait for mr. christy . 
the killer is still out there . 
bill -- bill -- bill is out there ... 
no no they 're all dead ... 
jack ? marcie ? ned ? 
he 's dead ... she 's dead ... all dead ... please save me ... oh ... poor bill ... oh my god oh my god ... oh god ... 
good night brenda . 
i guess ... 
i think we should go wake them up . just in case . 
i was careless . 
tomorrow is another day . 
what 'd you see ? 
next friday . 
i do n't know . probably be best for everybody . 
just a feeling .   nothing personal . 
oh thanks . i wish i could spend more time at it . 
you told her to sweep the courts . 
cabin b is ready . 
why do n't we run ? just run now ? 
what 's the matter with it ? 
do you have a dime ? a quarter ? 
they 're off now . 
did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field ? 
it sounded like brenda . 
i do n't hear it anymore . 
well it has n't been that long . 
it would n't matter except steve should be getting back pretty soon . it would n't look so great if he fell over them . 
jack and marcie are gon na be drenched . 
bad bulb or no power . it 's getting a little gloomy in here . 
how the ... did he get in there ? 
and then steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you do n't care about children ... 
i did n't know i was asleep ... what time is it ? 
i do n't know . 
i walked into it knowing i 'd get hurt but i thought i could stand anything .   i just was n't ready for that kind of pain . we were supposed to meet in l.a. when i got back there he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife . 
and it 's this place . it makes no sense but it spooks me . 
it 's long and personal . it has nothing to do with you or the other kids . 
oh my god ... 
un - hunh . 
i 'm not sure i 'll last all week .   i 'll tell steve . 
everybody except the girl who 's supposed to handle the kitchen . annie . 
steve said for you to start on the boats . 
you 're welcome . 
ned ? we 're gon na be working together for a while . you 're a nice guy without all the entertainment okay ? 
i 'll be along . 
how come ? 
everybody goes home ! 
i 'm going for 'em ! 
i swear to god our father that when you change into one of the undead i will kill you . 
okay okay i promise i 'll do it ! 
i promise . 
you 're gon na be okay are n't you daddy ? 
so all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door . 
other places have beds they also have cable tv a gym room service ... 
if it does n't have a pool we 're looking for a new place . 
it 's a flop house . 
what do you think mom would say ? 
that happens you 'll get it back . 
it 's just all our lives you 've been a pastor . for twenty years you 've preached trust in the lord . and then one day you wake up and say fuck him ? 
i did n't want to talk about this in front of scott because he gets upset . but you do n't believe in god anymore ? 
dad when i called the machine to check our messages there was one from bethel baptist . mr. franklin said he would n't permanently replace you until we came back . he said when we come home if you still feel the same way -- 
hey if we go to a motel we can swim . 
ai n't it the truth . 
it 's the bitterest of pills . 
what did i say ? 
do what ? 
what 's in mexico ? 
where are you taking us ? 
richie will you do me a favor and eat my pussy ? 
what 's going on ? 
me too . 
should i use the last bullets on us ? 
not many . 
watch my back ! 
we have to go back for daddy ! 
i 'm really sorry . 
are you okay ? 
you 're gon na let us go ? 
yeah we got a bible . 
creepy guy . 
feel this real wood paneling . that 's real wood too not that fake stuff . 
-- you got your shower -- 
-- you got your microwave -- 
what 'd you find kathy ? 
or rank .   but can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order ? 
do n't say my name . 
but are there ... i mean how many ... 
the woman i saw you with ... 
that 's what i hear . 
thank you ensign . 
sir ?   what did he say ? 
would you have the discretion to end it right then and there ? 
sir .   if tomorrow ... i was not under your command ... would the inquiry still go forward ? 
sir please ... if there 's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud ... 
i 'm saying we 're just friends . 
sir if someone is suggesting that i 'm a lesbian they 're wrong . 
permission to leave sir ? 
sir i want you to know that i had nothing to do with any of this .   not this article not -- 
see me sir ? 
so i 'll get a fair shot ? 
would n't dream of it sir . 
across the board sir . 
same rules for everyone sir . 
the shape does n't bother me .   it 's just that goddamn rotten stench . 
no sir . 
i think you 've resented me from the start sir . 
it 's this double - standard the separate quarters the deferential treatment .   it 's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met . 
it 's you sir .   and it started the day i came here . 
pardon the hour sir .   but you told me to come to you immediately if i felt i was being mistreated in any way . 
sir i just want you to know ... i 'm not here to make a statement .   i do n't want to make men look foolish . all i care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else i suspect . 
none at this time sir . 
really i have no problem with -- 
barber was my next stop sir . would 've had it regulation sooner only -- 
thank you sir .   but i expect a certain amount of pain . 
i 'm fine sir . 
thank you sir . 
newberry get a photo .   south ? 
fine by me sir ! 
ah c'm on ... 
you know i wonder what the secnav would think about it .   if i spoke with him . 
i 'm sure it is . 
you promise wickwire a fast ticket too ? 
i wanted the choice .   the chance to prove myself my skills my work me .   that 's how it should 've been . 
so the rhetoric gets you headlines . but the reality gets you in trouble . 
you were never going to let women serve in combat .   you always had a safety net .   or thought you did . 
what are you saying ?   that a women 's life is more valuable than a man 's ? that a women 's death hurts a family more ? 
you do n't know that . 
so ?   is n't the president jumping on your bandwagon ? 
if i have to ask again senator i 'll be asking in front of cameras . 
what changed ? 
did you set me up ?   did you set me up just to see me fail ? 
it should .   you nominated him for spec - recon just three days after you nominated me . 
you know him . 
lieutenant thomas wickwire . 
uh ma'am . 
ca n't complain ma'am . 
would i be the only one ?   the only woman ? 
uh question ma'am . 
captain dwyer .   technically . 
i know that sir .   ma'am .   it 's just that ... beggin ' your pardon senator but ... do you understand that this involves combat training ? 
thank you ma'am .   um may i ask what this is regarding ? 
spotted you chief .   pri one is to slip you some air so we 're coming down with a tank -- just something until the a - team shows .   over . 
flea ' cool cortez newman -- take your minis hit the water .   go go ! 
fuck .   basher - basher this is ground crew six requesting emergency extraction . stand by for a prc fix ... 
hey .   you okay flea ? 
do that . 
well flea i appreciate the respect you just showed me .   but i do n't need it and do n't want it -- not that kind of respect anyway .   it 's just gon na hurt us both okay ? 
so it really has nothing to do with actual brain size ? 
come on montgomery ... 
just do it okay ? 
i can make this wall without -- 
just a coincidence ? 
i was looking for him earlier but ... 
the navy cross ... 
which is guy - speak for ... 
so here we are again .   staring three years of operational duty in the face . 
yeah .   me too . 
you do n't crap out of spec - recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country .   he 's got a sea daddy somewhere . 
i do n't know i do n't care . 
sounds like an amazing coincidence . 
instructors typically pull three year assignments .   this guy 's in and out in one year -- your year .   that sound right ? 
what about him . 
i 'm tired of fighting back .   i just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world okay ? 
it 's done with royce .   let it go . 
no shortage of suspects . 
maybe .   though it did n't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it .   almost like ...   did i say he was class officer ? 
all i wanted was an honest chance . and if i could n't get it i could n't stay . 
sure .   i 'll join the crowd . 
still ca n't make up your mind huh ? got ta go royce . 
well let me warm you :   i 'm going though with this .   the more everybody fucks with me fucks with my head the more it just makes me want to finish .   so do n't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon okay ? 
you know royce i got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets too . 
so why are you telling me this ? 
i saw an article ... 
me ?   why me ? 
i feel like there 's men here there 's women here -- then there 's men .   but hey what 'd i expect ? 
it 's hard to find time to sleep royce .   much less keep up with my phone life . 
thank you royce .   it was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy . really thank you so much . 
you know right up until you said that -- i thought i did know . 
which is guy - speak for ... 
wai ' wait .   what happens if it works ?   four months of training three years of operational duty . what then ? 
sorry .   but after our days ...   so if i try this thing ... if i ship out to coronado ... what happens here ? 
get your dick back here .   it has everything to do with you . 
this has nothing to do with you . 
you need operational duty to really advance ... you need combat training to go operational ... yet combat training is off - limits to people with tits .   i 'm topped out at intel . forget the glass ceiling -- i 'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling . 
royce .   we 're the same age we started the same time -- and now you 're sitting in the upperdecks while i 'm still down in the bullpen . what does that tell you about the navy ? 
i take it you do n't either .   feet . 
just like you would be . 
is this my glory sir ? 
hate this part .   just sweating it out on the sidelines . 
thank you sir .   we hear back from the pentagon ? 
only four minutes to neutral waters sir .   why not ? 
quick - hit technique used by capone . rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles .   all his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride .   check the files -- dprk-57 -- i doped it out as a contingency plan :   seal team infiltrates picks up the package links up with recovery sub .   but do n't waste time opening and closing hatches .   they just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters . 
unless you whiskey run . 
north korean beaches are the best protected most heavily monitored in the world .   the civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an early warning system .   extraction team has to be small and silent -- i 'd go with seals over delta force . problem is do n't want to hold a conventional sub off - shore for target practice .   where 's the polk ? 
chances of recovery ? 
do we know it 's him using the beacon ?   not a decoy ? 
not due in for 22 minutes sir . watcha got ? 
lieutenant o'neil . 
this is insane .   you 've got no proof . 
we 're going over to her place to make salad and pasta .   just you know nothing special . 
do you uh know ... 
thanks for lying .   but you 're the class officer wick and it 'd just be weird if we hook up .   besides ... 
i ca n't go out .   not like this . 
first big night of liberty and no date ?   you 're pathetic wickwire . 
sorry did n't mean to -- 
let 's keep talkin ' wick .   just keep talkin ' to me ... 
how 'd you make it last time wick ? how 'd you get through this part ? 
you got anybody wick ? 
he was married ? 
that 's a good story . 
they had to kill 'em ? 
if you got a good one wick ... 
you really came back for more ?   of this ? 
wick .   they got your crew too ? 
who is it ? 
thanks wick . 
i did n't know they let you try again .   especially at your age . 
and how do you know that ? 
whose orders were those ? 
well now i feel so much better . 
grab an oar find a way to weight it down we 're gon na need it .   cortez help him .   flea ?   you take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead . 
so we got two full mini - tanks three minutes each .   ' cool ?   how much air in yours ? 
' cool ? 
i 'm lookin ' i 'm lookin ' ! 
if not firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area .   now how smart is that ? 
i do n't know ... 
what you gon na give it all up for a maple twist ?   how dumb you got ta be ? that 's exactly what they -- 
what 're you guys doing ?   huh ? 
shut up sir .   i 'm concentrating . 
show us where you are chief . 
15 sir . 
chief sir -- rescue team wo n't be here for 15 minutes .   what 's your air situation ?   over . 
good to see you again too sir . 
sure .   just like your men do . 
we did n't know we were compromised . firing would only've given away our position . 
i think you 're the liar . 
that 's not right . 
no .   yes .   i mean depends on -- 
was n't deemed a threat . 
should i be afraid ? 
green eggs and ham .   you 're not going to get anywhere .   you might as well put me in the cage . 
dick jane and spot . 
mccool 's that same rank .   we 're both j.g . 's . 
it also seems like a problem with the men 's attitude sir .   so maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead . 
i see .   so when a man tries to rescue another man he 's a hero . but when he tries to rescue a woman he 's gone soft . 
sir someone mentioned you received the navy cross .   may i ask what you got it for ? 
permission to get dressed sir ? 
chief sir i do n't understand why -- 
say again sir ? 
shut your hole slutnik . 
flea !   keep your eyes on that spot ! mark it mark it !   cortez ?   what the hell you waiting for ? 
cortez see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear .   try a wrench on that thing . 
all right fire - and - evade maneuvers . drop everything but weapons and the prc radio -- we 're gon na be high speed low drag all the way to the link - up site .   ready ? 
listen sex ape .   i 'm here to stay . and if you do n't want me for a roommate or classmate you got two options -- move out or ring out . end of file . 
that your desk ?   i 'll take this one . 
funny the c.o. says i can . 
anybody usin ' these drawers here ? 
your new roommate . 
then set out the good plates we 'll all have lunch .   my office will follow up with details .   jumping off now ... 
jordan dear .   how are they treating you ? 
awright .   how 's our girl doin' anyway ? 
are you truly mouthin ' off to a senior member of the senate arms committee ?   i mean i 'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts . 
commander are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin ' their fill ? these were supposed to have been discreet test cases -- 
she made it through s.e.r.e. training .   got a call this morning from -- 
think i overplayed it ? 
i 'll act surprised . 
that aside for the moment i 'm struck by the tenor the ill - spirit of your report ... the degrading remarks by other aviators ... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations ... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior .   in my seven years on this committee i 've never seen a downed aviator treated like this .   never .   i 'm deeply disturbed by this report mr. hayes .   not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well . 
i 'd like to think our next secretary of the navy would be prepared for anything mr. hayes . 
well i 'm just an old dame without much time left so you 'll pardon me if i jump right in here before they discontinue my blood - type .   i am deeply concerned over the navy 's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military .   case in point ... 
well i spoke with mr. hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off .   no more test cases . he was only too happy to oblige .   do n't play politics with me little darlin ' .   you 'd be up way past your bedtime . 
you 'll think about my offer ? 
i 've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began .   and that 's quite verifiable . 
i once promised you a fast ticket jordan and i always meant to make good on that .   come work for me .   i can always use a hard - charger on my team . 
the reality is this :   we send far too many men off to war .   i do n't need to compound the problem with women .   can you honestly tell me you wanted that life ?   squat - pissing in some third - world jungle with -- 
jordan .   i do n't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there 's more to be gained from the fight than the victory . 
i 'm saying it 's not going to happen . not when the president is set to turn this into a third - rail issue should i choose to ever campaign against him .   he will fry me six ways to sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and quite possibly for bringing them back in body bags . 
in face i do :   roper harris gallop -- they all come back the same . 
what he did was light the bandwagon on fire .   because he knows what i know -- that american families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm 's way . 
should probably ask him that . 
wickwire was there to help .   to be my eyes on the inside to make sure you were getting a fair shot .   at least that was the intent . 
absolutely not . 
jordan .   might we do this over lunch tomorrow ?   i do very much want to talk but now is scarcely -- 
sounds familiar . 
jordan .   i always hoped we 'd get together -- though just now i 'm gearing up for a child - care vote that -- 
gon na be visiting that all - woman 's america 's cup team in a few weeks -- if i were a gambler i 'd say dennis o'conner 's days are numbered .   but they 're in san diego so i thought i 'd take a quick promenade of the base . 
hmmm .   maybe i 'll ask when i see you in person . 
there 'll be more to follow -- but yes dear right now you 're the pick of a very large litter .   and your success would mean a lot .   jumping now ... 
yes dear . 
my office will fill him in and help expedite .   look forward to meeting you at the proper time .   jumping off now ... 
this is just a test case o'neil . but if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the navy 's official policy on women in combat .   or actually its official non - policy .   now who 's your immediate superior there ? 
high - school pentathlete ... rotc scholarship graduated with honors ... top marks in basic training ... and as it just so happens a constituent of my home state of virginia .   oh the things i 'll do for one extra vote . 
so everyone i talk to says you 're top drawer with silk stockings inside . 
but we can get to the west side faster . 
the jfk ? in the rain ! ? 
cut uptown take 8th to 57th then cut up broadway . 
he 's not going to do it . 
think we can fit up in there ? 
do n't you think we have enough ? 
what are you doing ? 
what are you doing ? 
animal i ca n't . 
my god . he 's going after the nest . 
yeah . why are you asking ? 
yeah i just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me . 
it 's all my fault . what have i done animal ? what have i become ? look at me . this is n't me . i do n't do things like this . 
he stole my report ! that 's my report ! 
great stuff animal . were n't you scared ? 
nearly four years ... 
no ! i just could n't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches . i wanted to have some adventure some fun ... 
well i can be tough if i want . 
animal you do n't think that 's true do you ? 
you know how i spent last weekend ? walking his damned dog . 
who was that french guy anyway . 
really ? i 'd like to find out . 
somehow i never thought your life was this exciting . 
oh my god ! they 're coming ! 
the network is on an intranet . it 's a direct feed into our computer system . 
our network covers the ranger games . 
come on the broadcast booth is right over here . 
i know a way . i know how you can get a message out of here . 
i thought you said there 'd only be a dozen eggs . 
i did n't mean for it to turn out like this .   look i lied to you . i 'm not a reporter . when we broke up and i came out to new york i was so sure i 'd make it . but i have n't . that 's why i needed this story so bad . i just could n't tell you i 'm a failure . 
you never said it was off the record . 
is this cause of me ? because of the story ? 
i do n't get it . if it 's the first of its kind how can it be pregnant ? 
are you sure ? 
what else do you know about it ? 
blood sample ? how close did you get to that thing ? 
and you think this creature is one of them ? 
and exactly what changes are you trying to effect ? 
i still ca n't believe it . how does a guy go from an anti - nuke activists to working for the nuclear regulatory commission ? 
sure . i 'd like that . 
i 'm sorry you feel that way . 
that was eight years ago . some people change you know . 
you 're still mad at me are n't you ? 
so you still picking apart cockroaches ? 
yeah well ... 
it 's good to see you nick . 
you must have quite some harem . 
i 'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity luce . if there 's a story here i 'm going to find it . 
wish me luck ! 
yeah well he just turned up in new jersey at the military command post . somehow all this is related to what happened down in panama . there 's a story here . i know it . you got any tape or glue ? 
remember my friend we saw on t.v . ? 
that 's the problem . he did . 
nick tatopoulos . 
he was my college sweetie ! look at him . he looks so handsome on t.v . what the hell is he doing in panama . 
it 's nick ! i know that guy . i know him ! 
i ca n't believe he put the moves on me . after everything i 've done for him . 
my life sucks . 
and i 'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of caiman 's expense p.o . 's . 
you 're kidding right ? 
the warm feeling of helping your fellow man . 
can i use some ? 
hey do you have any glue in your bag ? 
not anymore . mr. caiman i quit . 
we ? i do n't think so . 
you do n't understand i can get us information ... 
i 've got something on this . i know a guy on the inside with the military ... 
caiman wait . take me with you . 
i ca n't . 
mr. caiman i 've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year . and i 've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me . i 'm too old to be an assistant anymore . i need to know this job is going someplace . 
mr. caiman ... 
mr. caiman you 're married . 
are you serious ? he 's going to consider me for he job ? what else did he say ? 
just tell me did you talk with him ? 
did you talk with humphries ? 
he always has to make the big entrance . 
no i did n't . 
down there . 
those blue things ate everybody here ? 
i do n't know . 
look at that ... will you look at that ... they look like little children ... 
alex ? where are you going ? 
front armor is gone ! just slow it down a little ! 
the ships are gaining ... 
shit ! i 'm doing it ! i 'm repeating the damn computer ! 
all this from watching the .. historical records ? 
i do n't know ... it just was n't like him . 
you could order something in . 
why did n't you stop at the market ? 
alex you ca n't -just leave . 
oh alex get away from that thing ... 
the guy is terminally selfish ! 
all systems are working commander . 
all systems are working commander . 
no we do n't have an extra beryllium sphere . 
we need another one . 
it 's fractured ... 
computer what about our engines ? why do n't we have power ? 
the enemy is matching velocity . 
guys we 're sustaining structural damage ! ... 
i never get tired of that joke . 
what 's the weather like outside ? 
we 're getting major structural damage . 
how the hell is fred supposed to project a hologram ? 
let 's get out of here before one of those things kills guy . 
oh they 're so cute . 
where are the miners ? 
guy you have a last name . we just do n't know it . 
the lost footage . at the convention . the mysterious device in our last episo -- historical document . 
that 's why you built this ship ? 
you ... know us ? 
sure guy if you can stand the excitement . 
never doubted you for a second . 
he 's accelerating to mark 6 . 
well forget it !   i 'm not going .   this episode was badly written ! 
we should n't have to do this !   it makes no logical sense ! why is it here ? 
what is that thing ? it serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of choppy crushy things in the middle of a catwalk ! ? . ' 
wait ... jason here ! ... 
uh ... i hate to break it to you jason but i do n't know how to shut down a neutron reactor and unless you took a learning annex course i do n't know about i 'm pretty sure you do n't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either . 
so ... we get to shut down the neutron reactor ? 
jason ? ...   i do n't think the pig lizard was gorignak ... 
turn on the translation circuit . 
nothing . hold please . 
jason we 're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there . 
thank god . are you okay ? 
jason .. can you hear me ? 
clenched jaw ... 
how does the rolling help actually ? 
why does this sound so familiar ? 
you 're playing your good side . 
i could have held on to you ! ... 
self control ?   that 's funny coming from the guy that slept with every moon princess and terrakian slave girl on the show ! ... 
computer do we have a replacement beryllium sphere onboard ? 
computer can it be repaired ? 
no i do n't think so ... wait . they 're not but ...   something is .   oh my god . 
i do n't think that 's a cloud ... 
there 's nobody here . jason ... 
we 're leaving jason . we 're leaving now . 
we have no right to do this . they deserve to know . 
ninty - nine percent of acting is commitment . acting .   stella adler never manned a resonance cannon she taught acting ... 
well you have to tell them .   what if something happens ? we 're actors not astronauts ... we ca n't do this stuff ! 
who we are . do n't you think they 're going to be pissed ? 
wait . when are you going to tell them ? 
on the show i talk to the computer and repeat what it says . so that 's what they built . 
only answers to me . 
one minute    i 'm -   hey i 'm dressing . ' 
you know it 's one thing to treat us this way but how can you do this to your fans ? ... 
how much of a nothing ? not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing ? 
tommy look !   those lights ... 
what are you doing ? what are thev doino ? 
is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now ? 
we got the sphere but the commander 's down there with a bunch of cannibals !   teb reset the pod we 're going back . 
oh my god ! tommy ! stop the pod ! stop the pod ! 
i have one job on this lousy ship . it 's stupid but i 'm going to do it . got it ? 
i do n't know guys ... i mean he almost looked ... sincere . i know it 's bizarre ! 
do n't do it tommy . he 's not worth it . 
you got ta admit they do love him . 
you 're kidding . when for ? 
this is great !   they 're going to start eating each other out there . 
i do n't want to see your hospital . 
not today . 
leave me now sir i am tired . 
well we must keep in mind the dower laws .   one third of everything we have is mine and since our negroes have been interbreeding it would be legally impossible to distinguish them . 
do n't condescend to me !   we have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind ... 
some things must never change . 
oh indeed ?   you know very well people are frightened of arming the negroes !   they beg you to consider the future .   what good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish ! ? 
virginia is outraged with your order allowing negroes to fight in the army .   there 's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal .   they wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests . 
well i would n't want to trouble you with this now . 
it 's an anti - christian dogma !   i can not believe you are so calm about it ! 
did you know that jefferson has proposed a law in virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church ? 
and have you heard anything from our dear friend sally ?   what with all the rumors getting back to england .   i thought she might inquire after us .   but then i believe she always looked down on us . 
that 's when sally fairfax was tutoring you ... 
when you lived with the fairfaxes ? 
you 're no fool george .   you never have been . 
and what ' prize ' do you see ?   what could we possible gain ? 
have you been reading what minister jefferson has to say ?   if he had his way all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome . and that would destroy us as surely as a british victory . 
i can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated to be destroyed ... 
well a very real expectation is the british will hang you !   they 'll burn mount vernon and they 'll hang you !   our marriage is a business just as surely as ... 
my god what ? 
but to go to war over trade over money ?   surely there 's still time for a compromise . 
war ?   no !   i did not !   when you said compromise was possible i believed it was probable .   there 's no middle ground at all ?   we 're the king 's children ! 
my god these people mean to go to war !   they really mean it . 
well i remember a philosopher who said something that i used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements ... but which i now see means us all . 
you remember george when we were ' studying ' the great philosophers ? 
now that is a lie !   see how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet !   when you break off your engagement to martha curtis i 'll divorce william !   do you hear ?   you get what you want from this world then throw it all away on love ! 
is it ?   william says now you have requested a british commission why not colonial ?   i 'll clear it up for you sir because as a british officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that it will even get you into polite society ! your dream come true george the only dream that really matters to you . 
and what is this then ?   been off to fight the french because you are a patriot ?   or is this you gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war ! ? 
george you know i only love you but ... 
is that the truth ?   well we ca n't carry on like animals any longer . 
well the widow curtis will bring you riches position land even half - grown children .   you wo n't have to do anything at all !   you sha n't have to do another thing to prove yourself . 
think what the play means william . perhaps these words have a place in the real world . 
except for that quite like home ; england that is . 
oh but you must not mind my talking about you !   in fact william says my main job here at belvoir is to civilize you ; to make an honest english gentleman out of you . 
so you are william 's wild young neighbor ?   or should i say ' brother ' ; william claims you as a member of his family .   i have heard so many unflattering tales about you and i understand that except for you this ' family ' is quite cultivated . 
voltaire of course ... 
and dost thou live to ask it ? 
i 've been surprised in an unguarded hour but must not now go back ; the love that lay half smothered in my breast has broke through all its weak restraints and burns in its full lustre .   i can not if i would conceal it from thee . 
those people ?   i doubt they 'd think of this .   ooo you 're wonderful this color ! 
why ?   juba was an african and you want to look the part -- hold still . 
let 's get you darker ! 
i do n't laugh at you george .   i like you .   i like you because you will never ever make it as an aristocrat ... and that 's because you 're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings . 
and to think i am teaching you to become one of them ... 
is it ?   well i 'm scared of what we 've become in our freedom . 
do you ?   when i saw those men yesterday in the field ... and the women and children in those hovels ? i 'm not so sure if america is as far from england as i 'd hoped . 
the place to want to be is america . every english child dreams of it . i dreamt it . 
perhaps you best ask why you wish it .   you asked william to teach you manners philosophy decorum ... as i said it 's completely stupid . 
it 's stupid of course . 
that 's just my interpretation . actually it 's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners . you see ?   walk in a gently ' z ' . there are four distinct movements ... 
in the minuet george every movement is significant like the strut of cranes ... 
the word ' minuet ' finds its source in minitus which is latin meaning ' small ' or ' orderly ' . 
capture them ?   well i 've never seen anything like it so ... of course i 'm curious . 
africa ?   that 's so far ?   how do they get here ? 
where ... do those men come from george ? 
what took you so long ? 
go get your stuff . 
you do n't act like it ? 
were you scared up there ? 
oh shit ... i 'm sorry ... i thought that was ... i 'm so sorry ... 
guy 's got a fucking pink toilet for christ 's sake . 
you 're as bad as harry ... 
are you going down ? 
he 's doing the same thing you did to him playing letterman on tv . 
harry what 're you doing ? you 're supposed to be in the hospital . 
because a movie star can never order straight from the menu . they have to think of something they have to have that is n't on the menu . 
continental but it does n't matter . martin wo n't order from the menu . 
harry ... my god ... 
hey chili ? look at me . 
whichever . let 's talk about it tomorrow . 
no . i do n't mean that . i just meant in general . 
i think you could be an actor . i know you 're acting sometimes but you do n't show it . 
how 'bout chili 's hollywood adventure . 
so what about your story . you thought of a title yet ? 
for starters marty was n't martin back then . 
you do n't like martin much do you ? 
not unlike the way nicki met him . except it was a wrap party . why ? 
definitely not martin . movie stars never pick up the check . they have no idea what things cost . most of them do n't know their zip code and a lot do n't even know their own phone number . 
that was martin . he wants to have lunch tomorrow . that is if you can make it . 
a locker at the airport ? jesus christ harry . tell me you 're not really that stupid . 
well actually martin the movie we came to talk about is mr. lovejoy . 
you were supposed to wait for me with harry at the restaurant . 
and you think the movie business is any different ? 
yesterday you were a loan shark . 
i want to know . 
what do you get out of it ? 
i do n't want to act in it i want to produce it with harry . especially if i help him get martin . 
you and harry'll make a great team .   i 'm gon na make a deal with him . 
then you 've read it ? 
i think it 's not horrible . 
i already read it . harry left a copy at the house . 
i just caught the end . 
right . see how your story ends . 
do n't go out of your way . 
yeah well martin is known for his flipping . he flips over a script and when the time comes to make a deal he flips out . 
harry 's dreaming of a forty - million- dollar production he 'll never get off the ground with a star he 'll never sign . with or without my help . 
i married martin . that was a full- time job . 
yeah you know when bette comes up to the guy on the porch gives him a flirty look and says ' i 'd kiss you but ... ' 
i know i 'm better than what i 've been doing the last ten years walking around in a tank top and fuck - me pumps waiting till it 's time to scream . 
yeah ... that was a good scene . i mean for a horror movie . 
you saw that one ? 
... that 's what we finally decided . 
i spent all day crawling out of a grave . the costumer kept bitching 'cause i was ripping my nylons - 
yeah well make sure you lock it on the way out . 
lemme get this straight you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before ? 
what 're you doing here ? 
how much is the wife offered ? 
a real bargain . 
but a week . that 's a hundred and fifty percent a year . 
the interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand ? 
i know what a vig is . 
what if it was ? 
you broke in ? 
chili and me . 
harry we spoke with martin . 
harry what 're you still doing with those guys ? 
what i 'm saying harry is i want you and your new buddy to get out of my house . 
well . i got an audition tomorrow . 
with your experience you could always become an agent . right harry ? 
that miami flight that went down it was on the news every day for about a week . harry must 've been busy . 
maybe you did n't hear me . 
how did you get in the house ? 
harry are you going down or you want me to ? 
i do n't have a dog . 
when i came upstairs you stayed to finish your drink . i told you to turn off the tv when you were through .   come to think of it i also told you you could sleep in the maid 's room . 
be quiet and listen . 
and after all you have such morals . 
but you are interested ? 
lufkin . his ... agent . 
oh for christ 's sake - 
' it ' did n't slip away martin you did ... when you went off to fuck nicki in the middle of my birthday party . 
hello martin . 
get up . 
dodge .   dodge . 
why not ? 
did you ? 
try wednesday . 
other than the obvious there 's nothing wrong with him that i can see not on the outside . 
i do n't know what else you 'd call it . he 's breathing on his own but his pupils are completely blown out . he 's totally unresponsive to pain .   what happened up there ? 
i 'm no doctor . but i 'd say he 's in a coma . 
oh yeah . 
seen a lota movies . 
maybe he is n't alone . 
so we kill him ? 
maybe that is his boat . 
i 'm telling you i saw somebody . i do n't know who it was . but i saw somebody . 
i like my job . 
guess i 'll just keep working . 
what other choices have we got ? 
this 's gon na hurt a little . 
or uninvited guests . 
if this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago we just hit the jackpot . 
ever heard of insurance big boy ? 
bring it on dude . 
supposing one of those cables breaks under tow . 
out here ? what so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now ? 
one more ? 
amidships starboard at the beam . just under the waterline . i do n't think it 's a problem . 
i ca n't believe you . dodge 's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share . 
nothing . let 's get outa here . 
yeah . fine . i just thought i heard something is all . 
better than starving to death . 
sudden flashes of light . 
headache nausea lights ? 
any dizziness ? 
because of the gold . 
you 're a pal . 
maybe six feet . lanky . i did n't get a good look . he was far away . but i saw him . i saw him as sure as you 're standing there . 
that 's a good thing ? 
that 's what i call a payday . 
probably did n't have time . 
you mean before she sank . 
looks like one hell of a stick up his ass . 
could be a fishing boat . 
showed him a hell of a lot more than that . 
morning everybody . 
maybe twenty gallons an hour . 
i do n't give a damn about the gold . 
it 's a trap . there was no way we were gon na get away with that gold . nobody ever does . it 's just the bait . this ship sucks people in and it never lets them out . 
it 's the ship . the ship 's making you think this way . 
murphy do n't you see what 's happening ? 
and now you 're gon na kill me is that it ? 
so you killed them ? 
you killed them . 
greer 's gone . he broke out of the tank . 
what happened ? 
if the weather holds it might not be so bad . 
they went crazy . 
maybe it was more than that . 
what do we do with him ? 
right here . 
epps over . 
just lucky i guess . 
i do n't know . 
she said the ship was evil . that we had to leave right away . that if we did n't we might never leave . 
more than just a mutiny . more than just the gold . 
something bad happened here murphy . 
no . i think they are were just passengers . innocent victims . 
what happened . 
maybe hallucination is the wrong word . it was more than that . as though they were showing me . 
i do n't know what else you 'd call her . one second she was there the next she was gone . 
no . someone else . a girl .   i 'm not sure she was ... real . 
when you found me yesterday at the pool . i 'd seen ... something .   someone . 
are we smart enough to avoid that ? 
the what ? 
what do you think happened on this boat ? 
could n't sleep . 
it 's not gon na hold us . 
it 's a good bet they 'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too . 
maybe the other ship took the worst of it . 
the page 's missing . then their sos was real . 
the same day she supposedly went down . 
but who -- ? 
only something must 've gone wrong . 
you 're saying they mutinied for the gold ? 
they 're dead in the water that morning . four hours later the captain 's relieved of his command . and that evening they issue a general sos . 
same . any luck ? 
he needs a doctor . 
yeah . just a bird . just a stupid bird . 
no cowboy shit . right . 
guess that 'd be me . again . 
so we find this guy and make a deal with him . 
it was n't you . it was somebody else . there 's somebody else aboard . 
of course i 'm sure . i saw him . 
i saw him . just a minute ago . some guy . 
there 's somebody else on this boat . 
the guy . he just came this way . 
did you see him ? 
why not call for help ? 
maybe they did n't want it back . maybe the whole fat deal was insured . 
you 're more practical than superstitious . 
you think she 's sailing without a crew ? 
so what did happen ? 
well suppose she got a little further north than she should have .   got stuck in the ice . the passengers and crew evacuated . she froze into the ice pack which moved further north where it froze in solid . they write it off . fifty years later the whole global warming thing happens . the ice melts she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her . 
she was sailing up north right ? 
what 'd you find up there ? 
they must 've scuttled it . nobody just lets a ship float away . 
go on . 
it 's my pen name . 
just do it ! 
what 's wrong with you ? ! tell him i 'm not here ! 
i - i'm not sure ... yeah maybe . 
i was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry i 'll be completely out of her life in a few days . 
are you going to yell at me ? 
it 's nothing -- it 's just some hormonal thing ... do n't worry about it ... 
tell her to forget it - i do n't need her help . 
i guess . 
what is it now ? 
i - i really have to get up early for class tomorrow . 
hi .   look i 'm kind of tired - i think i 'll go to bed . 
god how horrifying . 
not the maxine ? 
how should i know ? 
look at me -- i 'm not even listening to a word you 're saying . 
look i told you i 'm not going to college . 
will you get off my back for once ? 
nope . what are you making pancakes ? 
but ... can i still get that scholarship to the art academy ? 
help me what ? 
i did n't check my messages ... 
what do you mean ? 
i dunno ... would i have to take classes and stuff ? 
... wow ... 
i 'm not really sure - working i guess ... 
uh - oh . 
i 'm not sure ... i mean ...   i guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it 's so shocking ? 
it 's complicated ... i guess i 'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it 's hidden or something ... 
well i got the idea when i was doing some research and i discovered that cook 's chicken used to be called coon 's chicken and so i decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism ... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture ... 
i dunno ... i just like don knotts . 
it 's supposed to be don knotts . 
enid . it 's sort of like a diary i guess . 
but i feel weird ... it 's so sleazy . 
what ? i 'm just kidding around with the customers ... it 's my shtick ! 
okay okay ... i wo n't say a word ... 
but i was only trying to be friendly ... 
why ? what difference does it make ? you already got his money ... 
you can count on me sir ! 
hey josh . 
just take my word for it ... if she ever finds out about this i 'll never hear the end of it ... 
because if you do i 'll kill you ! 
i do n't think we should ... look you have to totally promise me you wo n't tell becky about this . 
i could n't sleep ... i should get going ; i feel really weird ... 
why do all guys have to play stupid guitars ? it 's so typical ... either they 're into cars or guns or sports or guitars ... it 's so obvious ... 
why do you have that stupid poster ? 
it 's just my stupid way of getting attention ! god i practically love you josh ! 
that 's just the way i am ! 
you 've never once said anything even remotely nice to me . 
then why do you hate me so much ? 
are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms ? 
i guess . 
can i come in ? 
i just stopped in to say hi . 
hi josh . 
but this guy is like a one - of - kind rare butterfly and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat ... 
come on josh ... do n't you want to see where he lives ? 
oh my god that 's him ! 
i figured something like that ... 
that 's not him ... jesus stop freaking me out . 
no i 'm serious . give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell . 
shh ! he 's back there . i can see his hair bobbing up and down . 
this is the ultimate . it 's like the taj mahal of bad fake 50 's diners . 
it 's just an excuse for us to spend time with you . 
so josh will you give us a ride ? please ? pretty please ? it 's going to be super fun ! 
that guy rules ! 
so josh ... 
i 'm afraid i do n't understand . i simply wish to know -- 
well hello there young employee of the sidewinder . 
it just came yesterday ... 
maybe an orange juice . 
you 're lucky then you ca n't see the veins on that guy 's biceps . 
i dunno ... 
i 'm gon na finish packing tonight ... i 'll bring it over tomorrow sometime . 
it 's fine . 
i 'll get a job tomorrow i promise . if i do n't you can totally tell me to fuck off . 
of course it 's a good idea ... it 's our plan . 
please let me come with you . please please please ... 
i 'm sorry about the other day . i do n't know what 's wrong with me ... i really do want to move in with you . 
i need to talk to you . 
you 're the one who 's still living out some stupid seventh - grade fantasy ! 
because you 'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it . 
when was this ? 
why ? what did he say ? 
what ? when did you see josh ? ! 
i just mean it 's weird to me ... i 've never been anywhere near here in my life . 
where are we ? this is a weird neighborhood ... 
i do n't believe you . 
what are you talking about ? who ? 
so should i come over ? 
i ca n't believe it - he actually scored ! 
do you still want to do something tonight ? 
oh yeah ... maybe ... seymour 's going on his big date tonight and i kind of want to be around when he calls so i can hear how bad it went . 
what thing ? 
you 're insane . 
i ca n't imagine spending money on towels . 
why do you care about this kind of stuff ? 
i ca n't afford stuff like this right now . 
yeah but maybe one of us should at least try ... 
i am not -- i just think it 'd be funny to see what he 'd do ... 
no really ... 
i think one of us should fuck josh ... 
yeah i guess ... call me ... 
i ca n't it 's seymour 's birthday ...   shit ! what time is it ?   i have to go to the store ! i was going to make him a cake ... 
yeah thanks . 
do n't worry . 
oh yeah right like i 'm gon na let some asshole with a goatee own goofy gus . 
fuck it . everything must go ! 
i told you - my manager was a total asshole ! do n't worry i 'm going to get another job ... and anyway i have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime ... 
we were such desperate sluts back then . 
that must have been when my dad was married to maxine ... 
was n't it like eighth grade ? 
i dunno but next week is my last class ... 
yeah maybe it 'll be okay . at least i 'll get to see every movie for free i guess ... i had to lie and tell them i already graduated ... 
... maybe we should be lesbos ... 
that 's not true i just hate all these obnoxious extroverted pseudo- bohemian losers !   sometimes i think i act so weird because i 'm crazy from sexual frustration . 
yeah right ... believe me at this point i 'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me ! 
he 's like the biggest idiot of all time ! 
which one ? 
or maybe ... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos ? maybe that 's why we spend so much time together . 
i wonder if i hang around with you because you 're like my surrogate mother figure or something . like i have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly . 
nothing . do n't worry ... i promise i 'll get a job next week . 
i 'm working on it ... i 've got a few leads ... it 's just that right now i have all these projects that take up all my time . 
but those are our people ... 
that rules ! 
at least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining ... 
god how can you stand all these assholes ? 
that guy is totally amazing . 
just now ... i went with seymour . 
anthony 's ii ! 
you wo n't believe it ! guess ! 
give me all your money bitch ! 
i 'll be right back i 'm gon na go get a beer . 
aw c'm on this is a fun party . 
if i promise you there 's really a party with a lot of guys do you promise you 'll go ? 
it 's a surprise . 
i know a party we could go to ... 
let 's get out of here this place makes me sick . 
forget it . i 'm sure it sucks . all these movies suck . 
this morning at seymour 's garage sale . 
hey you have to see my new good luck charm . 
everybody 's too stupid ! 
it 's not like i 'm some modern punk dickhead ... it 's obviously supposed to be a 1977 punk look but i guess johnny fuckface is too stupid to get it ! 
it 'll only take a second . 
yeah he 's beyond human stuff like that . 
i wonder if he 's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or -- 
as always . 
let 's go hassle josh . 
i bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back . 
we still have to go in there sometime . 
fuck you bitch ! 
what ? how long have you been standing there ? 
okay okay i promise ... jesus you 're out of your mind . 
you just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you . 
what are you talking about ? 
what is she black now ? 
we 're not sure yet that 's why we 're looking . 
forget it i ca n't explain it ... 
yeah but ... you know what i mean . 
i dunno ... i kind of like him ... he 's the exact opposite of everything i really hate ... in a way he 's such a clueless dork that he 's almost cool ... 
oh yeah ... 
it was so cute how he had his own little bags . i thought i was going to start crying ! ... do you think they 're gay ? 
i think it 's cute - look at his little weasel teeth . 
ew look at this ... 
come on it 's too late now ... 
i 'm afraid if i see him i 'll start feeling really bad again . 
this is way too creepy . 
this kind of thing must happen to him all the time . 
he does n't even look that bummed out really . 
he 's insane ! 
totally ! look ! 
i dunno ... 
he 's still just sitting there . god this is totally unbearable ! 
oh my god he just ordered a giant glass of milk ! 
it 's obviously him ! 
is he wearing a green cardigan ? 
she says she wants to mmph ! 
i 'm going to tell him you said that . 
it 's still twenty - five minutes early . 
yeah josh c'm on ... move it ! 
god i think josh is too mature for us . 
shh it 's his answering machine ...   we hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint beep . 
why do i always have to do it ? 
oh yeah . 
which loser ? 
that larry guy -- what look was he going for ? a gay tennis player from the forties ? 
i bet ! actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame fake shtick . 
no she was the second wife . the third one was the super - bitch - maxine .   there ! look at her ! 
there 's my dad with joanie . 
look that 's back when i hated you . 
look at how cute i am ! 
i 've been looking all over for this . 
hey - why do you have this ? 
i dunno . john ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that i have to fast - forward past to get to the good stuff .   there 's supposed to be a don knotts movie on here someplace . 
wait ... i just want to see what 's on this tape . 
does oomie really like this show ? 
oh we totally have to . 
i know . and he 's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail . 
what does that even mean ? 
you loser ! 
hi al ! 
i feel as though i 've stepped into a time warp ! 
hey look at this ... 
maybe they 're slowly poisoning us or they 're planning to brainwash us and -- 
maybe there 's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the quality cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us . 
you know sacrifice virgins and stuff ... 
in fact never . 
we should follow them ! 
i know it has n't really hit me yet . 
yeah i just picked the one that sounded the easiest . 
soon ... i have to wait and see how this summer class goes . 
just look at them ! 
look at these people behind you . i 'm totally convinced they 're satanists . 
god think about that ... that 's actually totally depressing . 
god just think we 'll never see dennis again . 
he better watch out or he 'll get aids when he date - rapes her . 
oh my god look ! is stacy himmler going out with rod harbaugh ? 
what ? why ? 
shut up ! 
just think we 'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again . 
this is so bad it 's gone past good and back to bad again ... 
these assholes are saying that i have to go to summer school and take some stupid art class ! 
what ? ... oh suck my fucking dick ! 
i know i liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict ! she gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she 's little miss perfect and everybody loves her . 
god what a bunch of retards ... 
see that 's exactly the kind of thing we 're trying to avoid . 
what are you going to be when you grow up todd ? 
just because . 
we 're not . 
what about me ? am i not even here ? 
well we wo n't keep you . 
what are you doing here melorra ? 
oh yeah that 'll definitely happen ... 
yeah we graduated high school -- how totally amazing . 
oh yeah like he even noticed . 
i 'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck - ups and retards . 
where did you get those pants ? 
it 's kind of falling apart . 
i thought it was n't for sale . 
who does ? 
do you have any other old records besides these ? 
that 's okay ... 
how much is this ? 
a what ? 
go die asshole ! 
that tape sucked by the way ! 
that 's not even -- 
i know it 's over asshole i -- 
tell me what ? 
i hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago ... there are no buses on this street . 
... are you waiting for a bus ? 
hi ... what 's your name ? 
thanks for the tape - i 'll have to pay you later i 'm broke . 
fuck you you stupid redneck hick ! 
i did too ! 
did you bring that tape ? 
you 're late asshole . 
why do you even want it ? it would look stupid on you . 
i was wearing that dress the day i lost my virginity . 
five hundred . 
that 's five hundred dollars . 
i can treat him any way i want to - i 'm an adult ! leave me alone ! 
shhh ... i really need to get some sleep . 
i was just thinking out loud ...   i mean you 've got this whole thing with dana -- i 'm not going to let you fuck that up ... 
yeah well ... me neither ... 
no ... forget it ... 
what ? ... maybe ... no ... i dunno ... 
god dana 's going to kill you ! 
what 's the matter with you seymour ? do n't you like me ? be a man for once in your life ! 
what do you want ? 
i 'm serious ! i 'm just so sick of everybody ! why ca n't i just do whatever i want ? 
who cares ? let 's just go ... what 's stopping us ? 
i 'll drive then -- we 'll go out in a blaze of glory ! 
you know what we should do ? let 's go get in your car right now and just take off ! we could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life ... fuck everybody ! 
it would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it and i 'd just disappear and they 'd never see me again . 
i used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place ... do you ever think about stuff like that ? 
you know what my number one fantasy used to be ? 
oh yeah ... and dana ...   you were a lot more fun before you met dana . you 've been acting way too normal lately ... you 're a bitter twisted fucked - up guy seymour that 's why i like you . 
... maybe i should just move in here with you ... i could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until i get a job . 
i dunno ... i always feel like everybody secretly hates me . i 'm just paranoid i guess . i mean you like me do n't you ? we 're good friends right ? 
yeah but still ... it 's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that . 
how come in all that time i was trying to get you a date you never asked me out ? 
at least you 're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports ... they 're all such fags ! 
what are you talking about ? you 're disappointed every minute of your life . 
jesus how can you stand her ? 
where did you get this ? 
you need a bigger place - this is like a little kid 's room . 
fuck dana . i 'm sick of dana . 
what about this ? 
do you have anything to drink ? 
look i just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then i 'll leave you alone . 
can you at least let me in ? 
i had to see you . 
nothing . do n't worry i wo n't bother you any more . 
i do n't think you understand how i really feel about you seymour . 
in whatever way you think i mean . 
so do you like me seymour ? 
does that mean you do n't like me ? 
you must have done something to make her think you like me . 
what 's her problem anyway ?   did she actually tell you you could n't see me ? 
so that 's it ? you do n't ever want to see me again ? 
and you like them ? 
well when can we do something ? 
well forget the art show ... let 's do something else . 
of course you should . c'm on i 'm already a million hours late . 
i 'm going to this stupid art show and i want you to be my date ... there 's something i have to show you ... 
maybe ... i dunno ... he wants to be of course . i 'm weighing several offers at the present time ... 
i dunno ... okay i guess ...   i fucked that guy josh finally ... 
are n't you even going to ask me how i 'm doing ? 
what are you trying to get rid of me ? 
sounds good ... 
so what kind of stuff do you guys do together ? is she into old records and stuff ? 
yeah i 'll bet ! so how 's it going with what's - her - name ? dana ? 
no actually joe told me you were here ... so how come you never call me anymore ? 
where have you been ? i 've been looking all over for you ... i 've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you ... 
what are you going to like have sex with her on your first date ? 
what ? you 're kidding me ... 
so what happened ? 
hi it 's me ... 
well uh ... i 'm an expert - about stuff like this -- she was totally for real ! 
seymour ! i promise you that was n't a joke -- you have to call her back ! 
that did n't sound like a joke to me ... what did you write a personal ad or something ? 
wow !   what was that all about ? 
are n't you going to get that ? 
i wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them ? 
never mind it 's way too complicated ...   did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you 're totally confused all the time ? 
oh wait you met him ... remember that guy josh ? i 'm like practically obsessed with him but i ca n't do anything about it because becky would freak out . 
actually i 've got a total crush on this one guy right now but it 's a really fucked - up situation ... 
i know . it 's not like it makes all your problems go away . 
i mean i 'm eighteen years old and i 've never even had a real steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks ! 
yeah well you 're not the only one . everybody i know has totally fucked up problems ... it seems like only stupid people have good relationships ... 
what like a girdle ? 
what is that ? 
are you okay ? 
no doofus ... blow it out ! 
you can open your eyes now . 
do n't you trust me seymour ? 
i promise i 'll take good care of it . 
hey can i borrow this ? 
so i do n't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then   even though there was stuff like this ? 
yeah but still ... 
jesus i 'd go nuts if i had to work in an office all day . 
what are you a fry cook or something ? 
you work at cook 's chicken ? 
what are you a klansman or something ? 
what the fuck seymour ? ! what is this ? 
i dunno ... because i ca n't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you ca n't get a date ... 
wow this is so cool ... 
it does n't matter i 'm not staying long ... i just want to make sure i convince you not to give up yet . 
i 'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar ...   at least you 're an interesting person ... at least you 're not exactly like everybody else ... 
yeah well i ca n't relate to humanity either but i do n't think it 's totally hopeless ... 
it 's not hopeless ... 
we just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who is n't a total idiot that 's all . 
i told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label . 
just wait here . 
well offer her a seat ! you want me to do it ? 
jesus seymour . 
this bar 's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from . 
so why did you bring this along ? 
relax seymour relax ... 
c'm on seymour please ? 
oh my god ! 
wow ! look at all these creeps ! 
fine i 'll go by myself then ... 
please ? we have to ! 
we 'll just go in for one minute -- it 'll be a riot ! 
please seymour ... becky and i have been dying to go in here but we ca n't get any boys to take us ...   please ? 
oh my god ! we have to go in here ! 
josh ? he 's nobody 's boyfriend ... he 's just this guy that becky and i like to torture . 
yeah yeah yeah ... just tell me your five main interests in order of importance . 
we need to narrow this down somehow ... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests . 
every guy has a type ! 
c'm on seymour i 'm trying to collect data here ! do n't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl ? 
okay what about this one ? are you into girls with big tits ? 
but putting that aside for now would you go out with her ? 
what about her ? would you go out with her ? 
mark my words by the end of this summer you 'll be up to your neck in pussy ! 
i mean it -- you leave everything to me -- i 'm going to be your own personal dating service ! 
i 'm totally serious ! 
no really ... i guarantee i could get you a date in like two seconds ... 
i 'm talking to you ... i 'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute ! 
no you 're not ! you 're a cool guy seymour . 
oh come on ! what are you talking about ? 
god look at this poster !   i ca n't believe this room ! you 're the luckiest guy in the world ! i 'd kill to have stuff like this ! 
wow ! this is like my dream room ! are these all records ! 
really ? can i see it ? 
you 're right about that .   so this is your record collection ? 
what was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks ? 
hey i was only kidding ! 
oops ! i dropped it ! 
yeah sure i guess ... 
yeah it took a while before i got a chance to play it but when i heard that song it was like -- 
how much is it ? 
is this one any good ? 
sure i guess . 
sure ! ... wait maybe not 78s but i can play regular records ... 
you know like weird 1960 's indian rock n ' roll music . 
do you have any old indian records ? 
i 'm sorry enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before i can nominate you .   i had to give it to someone else ...   but i 'm sure next year i can -- 
well they 're forcing me to give you a non - passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition ... but do n't worry -- i 'm sure i 'll be able to get you your diploma in the fall ! 
oh my goodness ... well the whole thing is just ridiculous and as soon as the school board is back in session next fall i 'm going to do everything i can to help you . 
did n't principal jaffee call you ? 
the whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it 's absolutely -- 
enid ! i 'm so sorry about what happened . 
let me know as soon as you can enid . this could be a great thing for you . 
well yes ... 
so what do you think ? 
as far as i know it includes housing and meals and everything ... it is really quite an offer ... 
well i know this is really short notice but i got a call from a very close friend at the academy of art & design and she tells me that i 'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program ... and well i hope you do n't mind enid but i took the liberty of submitting your name . 
do n't worry - it 's nothing bad . i was just wondering what your plans were for next year ? 
enid can i talk to you for a minute ? 
and how does an image like this help us to see that ? 
and how do you think this addresses the subject of racism ? 
did you actually do this painting ? 
these are all valid comments but i think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this . 
i see ... interesting ... 
and what was your reason for choosing him as your subject ? 
who is this enid ? 
and what can you tell us about this ... 
i think it 's really a wonderful piece margaret ! 
this shocking image of repressed femininity ! 
very good . now what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent ? 
i can see that ... now what can you tell us about it ? first of all what kind of sculpture is this ? 
what do we have here margaret ? 
is n't this a wonderful piece class ? this definitely falls into that higher category of art i was speaking of earlier . 
talk to us about it ... 
i think that phillip and enid can help us to see that there are - many different ways we can express ourselves .   we can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues ; emotional spiritual political ; of great importance . i hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class .   who is responsible for this ? 
wow ... finally . 
do you want anything ? 
actually he 's a really nice guy . 
oh hi ... i almost did n't recognize you -- i think i need to get glasses ; you 're all blurry ! 
make sure you 're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do ... oh yeah ! i have to show you something else ! 
what time ? 
that 's all you 're bringing ? 
so where 's all your stuff ? 
so whaddya think ? 
but how are you gon na pay rent and everything ? you do n't even have a job . 
i do n't know - i 'm not sure it 's a good idea . 
i do n't know ... i was thinking maybe i should live alone . i decided to rent that place we looked at . i 'm moving in next week . 
fuck you ! have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life ! 
you 're the psycho ! you have n't been able to deal with anything since high school ended ! 
there 's something wrong with every single place we look at ! why do n't you just come right out and tell me you do n't want to move in with me ? ! 
oh yeah i can tell you really love it ! 
what ? ! it looks totally normal ... what 's wrong with it ? 
twenty - seven fifty - three ... do you see it ?   that must be it ... 
i do n't know ! god do n't act so jealous i only talked to him for two minutes . 
he came into work . 
josh says this is a really good neighborhood ... 
it 's a totally normal average neighborhood ! 
yeah well you said you were busy ... look i 'd better get going ... i 'll call you tomorrow . 
just some people from work ... 
actually i 'm just about to go out with some friends ... 
how repulsive ! 
what happened to seymour ? 
god i 'm so sick of seymour . 
that guy 's band is playing tonight ... alien autopsy . 
do you still want to go to that thing tonight ? 
you do n't have to . i 'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job . 
do n't you want nice stuff ? 
i 'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we 're ever going to move .   are n't these the greatest towels ? 
look we have to get these ... 
no matter what happened it would be a big disaster ... let 's just try and keep everything the way it is . 
i thought we decided that josh was way too cool to be interested in sex and that he 's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that ... 
god you 're really obsessed ... 
go ahead ... 
well are we still going shopping tomorrow ? 
do you want to do something tonight ? 
if it makes you feel any better i do n't think you could 've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff . 
now are you going to get a regular job ? 
what was that all about ? i thought everything must go ! 
oh my god i remember this hat ... this was during your little old lady phase ... 
this is it ? i ca n't believe you 're selling some of this stuff . 
what are you talking about ? what kind of loser gets fired after one day ? ! 
i remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick daniel dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him . 
seventh ... you wanted to move out right then ! 
anyway now we can start looking for the apartment ...   do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment ? 
when are you finally going to get your diploma ? 
are you kidding ? it 's a dream job ! i ca n't believe you got a job like that without even trying ... god i wish that was my job ... 
get away from me ! 
have n't you heard about the miracle of masturbation ? 
face it you hate every single boy on the face of the earth ! 
you 're just jealous . 
he gives me a total boner ! 
you 're gross .   see that guy ? 
you hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you . 
... you do n't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment . 
god i ca n't believe you went to anthony 's without me . 
like what ? 
yeah well ...   so when are you going to get your job ? 
no it does n't . you 'll see ... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos . 
he 's a total asshole ... he does n't even need that wheelchair he 's just totally lazy ! 
i do n't know ... some people are okay but mostly i feel like poisoning everybody . 
he does that every single day . 
you cunt ! 
no way ... when ? 
where did you get that ? 
i totally totally hate you . 
i do n't believe you . 
what ? where ? ! 
we have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before i start my stupid job . 
how about this ? 
god are n't you tired of seymour yet ? 
ew ... when did you get that ? 
how about this one ? 
i did n't get it either . 
what was that all about ? 
why are we going here ? i hate this place . 
should we leave a note ? 
i 'll bet he never jerks off ... 
why do n't you ask him . 
waiting for the bus that never comes ... 
there he is ... 
where are we going ? 
it 's always closed ... 
did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade ? 
just promise you 'll do it . 
that 's who people want to rent to . it 's a known fact that it 's way easier to get a job and everything if you 're rich ... all we have to do is buy a few semi - expensive outfits and act like it 's no big deal ... it 'll be fun . 
i 've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we 're like these totally rich yuppies ... 
somewhere downtown . 
not really ... 
he should totally just kill himself ... hey here 's one   ... oh wait ...   you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats ... 
he was so excited when you bought that record -- you 're a saint ! ... god these apartments are super expensive ... 
that was truly pathetic . 
ew it 's like some gross rat ... 
what should we do ? what if he recognizes us ? 
the w.c. fields fan club newsletter ...   oh my god the national psoriasis foundation ! 
he wo n't see us ... we 'll just stalk him from a distance . 
i know ... would n't you be totally pissed off ? 
we should follow him home . 
are you sure ? 
do you think he knows ? 
what 's he doing now ? 
what 's going on now ? what 's he doing ? 
i ca n't believe it ! 
what exactly is a cardigan anyway ? 
shut up ! 
look maybe that 's him ! 
i know look at the way he drives ... he 's like an old man . 
what does it stand for ? 
you 're better at it . 
you call . 
you know the green cardigan guy . 
hey ! we forgot to call the loser ! 
fuck you ! 
what are you talking about -- who ? 
i want to do him ! 
i can never keep them all straight - was she the super - bitch ? 
i remember every minute of that party . 
what a little hosebag . 
you lent it to me in like tenth grade . 
what is this ? 
so what should we do ? 
is n't it weird ? it 's her favorite . 
we should call him and pretend to be the redhead . 
god that 's so pathetic . i bet she did n't even notice him . 
you can have that one . 
check out the personals ... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us . 
i might actually get the pasta special . 
who can forget this great hit from the 50 's ? 
god it 's so totally pathetic . 
okay okay ! 
or maybe not . 
that lets us off the hook . 
what do you do if you 're a satanist anyway ? 
much later . 
hey look the satanists are leaving ! 
god it 's so weird that we 're finally out of high school ... we 've been waiting for this our whole life ! now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want .   it 's such a weird feeling . 
did you sign up yet ? 
so when are we going to start looking for our apartment ? 
how perfect . 
i know she needs to die immediately . 
forget it ... 
uh oh ... do n't turn around ... 
unless they 're in your summer school class ! 
this is so bad it 's almost good . 
you loser . 
it 's totally sickening .   let 's see if they gave me the right diploma ... 
i thought chipmunk - face was never going to shut up . 
call me sometime . 
did you remember to pay the phone bill ? 
i wish i could see him . 
so josh if this guy freaks out will you protect us ? 
please josh ? 
did n't she ever tell you about that ? god she really is pathological ... 
on that pathetic fake blind date . 
look what do you expect ?   considering how we met you . 
yeah she thinks you 're a dork . 
that slut ! 
why would n't she tell me ? there 's no way ! she could never keep that to herself ... you 're crazy . 
what ? is she having some secret affair with josh ? 
why ? what did she tell you ? 
josh ! ? why would she be with josh ? 
i do n't know ... where is she then ? 
are you sure she was n't there ?   maybe she was just hiding from you . 
what the fuck is she doing ? ! she was supposed to be here three hours ago ! 
she 's not at home ? 
i 'd rather not . 
i hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul .   i could never forgive what you 've done to me and my child . 
we do n't have a relationship . 
i do n't care who he is .   he 's not taking my baby . 
everybody has a choice . 
if this is what the world will be like i do n't want to live in it . 
what do you want with my baby ? 
oh i 'm sorry .   this is peter venkman . peter janosz poha . 
good night janosz . 
no everything 's fine .   honestly .   thanks anyway . 
i 'm sorry .   perhaps some other time . 
actually i 'm not eating lunch today .   i have an appointment .   in fact i 'd better go . 
thank you janosz .   i 've learned a lot here but now that my baby 's a little older i was hoping to rejoin the orchestra . 
oh yes i got in a little late this morning janosz . 
thank you . 
egon i 'd rather you did n't mention any of this to peter if you do n't mind . 
this is my address and telephone number . will you call me ? 
does he ever mention me ? 
how is he these days ? 
do you ever see him ? 
okay whatever you think -- but not venkman . 
what are you working on egon ? 
hundreds of people .   believe me i did n't imagine this . 
that 's exactly what you said last week . 
no you did n't frank . 
thank you frank .   oh are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom ?   i asked you last week . 
thank you frank .   i 'll get the hang of this eventually . 
you 're also a human being frank . 
frank do you think you could give me a hand with these bags ? 
that 's a terrible thing to say . 
that 's not true .   it was 1620 . 
i think he likes you .   i think i do too . 
maybe i should call janine . 
so why do n't you give me a jingle in the year 2000 ? 
why do you say things like that ?   you 're so much better than you know . 
oh peter i did n't dump you .   i just had to protect myself .   you really were n't very good for me you know . 
for one night in your life do you think it 's possible for us to be completely real ? 
i want to stop getting involved with men who are n't good for me . 
i put them in your hamper .   i thought they were dirty . 
okay but it 's not a date .   it 's a dinner . 
does she know anything about babies ? 
i 'm not here to date .   i ca n't leave oscar in a strange place with someone i do n't know . 
they did n't find anything ?   in the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing ?   so what do i do now ? 
yes i 'm very clean .   did they find anything at my apartment ? 
thank you .   poor baby .   i think i should put him down now . 
how about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby . 
really ?   and how would we handle the sleeping arrangements ? 
peter this is very nice but you do n't have to do any of this you know . 
it was full of this awful pink ooze . 
peter what about the bathtub ? 
i do n't know what to do anymore . 
i must be losing my mind .   at the museum today i could have sworn that terrible painting of vigo looked right at me . 
peter the bathtub tried to eat oscar . 
i 'm sorry .   were you on your way out ? 
good - bye peter . 
he was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman . i hate this painting .   i 've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage . 
i 'm sure you did n't come here just to talk about art . 
i did n't paint it .   i 'm just cleaning it . it 's an original ver meer .   it 's worth about ten million dollars . 
oh hello peter . 
good luck . 
you mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug ? 
please do n't say that .   you wo n't go to prison . 
i wish i could stay .   i feel personally responsible for you being here . 
that 's where the buggy stopped . 
we definitely had a moment or two . 
i 'll do it . 
peter this is serious .   i need to know if you think there 's anything unusual about him . 
his name is oscar . 
what do you think ? 
i have .   that 's why i did n't call you first . 
hello peter . 
maybe we should discuss this somewhere else . 
peter do you think maybe i have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things . 
a little to the left .   right there !   that 's where it stopped . 
hi egon . 
hi ray .   it 's good to see you .   thanks for coming . 
you 're very brave louis .   good luck . 
i 'm not sure this is such a good idea ?   do they know you 're doing this ? 
i do n't think we should leave her alone . 
motherhood is a very natural instinct for me .   i 'd like to have a baby myself . would n't you ? 
you 're really good with children louis .   i can tell .   why do n't you come here and sit with me ? 
it 's really not a bad place .   it just needs a woman 's touch . 
i ca n't believe a person could actually live like this . 
i 'd like to but i told dr. venkman i 'd babysit .   do you want to babysit with me ? 
well good night louis . 
that 's very practical .   i hate going out on new year 's eve too . 
have you made any plans yet ?   you know tomorrow is new year 's eve . 
why would you want to be a ghostbuster if you 're already an accountant ? 
what are you doing up here ? 
who are you going to call ? 
it 's that darn ghost again !   i do n't know what to do anymore .   he just wo n't leave us alone .   i guess we 'll just have to move . 
all right what happened to me ? 
oh sure .   i 'm getting used to this . 
i am zuul . 
fine louis .   we 'll stop in for a drink . 
well actually louis i have a friend coming by . 
hi louis . 
i thought i turned it off .   i guess i forgot . 
oh that 's nice louis .   i 'll stop by if i 'm around . 
no thanks louis .   i 'm really tired .   i 've been rehearsing all morning . 
are you sick louis ? 
hi louis . 
talk to my accountant . 
thank you .   next time i want to break a lease i 'll know who to call . 
really !   is it gone ? 
there is no dana .   i am zuul . 
i am zuul .   i am ... 
i want you inside me . 
take me now . 
do you want this body ? 
he is the destructor . 
we must prepare for the coming of gozer . 
i am zuul .   i am the gatekeeper . 
i 've got to go now . 
all right .   since you put it that way . 
i do n't think so .   i 'm busy thursday night . 
what 's he doing in my refrigerator . 
you must have gotten the last copy . 
ca n't you tell me now ? 
he is a very close friend .   do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment ? 
i know .   you 're quite a celebrity these days .   are you here because you have info ... about my case ? 
most people ca n't hear me with the whole orchestra playing .   you 're good . 
you heard it ? 
all right . 
then leave . 
i 'll scream . 
that 's it .   get out . 
all right .   what do you want to do ? 
thanks .   coming from you that really means a lot to me . 
this is terrible .   either there 's a monster in my kitchen or i 'm completely crazy . 
are you all right ? 
i told you i ... 
i 'll wait here if you do n't mind . 
uh - huh . 
like a used car salesman . 
you really do n't act like a scientist . 
that 's a violin concerto . 
really ?   do you have a favorite piece ? 
no .   if i moved out now i 'd be acknowledging that what happened was real .   i 'm not ready to do that . 
no just that one word -- zuul -- but i have no idea what it means . 
is that your professional opinion ? 
why would anyone make up a thing like that ? 
... and then i opened the door again but it was gone .   there was nothing there . 
barrett .   dana barrett . 
yes ... well ... i 'm not sure .   what i have to say may sound a little ... unusual . 
you would have had a full scale revolt on your hands . 
do you want posters too ? 
not yet dear brother ... 
you want control of the crowd -- you ca n't get it by killing their hero . 
you ca n't do that ... listen to the mood of the crowd . 
if i ever loved narcissus it was n't like you want . 
what are you talking about ? 
the fans of narcissus .   they were on vigil outside the school of proximo . they believe he 's dying . 
why are you so surly -- you 've won brother .   the people have bread and the city is quiet . 
taking my pleasure .   do i need to clear my lovers with you ? 
you 're coming back ? 
you ca n't do that !   you came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you . 
why not do it in the colosseum ? 
if i may be so bold ... 
commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father .   except that he ca n't heave out his ghost . 
those are priceless sculptures . 
no one in rome has ever heard of him .   do you want to remind those few in the senate who have ?   the whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with .   forget about him . 
i 'm sure i do n't know . 
if you get me pregnant with a boy he 'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne . 
maybe you should get married .   pick one of your cousins it would demonstrate a profound stability . 
do n't you think you should at least wave ? 
and caesar !   let 's not forget to serve caesar ! 
i was suddenly thinking about going to bed . 
i 'm tired of being stuck in that wagon . 
that 's what you told me two days ago ! 
where are we now commodus ?   can you see the camp ?   my gods !   the air is turning into ice ! 
hidden .   where my brother can not place hands on them .   he did n't have the guts to watch them die so ... i took care of it all .   the sooner he is put out of our misery the sooner will they be safe . 
narcissus i have your family . they 're alive .   all of them . 
marcus would have lived but ... was poisoned by his son . 
you can not die . 
do you remember your epictetus that little homily we recited when we were children ?   the one that was supposed to remind us we were romans ? 
for the sake of the gods you 're not leading these men ?   how like my father you are .   you ' believe ' ... i guess that 's why you 're still alive . 
but you do exist .   narcissus :   hero of the battle of the danube . 
i came here to see that you stay alive .   the people need a living breathing alternative to commodus a hero . 
it 's my brother 's neck you want not mine . 
of course i know -- who do you think is paying for it ?   the emperor himself did n't you know ?   why do you think commodus came rushing up to the front ?   burning patriotism ? filial love ?   he wants to be sure when he takes over there 's enough cash left in the treasury to ... play emperor .   watch out for him narcissus ; he 's inexperienced but ... be careful . 
how do you know i am playing ?   well the clown is always harmless .   is n't that right ?   and how did you ever get to know me so well ?   the last we spent any time together i was fourteen .   i think you know me better than my father .   he 's going to die is n't he ? 
why do you keep playing at being so humble ?   it 's a little embarrassing . 
without him .   he 'd be weeping if he overheard that .   well ?   the idea of you as my adopted brother is very ... exciting . 
i thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities . 
you know our two most senior senators :   gaius cantus and falco verus ? 
narcissus !   terrified ?   you ?   the only thing he 's scared of is me . 
you teach them ! 
your daughters need more than some vapors ; they need you ! 
i do n't want you to die ! 
you 're not going !   you have to stay with us ! 
i do n't even want to imagine the things you 've seen ... 
i never knew a more idealistic man than you . 
let him trust quintus . 
we do n't need your help we 're doing great on our own . 
who else ?   i 'm the one who runs the estates while you 're here risking everything we have for the glory of rome !   or for the glory of you ! 
i 've been overseeing production myself for the past three years you 'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become . 
the battle is over .   the war is over .   you 've won ! 
you need to come home ! 
they 're studying with cynics . 
well you wanted the girls to have the best teachers . 
is n't the helmet magnificent ? 
maybe we are and maybe we are n't . 
he said he thought we 'd make a pretty good team . 
no benjamin . 
well -- i said i might marry him . 
carl smith . he 's a medical student . we 've known him for years . 
well -- i have to see carl first . 
why do n't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much ? 
i just do n't think it would ... 
i just do n't think it would work . 
benjamin -- i have n't even said i 'll marry you yet . 
i 'll think about it . 
i have to go back now . 
i do n't see how we can . 
i do n't know . i do n't know what 's happening . 
i do n't know . 
i might . 
i do n't know . 
will you kiss me ! 
i do n't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan . 
i do n't want you to leave tomorrow . 
well -- where are you going ? 
are you going home ? 
what are you going to do now ? 
the marble ? 
do n't you have it on ? 
what are you looking for ? 
can i just sit here while you 're packing ? 
benjamin when you came up here what did you think was going to happen between us ? 
benjamin -- this is my mother ! 
do n't tell me -- 
please let me go . 
then you took her upstairs and you raped her . 
she said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend . you waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night . 
i do n't feel well . 
let me go . 
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that . 
i do n't understand -- 
do you just hate everything ? how could you possibly rape my ... 
how could you do that benjamin ? 
well i want you to leave . 
i said i think it is . 
i think it is . 
is it because i 'm here ? 
no . i want to know why you 're here in berkeley ? 
i want to ask you a question . 
-- really incredible -- 
benjamin -- you 're -- i do n't know what to say -- you 're -- 
but you 're not enrolled . 
benjamin -- i would like to know what you 're doing here . 
i thought he said by the monkey house . 
i 've never been to it . 
at the zoo . 
i 'm meeting someone . 
get out of here . 
get out ! 
oh my god -- 
you mean the one who -- 
what is it ? 
because i want to know what 's happening . 
benjamin -- what 's happening ? 
what 's the matter ? 
benjamin -- i really do . 
i do . 
all right . 
i 'm glad . 
and it 's all over now . 
did they ever find out ? 
with a family ? 
was she married or something ? 
i 'm sorry . that is not my business . 
ben -- what 's happening ? who is mr. gladstone ? 
benjamin -- do they know you ? 
of course there is . look -- the veranda room -- right there . 
what is the matter ? 
is n't there one in the taft hotel ? 
where we going ? 
all right . 
is anything wrong ? 
we wo n't . let 's go inside . 
would you like to come in ? i could make some coffee . 
yes i do . 
no i could n't . 
oh -- that 's very nice of you to tell me . 
i want to go home . 
where is the car ? 
i think i 'd better go home now please . 
will you take me home now ? 
i do n't know . 
benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason ? 
why not ? 
are n't you eating ? 
i 'd love some . 
do you always drive like this ? 
are you going to graduate school ? 
do you know what you 're going to do ? 
you 're living at home now . is that right ? 
i 'll be there in an hour . 
give me an hour . 
did you get a room ? 
where are you ? 
where are you ? 
all right . put it in the room where we were . 
will you bring it in to me ? 
for god 's sake benjamin will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse ? 
benjamin -- i am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion . now if you wo n't do me a simple favor i do n't know what . 
could you bring it up ? 
i 'm in the bathroom . 
will you bring up my purse before you go ? 
i do n't think so . 
ahh . i do n't think you 'll have time for that drink after all . 
i 'm sorry we wo n't be able to invite you to the wedding benjamin but the arrangements have been so rushed -- 
i think we have everything quite under control now benjamin . would you like a quick drink before you go ? 
i 'll be with you in a moment benjamin .   will you send a police car to twelve hundred glenview road . we have a burgler here . just a second . i 'll ask him .   are you armed ?   no -- i do n't believe he is . thank you . 
hello . get me the police please . 
go home now . 
then you 'd better start believing me . 
in order to keep elaine away from you -- i am prepared to tell her everything . 
i can makes things quite unpleasant . 
listen to me very carefully benjamin . you are not to see elaine again . ever . those are my orders . is that clear ? 
do exactly what i say . 
drive down the block . 
but i am . i 'm extremely upset about it benjamin . 
benjamin -- i thought i made myself perfectly clear about this . 
thank you .   benjamin -- 
promise me benjamin . 
then give me your word you wo n't . 
thank you . 
may i stay then ? 
you do n't have to say that . 
but if it 's sickening for you -- 
that 's all right . i think i can understand why i 'm disgusting to you . 
if that 's how you feel -- 
well it 's pretty obvious you do n't want me around any more . 
of course i would n't . 
i did n't mean it . i do n't think you 'd be right for each other . but i would never say you were n't as good a person as she is . 
benjamin i want to apologize to you if that 's the impression you got . 
did i say that ? 
do n't you expect me to be a little hurt ? 
that i 'm a sick and disgusting person . 
are you ? 
i see . 
you 're not . 
i would n't know . 
let 's drop it . 
i have my reasons . 
do you understand that ? 
benjamin do n't you ever take that girl out . 
there 's nothing to tell . 
because i do n't want you to . 
do n't talk about elaine . 
that 's enough . 
it was a ford benjamin . 
oh my god . 
i do n't think we were the first . 
we 'd go to his car . 
benjamin what does it possibly matter ? 
how do you think . 
kind of . 
why are you asking me all this ? 
not particularly . 
all right . now let 's get to bed . 
are you shocked ? 
do n't tell elaine . 
think real hard benjamin . 
see if you can guess . 
i never did benjamin . now let 's -- 
is it ? 
i do n't . 
no benjamin . i do n't hate him . unhook my blouse . 
not exactly . 
we 've talked enough benjamin . 
is it ? 
on new year 's eve . sometimes on his birthday . 
now and then . he gets drunk a few times a year . 
about five years . 
no we do n't . 
we do n't . 
thank you . 
can i undress and talk at the same time ? 
calm down benjamin . 
the driveway 's on my side of the house . 
because he takes sleeping pills . he takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock . 
benjamin this is n't a very interesting topic . 
he 's asleep . 
i walk out . 
there is n't any . 
then i fixed supper for my husband and waited until -- 
i do n't remember . 
i got up . i ate breakfast and went shopping . during the afternoon i read a novel . 
do you want to hear it or not ? 
i got up . 
do you really want me to ? 
can i take off my clothes now ? 
i do n't . 
go ahead then . 
do n't you ? 
you start it off . i do n't know anything about it . 
how about art . 
do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences ? 
well what do you want to talk about ? 
are you tired of it ? 
well i just do n't think we have much to say to each other . 
if you want . 
-- of bring -- inadequate -- i mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way -- 
that you 're afraid -- 
on your first time -- 
it 's nothing to be ashamed of -- 
you can admit that ca n't you ? 
it is is n't it ? it is your first time . 
benjamin is this your first time ? 
are you afraid of me ? 
benjamin -- do you find me undesirable ? 
you what ? 
would this be easier for you in the dark ? 
thank you . 
either one will be fine . 
a hanger . 
will you bring me a hanger ? 
why do n't you watch ? 
i 'll get undressed now . is that all right ? 
thank you . 
the room number benjamin . i think you ought to tell me that . 
the number . 
is n't there something you want to tell me ? 
i 'll be up in five minutes . 
well -- do you want to go up first ? 
that 's fine . 
why do n't you get it . 
do you want to get it now ? 
do you want me to get it ? 
do you want to ? 
have you gotten us a room yet ? 
did you get us a room ? 
you do n't have to be so nervous you know . 
may i have a drink ? 
how are you ? 
may i sit down ? 
hello benjamin . 
thank you for taking me home . 
yes i do . 
because i find you very attractive and any time -- 
do you understand what i said ? 
if you wo n't sleep with me this time benjamin i want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we 'll make some kind of arrangement . 
benjamin -- i want you to know i 'm available to you . if you wo n't sleep with me this time -- 
i want to say something first . 
do n't be nervous . 
on that chair in the hall . 
i really do n't want to put this on again . wo n't you bring it up ? 
is that what you 're trying to tell me ? 
would you like me to seduce you ? 
why is it ? 
benjamin -- i 'm not trying to seduce you . i wish you 'd -- 
i do n't see why . i 'm twice as old as you are . how could anyone think -- 
do n't you think he trusts us together ? 
what if he did ? 
have n't you ever seen anybody in a slip before ? 
then why do you keep running away ? 
what are you so scared of ? 
thank you . 
come on . 
benjamin -- you 've known me all your life . 
if you still think i 'm trying to seduce you -- 
wo n't you unzip my dress ? 
i think i 'll go to bed . 
will you unzip my dress ? 
we had it done last christmas . would you like to see it ? 
have you ever seen elaine 's portrait ? 
we 'll forget it right now . finish your drink . 
all right . now finish your drink . 
sit down . 
it 's all right . 
why no . i had n't thought of it . i feel rather flattered that you -- 
well i do n't know . 
like what ? 
what 's wrong ? 
my husband will be back quite late . 
sit down benjamin . 
did you know that ? 
did you know i was an alcoholic ? 
you 've known me nearly all of your life . you must have formed some opinion . 
what do you think of me ? 
i 'm very neurotic . 
i do n't know . 
please wait till my husband gets home . 
benjamin -- i 'm sorry to be this way but i do n't want to be alone in this house . 
what do you drink ? 
what do you drink ? bourbon ? 
would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch . i feel funny about coming into a dark house . 
because i do n't feel safe until i get the lights on . 
i want you to come in till i get the lights on . 
will you come in please ? 
thank you . 
my husband took the car . will you drive me home ? 
will you take me home ? 
benjamin i want to ask you something . 
in general . 
whatever it is you 're upset about . 
is it a girl ? 
oh -- i forgot . the track star does n't smoke . 
is there an ashtray in here ? 
how are you benjamin ? 
oh . i guess this is n't the bathroom is it ? 
yes i can . 
benjamin -- where are you ? 
when did you two talk this over ? 
well -- when did you decide all this ? 
they do n't know ? 
oh ben -- this is so -- exciting -- 
-- then i 'll simply invite all the robinsons ' over for dinner on thursday . 
do n't go on like this . now if benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out -- 
it 's pretty embarrassing . i really do n't know what to tell mr. robinson . it 's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up elaine . 
goodnight benjamin . 
but i do n't want you to make up something . 
not if you do n't want to . 
because i know you do n't drive around for twelve hours . 
benjamin i 'm not going to pry into your affairs but i 'd rather you did n't say anything at all than be dishonest . goodnight benjamin . 
well this is your business benjamin .   if you -- 
then what do you do ? do you meet someone ? 
well you do n't drive around from midnight until noon the next day benjamin . 
what else ? 
you do n't have to tell me if you do n't want . 
well i 'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night . 
benjamin ? i 'm going to ask you something but you do n't have to tell me if you do n't want . 
can i talk to you a minute ? 
say hello to mrs. robinson benjamin . 
i do n't believe it . 
what 's happening ? 
they came all the way from tarzana . 
the carlsons ' are here . 
is anything wrong ? 
and baron thanks so much for everything . 
yes -- oh ! 
for tonight . 
looking for my room -- one sixty- six . 
anything for you . 
oh -- there 's no real thing -- it does n't exist . 
you 're not a bit like you were yesterday . 
yes -- i 'd love to . 
i 'll do anything for you . 
that was lovely . 
you were very different yesterday . 
chasing what ? 
i 'd given you up . 
all right . we 'll dance . 
of course . 
you 're very funny -- 
where downstairs ? 
tomorrow ? what time tomorrow ? 
are n't you ? 
did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on ? -- one that she 'd bought herself ? 
very little . 
money -- ever heard of it ? 
no -- why ? -- should i ? 
tea would spoil my dinner .   one meal a day i 'd hate to spoil it . 
dictation .   you know ... 
oh -- work ! ! 
have you seen it ? 
you 're a fool ! 
not with strangers . 
how do you know there is a grand hotel ? 
am i ! 
you 're a good man mr. kringelein -- a very good man . 
oh yes of course . 
nonsense ! we 'll find a great doctor he 'll cure you . they can cure anything these days . 
yes -- to paris ? i wanted to go there always . 
you do n't understand that do you ? 
i did n't like preysing right off . 
perhaps he really was a burglar -- but they do n't kill a man for that . 
oh -- i was thinking -- poor baron -- lying there his eyes so open . 
quick -- something awful -- awful has happened . go -- go at once -- mr. preysing -- 
quick -- mr. kringelein . 
please -- please ! 
you dance splendidly . 
you 're trembling . 
you must look at my face and not at the floor . 
dance then ? 
oh -- you would ! 
a man might what ? 
you like music ? 
no - absinthe . 
mr. kringelein -- how you have changed you look so nice . 
good evening mr. kringelein -- where 's the baron ? 
to take dictation -- a mr. preysing --   goodbye you -- tomorrow at five o'clock . 
i 'm engaged for the evening . 
her master 's voice !   i must go now -- goodbye -- thanks . 
silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are too . 
you are funny . you speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch . 
have caviar if you like but it tastes like herring to me . 
it 's not funny at all . one ca n't get intimate just off hand . i could go to england with you and everything like that -- supposing i met you next year and i said : ' how do you do mr. preysing ! and you said :   ' that was the young lady who was my secretary in manchester ' . 
i could n't do that you 're a stranger to me . 
oh no . 
oh -- careful mr. preysing . 
here hold up ! 
you think so ? 
i had to arrange about the trip . 
well he 's a gentleman ! 
you mean baron von gaigern ? 
oh yes . 
a thousand marks -- 
wait -- i must figure it up .   first i 'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it 's cold in england in march i 'll need a suit ... you 'd want me to look nice ? 
i understand perfectly . 
well -- you want me ? 
oh yes mr. preysing ? 
now children no fighting -- save that for the office . let 's have our dance . 
do you gentlemen know each other mr. kringelein -- mr. preysing -- baron von gaigern . 
tomorrow morning . 
come and dance with me mr. kringelein . 
presently mr. preysing . 
oh -- too bad . did you quarrel ? 
is that mrs. preysing . 
how nice -- your daughters ? 
... weight into the balance ... 
cotton company -- 
i understand you perfectly . 
you 're a little too fast . 
not too quickly . 
moreover -- do you mind if i smoke ?   i went to florence once too . 
only in mutual advantages -- moreover ... 
yes ... a man i know took me to switzerland last month ... 
that 's from skiing . 
only in mutual advantages -- moreover . 
i got ten marks for that . 
yes i photograph very well . look -- 
i do n't see why it 's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well -- seems so silly . i do n't know why they do n't like girls like me in offices . personally i hate offices -- i 'd much rather be in the movies . 
you pay me . 
no -- only occasional jobs . 
i 'm the stenographer . 
till then . 
on the train ? 
i 'm worried about you . 
they 've brought me such good luck -- you -- 
why do you think -- 
are you coming to the theatre ? oh -- i shall dance tonight -- how i shall dance -- i want to feel that you are in the theatre . 
do n't do anything foolish -- i 'm alarmed about you . 
you must go now . be careful on your way to your room . 
six twenty - seven in the morning ... but the money ? 
i 'll give you what you need -- i have money . 
why later ? 
ca n't -- ca n't you -- could n't you come too -- i think it would be better -- for us -- for us both . 
very early in the morning . 
suzette will be back here any minute . 
shall i see you again ? 
suzette will be back here in a minute . 
yes -- if i did n't believe that i 'd die after last night . 
yes -- yes -- yes . 
and now ? 
but now you must go ... i give you the pearls . but now you must go --- 
i 'll not denounce you . 
you may keep the pearls -- i do n't want them any more -- i 'll make you a present of them . 
what is the matter ? 
that 's a silly joke . 
oh ! what a picture -- and what else ? 
and what do you do -- now ? 
flix . -- and how do you live ? what kind of a person are you ? 
oh -- i was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest no stopping . we were drilled like little soldiers -- we danced in the school of the imperial ballet in st. petersburg . i was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- no rest no stopping . and then -- i became famous and whoever is famous is alone ... but why should i be telling you this ? last night i did not know you at all -- who are you really ? -- i do not even know your name . 
i want to be alone . 
what can you see ? 
why do you smile ? 
i see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing . you take pleasure in coming into a woman 's bedroom and you come . you take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony so you do it ... and what is your pleasure now ? 
the stage frays one 's nerves ... the discipline -- it 's so exacting . discipline means doing what you do n't want to do and take no pleasure in doing . do you know what i mean ? have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline ? 
just for a minute then . 
i want to be alone -- 
i want to be alone . 
i think you must go now -- the key is on the floor . 
grusinskaya ... oh -- oh if you knew how i slaved and slaved for grusinskaya -- for the success of grusinskaya -- for the triumph of grusinskaya ... and what is she now ? just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- are you listening to me -- do you understand ? -- i want you to understand . 
you could love me . it is so long since i have heard that word . nobody has loved me for a long time . it is so icy - cold to be famous . one is so cruelly alone . how is it that you -- let me look at you . your hands . your eyes . why could you love me ? 
go away . who are you -- ? 
he disappeared . later he was found dead . 
not quite strange now . it is as if i had been expecting you . you know once when the grand duke was alive i found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer -- 
strange man ... 
alone . all alone .   oh you strange -- strange creature . 
yes -- tired ... 
and -- and -- 
and then -- ? 
why do you look at me like that ? 
so you feel like coming into a lady 's room -- and you come ... what now ? 
nerves -- just nerves . you must forgive me . i have had a bad evening . i am very tired . do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence ? 
i was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that .   no . i am not afraid . it is strange . 
because you love me -- you love me ? 
why do you hide in my room ? 
what do you want here ? 
where is pimenov ? where is pimenov ? 
goodnight suzette . 
in the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral . laurels and tube - roses .   oh think suzette -- the villa and the sun at tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we 'll have a guest suzette . 
i 've done my hair differently -- do you like that ? 
five minutes suzette come back in five minutes . i 'll ring . 
oh yes suzette . 
good morning suzette . 
all right suzette -- quickly -- hurry . 
send it away -- i sha n't need it . 
oh suzette -- suzette -- sshh -- quiet . 
the pearls wo n't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- i hate them ! 
now is the time to cancel to stop entirely . i feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough . 
let us cancel the engagement . 
i ca n't dance tonight -- 
always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance .   i think suzette i have never been so tired in my life .   veronal did n't even help me to sleep . 
i know -- i know -- but it will be sunny in tremezzo . we 'll have a guest then . 
oh the sun -- it will be sunny in tremezzo -- 
wait a minute . i 've got to ask myself . 
i wish to be alone . 
hurry suzette . 
take them back suzette . 
suzette -- i told you not to bring the pearls . i will not wear them tonight . 
oh -- but it ca n't be . 
the house is not full -- is it really full ? 
i 'm cancelling the engagement . 
but when did he go ? how do you know ? 
yes pimenov .   one minute suzette i will call you . 
good morning pimenov . 
that theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- i was frantic -- i finished -- the last beat and ...   ... i waited -- i listened -- but the applause did n't come -- nothing . a man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed pimenov . we are dead -- it 's finished . 
last night ? ... there was no applause . 
it is not stage fright -- it 's something more -- 
the performance -- the performance -- the performance . 
madam it is mr. meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs . 
yes madam . and now madam will sleep . it is not long ' till the train . 
when a lady falls in love she does her hair differently . 
madam should sleep . 
yes madam suzette knows all about it . 
madam will dress now it is late . 
madam has slept well ? 
good morning madam . 
oh come madam -- please come . 
ah oui -- the car is here for madam . 
orchids come again madam -- no card -- i think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us . last night for instance -- 
mon dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break -- 
but madam . can not do that . 
it will pass -- it will pass -- come . 
madam grusinskaya 's car is to be brought . 
i will . so long bobo . 
well you can tell them i said they 're right .   i better get going . roy'll wonder where i am . 
you know i like that suit bobo . i do n't know what there is about it but it somehow makes you look taller . 
or else he 's working an angle . if he does n't steal a little he 's steeling big . 
a person that do n't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else . he 's a liability right bobo ? 
oh well you know . i just clip a buck here and a buck there . not enough to notice . 
he 's a good kid . a salesman . 
gee i better not if it 's okay . i still got ta drive back up to los ang - gleez . 
oh thanks bobo . 
permanent damage . 
it can louse up your insides . you can get puh puh puh ... 
you hit a person with the oranges in the towel they get big awful looking bruises but they do n't really get hurt not if you do it right . it 's for working scams against insurance companies . 
you mean the insurance frammis ? 
you 're calling the shots . 
it 'll never happen again . i swear . 
i never fucked up before bobo . 
he left home a long time ago . he was in the hospital up in los ang gleez real sick . 
my son was in the hospital -- 
my son -- 
bobo no i -- 
i want to keep my teeth . 
i was down on that horse bobo . not as much as i should have been but there was a lot of action on those-- 
i 'm not getting away with anything bobo . 
well i guess so . you 're the guy i work for . 
hi bobo . 
and i 'll want to leave an early wake - up call . 
sounds perfect . i can park my car back there ? 
do you have something around back facing away from the road ? 
i 'm a very light sleeper traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night . 
good evening . i 'd like a single for tonight . 
come on kid let 's see if there 's any food in the house . 
i like you too . 
roy ? he 's always crying . 
my son will be all right . if he is n't i 'll have you killed . 
you know who i work for . 
well make it stop ! 
what ? he 's going to be all right ! 
maybe i 'll swing around los ang gleez on the way . 
i know . 
delmar ? i never go out to california . that 's a thousand miles from here . 
is there nothing i can do roy nothing at -- 
i have to have that money roy . what do i have to do to get it ? 
roy ... what if i told you i was n't really your mother ? that we were n't related ? 
) that 's what it is is n't it ? keep me down . your turn to be in charge have the power . 
a future . the only future i 've got . 
and that 's why you 've got to get rid of this money . if you keep it around it 'll just make you think how clever you are . it 'll be a temptation to get back into the game . 
sure sure that does n't count . that 's different . 
well i guess i got it wrong then . seems to me i heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him . 
if you stayed a crook do you think you 'd live to be my ripe age ? 
that 's good . you do n't really belong on this side of the fence you know . 
you 're getting off the grift ? 
i gave you your life twice . i 'm asking you to give me mine once . i need the money . 
and making you feel bad at the same time huh ? but that 's the way i am you know the way i 've always been . always picking on poor little roy . 
no i guess not . it was pretty lousy of me i guess to be a child at the same time you were . not to stop being a child just because i had a child . i guess i was a real stinker not to be a grown - up when you needed a grown - up . 
i wonder did you ever think about it from my side . 
a bad mother . by any standards . i 've thought about it you know from your side since then . i know just how bad i was . 
oh really ? you 've got a legitimate complaint roy i do n't deny that . i was n't a very good mother when you were a kid . 
i know what 's bugging you of course . 
you do n't know what i 'd do roy . you have no idea . to live . 
i 'll get it . 
no but i 'm goddamn thirsty . ice water ? 
you want a drink ? 
and to survive my way i need money . bobo knows about the stash in the car so i did n't dare touch it not if lilly dillon 's dead . so that leaves this . 
bobo is n't after you ! bobo 's after me and he 's goddamn good ! but so am i. i 'm a survivor roy . i survive . 
roy that 's fine but i do n't have time for this . bobo -- 
roy i know what to do with myself ! it 's a big world out there . 
a job ? i 've never had a legit job in my life ! 
at what ? 
her credit cards . how far am i gon na get with that ? 
just a few bucks . 
i need this roy . i ca n't run without money and if i ca n't run i 'm dead . 
i 'm sorry . i hated to take your money but -- 
it is is n't it ? and maybe it 's a break for me after all . i 've been wanting out of the racket for years and now i 'm out . i can make a clean start and -- 
i sat in there with her i thought what do i do now ? run and i 've got bobo and the law after me . stay and how do i explain ? 
as though you do what i say . 
no you would n't . that 's what she was after though . but why hit on me ? 
she must have been the one that blew me off with bobo . i guess to get me running . did you tell her about my stash ? 
bobo wo n't be . he 'll spend the money to make sure . 
not for long . not when they do a fingerprint check . 
i 've really got to -- 
oh yeah ? is the frame holding ? 
somewhere else that 's for sure . 
well sure roy . you want me to drive up -- ? okay fine come on down .   it wo n't be a home - cooked meal you know . 
you too roy . 
after the meet . back to baltimore . 
i thought ... i was hoping we could play it straight with one another . 
no can do . have to dip in and out of my bag too much . besides it 'll heal in the air . 
no . that was the point . 
you do ? 
roy i do n't want money from you . 
what 's that ? 
if you come out to the track do n't know me . 
roy ! what are you doing in san diego ? 
i just give you your life . what you do with it is up to you . 
you do n't have the stomach for it . 
get off the grift roy . 
you do if you 're where i am . where you want to be . how 'd you get that punch in the stomach roy ? 
he let me live . he let me be his friend . 
i sent bobo ten grand of my own money like it was the winnings from my bets . i hoped that would cover me .   it did n't . 
that was my choice nothing to do with you . i took a chance and it did n't work out . 
the first day of the delmar meet there was a nag called bluebell . i should have been on it . but that was the day after you came in here so i stuck around to see how you were gon na be . 
my boss is a guy named bobo justus back in baltimore . when a long shot gets too much action i have to put money on that horse at the track because it 's the only way to get the odds down . 
no . and you have to be . 
that 's me . that 's who i am . you were never cut out for the rackets roy and if you -- 
you do not ! roy dillon ? cornball clown pictures ? commission salesman ? it 's all a front is n't it ? you 're on the grift i know you are . you 're working some angle and do n't tell me you 're not because i wrote the book ! 
and that dump you live in ! those clown pictures on the walls ! 
stop kidding me ! four years in a town like los ang - gleez and a peanut selling job is the best you can do ? you expect me to believe that ? 
whatever you say . the manager says your boss called .   really pulled the wool over everybody 's eyes huh ? 
just a little accident . i went by your place picked up your mall . just bills i 'll take care of them . 
you always did . 
do n't mention it . 
well ... you 're all right now i guess . i have to get down to the track . 
i 'm working down in san diego . just for a few weeks .   thought i 'd drop in on my long - lost son . 
only one tooth ? 
only one arm ? 
so what 's your story today ? 
oh cole please . please come out of it . what would i do without you ? 
it 's just the strain again the stress . we 'll take a vacation . 
cole it 'll be all right . honey ? 
henry no ! 
we 're not really interested henry . 
oh henry no that 's just boring . 
so here we are ! 
oh i know i know and you 've been wonderful since i was widowed . but mister hebbing has--   -- you do n't mind my telling him darling --   -- suffered reverses . if he could ... 
henry next time could n't mister hebbing -- 
well of course not ! i know how dangerous this is . but i would trust mister hebbing with anything .   would n't i darling ? 
oh i told mister hebbing all about it how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients ! 
you are seeing it . you 're looking right at it . 
i have only one thing now . are you interested ? 
it 's not your fault . 
all right . 
it was a gift . it is n't worth anything at all ? 
but they must be ! they cut glass ! 
what is ? 
but what 's wrong ? 
why ? what 's wrong ? 
we 'll work something out joe . 
i 'll have it tonight . nine o'clock ? ten ? 
joe could we talk it over ? do you want a drink ? 
joe you know you 'll -- 
joe i thought i was gon na be all right by now i just need a little more -- 
you heard the shower did n't you ? 
i 'm wise to you i should have seen it before you rotten son of a bitch . how is it huh ? how do you like -- 
do n't act so goddamned innocent ! you and your own mother gah ! you like to go back where you been huh ? 
sure it is . that 's why you act so funny around each other . 
by god it 's your mother . it 's lilly . 
what is it ? what 's going on ? 
for christ 's sake why not ? 
no ! because i -- 
you 're too good for the small - time roy . move up to where there 's big dough to be made and you do n't have to stick your neck out every day . 
but the setup 's there . it 's there now . 
i called a fellow i know in tulsa the one who plays my chauffeur . there 's a sucker there he says is made for us . and a boroker that just shut down we can use their office not change a thing ! now i can scrape up ten grand without much trouble . that leaves fifteen or twenty for your end . we could start this weekend get the sucker into position -- 
you mean it would be too tough to give me a turndown here . easier on home grounds . 
but why not ? i thought it was settled . what 's holding you back ? 
you and me roy . what a team we 'll make . we think alike ; we get along together . once or twice a year we take some slob the rest of the time we live like this . you wo n't regret this roy . 
i 'm well connected roy cole introduced me to a lot of people . very valuable . valuable for us . 
i 'm not trying to make trouble roy . it 's just she 's always so nasty to me i thought who is she to be so high and mighty . i saw her out there and i called a friend of mine in baltimore so now i know who she is . 
i saw her . 
i went out to delmar . 
) if you could have seen your face when i told you good night ! you looked so so ... ah ! 
open it and find out . 
open your door . 
you do n't mind really do you roy ? it 's been such a wonderful evening i guess i just wore myself out . 
separate bathrooms darling . i will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over . 
think about it . okay ? 
not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks . but how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand ? 
i need a partner roy . i need an inside man and you 're it . you could be as wonderful as cole . 
join up with you ! i watched you roy i 've been watching you wondering if i should talk about this at all or maybe just ... 
he retired . 
oh roy it was great ! we were rolling in dough lived wherever we wanted only pulled two or three scams a year . 
no no ! he never calls the cops not after we give him the blow - off . 
no no roy just cash poor . they had savings accounts stocks to sell houses to mortgage . sell their wife 's jewelry . oh they had a lot of money when they put their minds to it . or when i put their minds to it . i stayed with them that 's the roper 's job made them get up every penny they could raise turn it all over to cole . 
he 'd explain he had to have cash so there would n't be any paper trail for the sec . and a lot of cash or it was n't worth while . the least we ever took was forty thousand and the most was one hundred eighty - five thousand dollars ! from one sucker ! 
he did n't think they were risks . he was so good roy he could just play with the mark . 
it is roy ! and now right now it 's the perfect time the best time since i 've been in the game . 
it was beautiful . and getting better all the time . 
i was teamed ten years with the best in the business . cole langley . 
the long end . big con . 
roy you 're a short - con operator . and a good one i think . do n't talk to me like i 'm another square . 
you 're on the grift . same as me . 
the tap . what you do for a living . 
oh come on roy . 
i watched you . working the tap on those soldier boys . 
you already went back to work . 
i 'll sign that affidavit . 
big spender . 
what if we want to drive somewhere while we 're there ? 
i do n't see why we have to take the train . 
i 'll see you when you get home . 
get well soon . 
you 're a mama 's boy if you want the truth . 
and you never defend me . you 're afraid of her . 
i do n't like to come here roy . every time i do your mother comes in and makes remarks . 
who else is paying for all this ? you badmouth the woman all the time but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you . 
you 're just comfortable that 's all . you do n't even ask to go home . you just lie around let your mama take care of you . 
i do n't see why you 're still here . you look healthy to me . 
i want to know everything about you . 
well no roy . your mother found you . 
you were bleeding inside honey . remember that bruise you had ? 
no baby . come to mama . 
i did n't say that . you are n't marriage material . 
no more than this ? 
roy ? it this all we have ? 
look at me . 
are you sure ? 
you are n't taking me for granted are you ? 
well well . in a real hurry are we ? 
well i can assure you it wo n't happen again .   thanks for your concern .   goodbye . 
i never stop thinking about it detective .   the only way in or out of this school is through that gate and it is secured at all times . 
... i think it would be best if you both left . 
i 'd prefer you did n't .   i 'm very busy . 
do i know you ? 
think eddie had something to do with it ? 
do you know who did this ? 
my god ... 
a dead body ? 
bruce ... what 's going on ?   the kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival . 
that would work . 
call me laurie will ya ? 
please get on the bus ... 
john you ca n't help her now . 
just get on the bus . 
get on the bus . 
where are you going ? 
i was trying to protect you from this ... 
afraid not .   you can pick your friends but you ca n't pick your family . 
i was trying to get away from someone . 
will sit down ... 
oh so now it 's my fault ? 
it 's an option . 
wrong .   there are rules in this house and you 're going to follow them whether you like it or not . 
you 're kidding with that answer right ? 
shit john !   what the hell were you doing out there ? ! 
i know . 
i thought you 'd never ask . 
where are you going ? 
i took the padlock off your door . what more do you want ? 
my point exactly .   see we both agree . 
forget it . 
you 're father thinks it 's okay to run off to cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top .   somehow his opinion does n't count . 
betcha ' did n't predict that . 
who ? ! 
okay tell you what ... you can still be the school r.a. but no dance tomorrow night . 
molly of all the people ... if i ca n't trust my resident assistant then what ? 
we 've got to get these kids out of here ... 
i 'm gon na head back to the office ... finish up some things . 
not a real fan of halloween humor will . 
are you going to leave too ? 
shit happens . 
no will this is n't the alcohol talking .   it 's the truth . 
he 's my brother . 
michael meyers . 
my name has n't always been keri tate .   it was once laurie strode . 
there 's something i have to tell you both .   it 's going to sound strange ... 
i 'm fine .   i just need to lie down ... 
bye will . 
i 'm going into town ... run a few errands before dark .   need anything ? 
oh please ... you get that out of a fortune cookie ? 
it 's not going to happen . 
he 's been living out of moving boxes for three months . 
it 's always john . 
nothing a good stiff drink ca n't fix . 
looks great .   it does . 
do it norbert . 
norbert -- you come too .   let him go harold .   let him go . 
you 've killed women ? 
then listen to me .   you 're both disgusting -- with your pride your pride .   i hate you for coming here -- like a federal marshal in a western film . i loved you when you stayed away . but here you are now -- high noon in the superbowl !   you fool you fool . 
all right !   am i exceedingly dangerous now ? 
how do i load ? 
there it is .   give it to me . 
where 's the bullet ? 
i mean it ! 
i want you to get out of here norbert .   harold -- i want you to sit down in the chair and not lift a finger until norbert is gone . 
i 'm turning off the alarm .   i 'm turning off everything . 
no we wo n't .   no matter how it begins it will end in death . because it always does .   is n't that always how it ends harold -- in death ? 
this is suicide .   go get the police . 
i 'm going to call the police . 
i do n't know .   i hope he never hunts .   i hope he never kills another human being . 
the old heroes are going to have to get used to this harold -- the new heroes who refuse to fight . they 're trying to save the planet . there 's no time for battle no point to battle anymore . 
it 's still just death the absence of life -- no honor at all .   it 's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness .   to you though it 's the honor that crowns them all . 
but it 's all balled up in your head with death .   the highest honor is death .   when you talk of these animals one by one you do n't just talk of killing them .   you honored them with death .   harold -- it is not honor to be killed . 
honor i suppose . 
no you do n't . 
so he can kill you .   you hate your own life that much .   you beg for a hero to kill you . 
that 's really what you want .   you become furious when people wo n't make you dead . 
you 're begging him to kill you ? 
he 's a child ! 
like what ? 
sounds quite beautiful . 
blue soup ? 
it seems highly intelligent to me . 
he 's afraid of you harold .   he knew you 'd want to fight him .   he does n't know anything about fighting .   he hates pain . 
he 's in east st. louis with his mother -- visiting an aunt . 
how unhappy he 's going to be -- alone in his room . 
i see . 
i want you to tell me that you loved me once . 
just one favor . 
almost a christmas scene . 
you feel i 've done a dreadful thing -- leaving him ? 
he had hoped that someone would be playing it still -- two hundred years from now . 
two hundred years old . 
he cried . 
he knows you shattered his violin . 
unless she has nerve . 
did you like it dear ? 
a dozen ? 
you took him to the funeral i hear . 
i came for paul as well . 
i rang .   it seemed like the proper door for a servile worthless organism to use . 
i came for my clothes . 
because if you do -- i'll leave you . harold   goodbye . 
no you 're not ! 
what are you going to do ? 
i do n't think so . 
his most cherished possession ?   his violin i guess . 
i learned a lot of things in college .   actually -- it was norbert who told me that . 
and they have very mixed feelings about women .   they hate them in a way .   one reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently .   they can scrog them as you say--   for revenge . 
well -- part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long and make awful messes while they 're there . 
it 's complicated and i do n't want to go into it now because it 's bound to sound insulting -- even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted .   it 's just the truth . 
the whole concept of heroism -- and its sexual roots . 
well i can .   some injuries spiritual or physical can be excruciating to me .   i 'm not a silly carhop any more .   maybe you 're right about fish . when i was a carhop i did n't feel much more than a fish would .   but i 've been sensitized .   i have ideas now -- and solid information .   i know a lot more now -- and a lot of it has to do with you . 
i 'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish -- along with yours . 
i will not be scrogged .   i remember one time i saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers and you promised me that the fish could n't feel . 
this is not a coy deception .   i do not want to be scrogged .   i want love .   i want tenderness . 
i do not wish to be scrogged -- ever . i never heard that word but when i heard it i knew it was one thing i never wanted to have happen to me . 
i -- i was wondering -- is there anything you should n't eat -- because of jungle fever ? 
they do n't have to feel like slaves . 
you leave me so -- so without-- without dignity . 
people do n't use that word any more . 
we 're all going to have to go out for breakfast .   the cook quit yesterday . 
you 're wrong . 
what a honeymoon . 
that is the most heartless statement i ever heard pass between human lips . 
mrs. wheeler is dead . 
i have some change ! 
i have a brain . 
you should n't have talked to norbert that way . 
turn around ? 
just -- bang -- we have a honeymoon . 
it 's so -- so stark . 
he has n't had breakfast yet . 
a trip you mean ? 
i did ? 
ghastly cruel unnecessary . 
do say hello to your mother . 
awful .   i ca n't tell you how sorry i am . 
he does n't deserve this !   you do n't know him .   it is n't fair ! 
i 'm so glad you like each other .   i was so scared so scared . 
thank god ! 
you know what i want ?   i want you both to be friends .   i know you both respect you both . you should be friends . 
paul said you were awfully sick . 
should n't you lie down ? 
he 's a very decent man harold . 
we thought it was an emergency . 
we thought a doctor might help . 
you 'd better get dr. woodly . 
every fuse in my nervous system has been blown . 
well -- enjoy the natural honest unrehearsed result -- surgical shock . 
a telegram -- a phone call might have helped . 
i do n't know .   this is a new disease to me . 
we adjust to what there is to adjust to .   perhaps paul being young can adjust to joy or grief immediately .   i hope he can .   i will take a little longer .   i 'll be as quick as i can . 
give us time harold -- to adjust to your being alive . 
give us time . 
not at all . 
how do you do ? 
some kind of animal ? 
what do you do for a living ? 
this is crazy . 
you do n't even know me . 
i 'm engaged . 
i 'm sorry sir i 'm engaged to be married .   my boyfriend would be mad if i went out with another man . 
yes sir .   it was a very unusual automobile . it was a cadillac but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be .   and what to drink ? 
eighteen--   and a half . 
can i help you sir ? 
how do you do .   my name is penelope ryan .   this is a simple - minded play about men who enjoy killing -- and those who do n't . 
what will you do colonel ? 
and you colonel ?   let me guess : you do n't know . 
how horrible . 
what happened ? 
who 's dead ? 
for what ? 
alice is dead ? 
she married an accountant named stanley kestenbaum . 
you did n't even find that out ? 
alice got married again . 
and you went home unannounced too ? 
thank you .   you can leave now .   we 'll begin . 
you do n't know ? 
colonel harper retired now dropped an atom bomb on nagasaki during the second world war killing seventy - four thousand people in a flash . 
then get him . 
it is an emergency is n't it ? 
what does he say to do ? 
what are his symptoms ? 
that 's why i 'm crying . 
it is you is n't it harold ? 
there stands the loins from which you 've sprung . 
that man is your father . 
for heaven 's sakes ! 
what 's his name ? 
then who flushed the toilet ? 
is norbert still here ? 
yes he is . 
who have you been talking to ? 
where will you be ? 
i hate that thing . 
i do n't really know . 
a lot of people do n't . 
norbert was just beginning practice . a real man would have sold her to a catfood company i suppose .   as far as that goes j. edgar hoover still lives with his mother . 
in a railroad accident many years ago . 
you know she has no feet !   you want him to abandon his mother who has no husband who has no money of her own who has no feet ? 
not true . 
that 's an interesting piece of news . 
a what kind of doctor ? 
thank you kind sir . 
not even mutual of omaha thinks so anymore . 
he 's a ghost ! 
i know . 
i told you this was a simple - minded play . 
and this is my son paul .   he was only four years old when his father disappeared . 
you and harold are friends ? 
it 's true . 
you were wonderful . 
i 'm saying no -- and thank you . 
thank you herb .   you 're a wonderful man .   you really are . everybody respects you for what you 've done for scouting and the little league . 
i 'm sorry . 
a week .   we were waiting for the right time to-- 
what 's the matter now ? 
what was it ? 
we 've got to find him .   i want you to show me exactly where you saw him last .   and you stay here norbert in case he comes home .   that 's all he said -- the thing about the key ? 
did you talk to paul ? 
how nice . 
a what ? 
you figure ! 
the park ! 
is he coming home ? 
is he all right ? 
did you see him ? 
what then ? 
seven jaguars ' skins i 'm told . harold shot every one .   shall we go ? 
gentlemen !   is this right for a fight ?   it 's been so long . 
good night . 
i see . 
i 'm touched . 
this conversation took place incidentally about three months before harold was declared legally dead . 
i do n't want to go to vanderbilt . 
i know . 
i 'm glad . 
that 's something i suppose . 
or was .   we have n't done anything wrong you know . 
doing what ? 
i 'll get ready herb .   i did n't expect you this soon .   please -- won't everybody be nice to everybody else while i 'm gone ? 
do it ! 
you fake !   you 're no better than the dumbest general in the pentagon .   you 're not going to beat harold . you 're not going to beat anybody . you 're not going to stay here either -- yammering and taunting until you 're most gloriously killed . go home ! 
you fool you fool . 
get out of here . 
tell her to have a nice trip . 
i believe in miracles now . 
how neat .   how keen . 
you know each other ? 
he 'd go to a movie .   i think that 's what he 'd do .   if i were sure he was in a movie i could stop worrying .   we could have him paged . 
it 's a jungle out there . 
he 's not your son . 
we 've got to rescue him . 
paul 's only twelve years old . 
and maybe paul .   what about the murderers ?   they 're in there ! 
i 'm amazed . 
why would you do that ? 
it 's suicide ! 
no !   oh no !   three people murdered in there in the last six weeks ! the police wo n't even go in there any more . 
he told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was . he made eagle scout when he was twenty - nine years old .   oh norbert -- promise me that paul has not gone into the park ! 
it 's an experimental model .   he does n't dare leave it in his car for fear it will fall into the hands of competition . 
that 's the xke . 
as long as he keeps out of the park . 
it is ? 
i never knew when to hold it -- or who to ask or what to say . 
they made her so sleepy she could n't work . 
the animals made her sneeze and cry too much . 
she quit this afternoon . 
we made the date three months ago . 
herb shuttle is taking me to a fight . 
would you like to say something about killing colonel ? 
wait a minute that 's going to cost you more than forty bucks . 
look i do n't know anybody . i never seen her before . 
that 's cool . 
now what do you want ? 
what do you want to tip me for ? look you got to spell it out . whatever you want just say it . 
sure . what do you want ? tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars . 
look that twenty dollars you just paid i do n't get any of that . that goes to the guys that own this place . i get two bucks an hour minus ten percent for a bail fund . i make all my money on tips . 
are you going to stiff me ? 
cops are n't allowed to do that either . a judge ruled that that was entrapment . do n't ask me why . i guess he figured the sight of a vice officer 's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself . 
pull out your cock . 
i have to ask you that . if you were vice you could n't deny it . you ought to dress less square . you would n't get hassled so much . here let me help you get that tie off . 
you 're not vice are you ?   do you work for the los angeles police department or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency ? 
sit down . make yourself comfortable . my name 's felice . 
you 're still dressed ? 
do you have any particular choice of girl ? 
you may do that in the privacy of your room . 
do you want to take a session ? 
we offer female wrestling that is nude body to body contact with a girl of your choice in a private room . twenty dollars a half hour thirty dollars hour . any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room . tipping is permitted . we accept bank americard master charge and american express . 
but then you 'll forget about me . 
i ca n't tell you that . 
what happened ? 
did you find out where she was ? 
so i guess we 're both fucked huh ? but at least you get to go to heaven . i do n't get shit . 
my man . ' pimp . ' i split 'cause he do n't treat me for shit . thinks he 's so cool 'cause he 's black . i once tried to take my clothes but he says ' you ca n't take 'em 'cause they 're my clothes -- i bought 'em . ' yeah with my fucking money ... 
do n't get upset . i lied too . i do n't make no five hundred dollars a week . everything i make goes to granville . 
just a guess . did you have it good with your wife ? you know sex . 
she left you right ? 
just a guess . she ai n't dead though is she ? 
you wife is n't dead is she ? 
i would n't expect too much . i mean about her coming back . once a girl gets into the life . 
look i really do n't know your daughter but ... 
on your own land ? 
do you live in a house back in wherever . 
i know what you mean . after a while they all look the same . 
just a second . it 's my ass i 'm risking . you better do it my way . these fuckers do n't mess around . 
rot in hell honey .   he 's busy now . 
tod'll meet you at the bookstore at eddy and o'farrell tomorrow noon . i told him you were a ' specialty ' customer . 
it does n't make any sense to me . 
if you see anything from the inside it makes sense . you ought to hear perverts talk . a guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me . 
i thought i was fucked up . 
you really believe all that ? 
wow . then why be good ? either you 're saved or you ai n't . 
so it 's already worked out . the fix is in ? 
wait wait . i 'm trying to figure this out . this is like rona barrett . before you become saved god already knows who you are ? 
no please go on . 
yeah yeah go on . 
what the crap ? 
do they believe in reincarnation ? i believe in reincarnation . 
you have to believe in something . what do they believe in -- the whatjamacillit church ? 
he deals in pain . 
tod was .   he was with ratan . 
what do you care about ? 
we 're just alike . you think sex is so unimportant you do n't do it . i think sex is so unimportant i do n't care who i do it with . 
how important do you think sex is ? 
neither am i. 
why ? are you a sex fiend ? 
do n't knock it . a girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money . then you 're free . you can go off to europe meet somebody get married . my girlfriend 's going to buy her own beauty parlor . not me . i 'm gon na travel . ' keep movin ' that 's my motto .   would you rather work at copper penny at a dollar - eighty an hour having every two - bit cocksucker able to yell at you ? i can make more money suc ... doing what i do for five minutes than i can all week at another job . 
no . but does it make any difference ?   how did you get to be the way you are ? 
did you ever live in a room with six people and you did n't have any money any food any furniture ? have your brother come out his car break down he ca n't get a job ? your friends stealing food going through trash behind a supermarket ? 
you do n't understand shit . 
' sucking off . ' 
you never met a working girl before have you ? you think i like sucking off guys all night ? maybe i do . so what ?   you ca n't even say it can you ? 
what rate ? 
at least i 'm a growing person . 
hey do n't worry about it . your daughter 's around . we 'll find her in a couple days . 
and your wife ? where 's she ? 
of joanne 's ? 
i did n't think so . i 've fucked detectives . who are you ? 
you 're not a private detective either are you ? 
you do n't drink ? 
you have anything to drink ? you want to go out and get something ? 
i thought you were going to bed ? 
this is different . this is nine hundred dollars . 
when do we start ? 
make it nine hundred . that was my best week . 
up front ? 
this is just temporary . i once made nine hundred in outcall . 
here ? what a joke . there was some detective asking about that girl . 
are you a private detective ? 
you 're not a film producer are you ? 
last i heard he went to san diego . 
tod might know . 
no . i saw her with tod . 
got any parts ? i 'm free . not free- free but you know free . i do n't really do this . 
you making a feature ? 
do i know you ? were n't you on the set the other night ? with ramada . 
it 's your money . you talk . 
too bad . i was n't in it . 
sure . like in mikey and niki . did you see that picture ? 
well next time you talk to him tell him to pay his actresses more . 
she thinks so .   what do you do ? 
you kidding ? three days work . i finish tonight . 
jake'll take care of me . 
i ai n't ever gon na see him again anyway . 
you can fuck off too . 
well he can just fuck himself . 
who 's that ? 
my name ai n't niki . it 's pattica like in attica . 
was he with a girl ? 
i 'm still in l.a. but i 'm looking for tod . i heard he was around . 
you remember me . louise ? rhymes with squeeze . 
because if you are ... 
i suppose they are in the truck . are you going to take a lot of time with this ? 
well i do n't know . do you know harold ? 
oh no ! not in < u > my</u > name . 
oh do n't get officious . you 're not yourself when you 're officious . that 's the curse of a government job . 
officer i can explain . 
we planted it . 
but there is a family resemblance . 
oh well . must have been your brother . 
have n't we met before ? 
all right then and we 'll be off .   nice chatting with you . 
well it 's not really mine . i dug it up in front of the courthouse . we 're transplanting it . letting it breathe you know . but of course we would like to get it into soil as soon as possible . 
yes . you see i have to plant my tree . 
no no . i just took it . 
i just do n't think we have one unless it 's in the glove compartment . could you look harold ? 
about forty - five minutes would n't you say harold ? we were hoping to start sooner but you see it 's rather hard to find a truck . 
i do n't have one . i do n't believe in them . 
oh i do n't have one . 
yes . those little pieces of paper with your picture on it ? 
well not < u > dying</u > actually . i 'm changing . you know like from winter to spring . of course it is a big step to take . 
chardin . dame marjorie . but you may call me maude . 
oh ! that 's wonderful harold . go - and love some more . 
oh harold do n't upset yourself so . 
i feel giddy . 
i thought eighty was a good round number . 
but harold we begin to die as soon as we are born . what is so strange about death ? it 's no surprise . it 's part of life . it 's change . 
oh harold ! what a fuss this is .   so unnecessary . 
oh yes dear . i took the pills an hour ago . i should be gone by midnight . 
why yes . it 's my eightieth birthday . 
oh i am happy harold . ecstatically happy . i could n't imagine a lovelier farewell . 
oh harold . 
oh you 've thought of everything . and champagne . 
oh harold . you are so young . 
i was remembering how much this meant to me . it was after the war ... i had nothing ... except my life . how different i was then - and yet how the same . 
harold that picture is almost twenty - five years old . 
they mocked me . they were representations of people i dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me and that in time all i would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs ! so i tossed them out . my memory fades i know . but i prefer pictures made by me with feeling and not by kodak with silver nitrate . 
i took them out . 
- end where i began . 
oh no . but i should have liked to have been an astronaut . a private astronaut able to just go out and explore . like the men who sailed with magellan i want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world .   what a joke it will be if like them i - 
we < u > are</u > alone - you and me and everybody . but we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in china is looking at them too . someone we do n't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us . and the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star - gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there . we are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely . 
i do n't know . perhaps . 
yes . they 're old friends . 
well they 're my species . 
right on ! it would n't be a celebration without it . 
scared ? swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours . i was petrified . 
no . it had nothing on this afternoon . 
give me that .   i 'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs . 
do n't you advance on me . 
do n't you talk to me like that you little foul mouth degenerate !   really sir i thought that you at least ... 
what ? with your skill and my experience ... i think we can come up with something . 
they 'd put you in jail eh ? well historically you 'd be in very good company .   that 's what my husband used to say when we were in the french underground dealing with the gestapo . would you like to do a little raking ?   work i 'm told done with no selfish interest purifies the mind . you sink your separate self and become one with the universal self . on the other hand senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided . 
really . just put it there harold . 
well do n't go . 
but they ca n't do that . you have n't even got the vote . 
what is it harold ? 
well be kind . i 've lived a long time harold seen evil as well as good and it has been my experience that kindness ... 
oh harold . you make me feel like a schoolgirl . 
from the guys who got the matches of course . 
no . i feel more like - yodeling . 
harold everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves . you just ca n't let the world judge you too much . 
well why do n't you ? 
with life . 
pray ? no .   i communicate . 
spreckled with uncountable stars . the stars are shining right now . we just ca n't see them . just another instance of all that 's going on that is beyond human perception . 
it 's so blue . 
i like you harold .   come i 'll teach you to waltz . 
of course . 
how ingenious ! tell me about them . 
what was that ? 
well --   - they say he was very wise so i 'm sure he must have . 
it 's all right .   it 's organic . 
yes so do i. but i think he is a little ... old - fashioned . like a puff harold ? 
why ? there 'll be a new block of ice in the morning . 
yes . it 's almost there . 
oh those motorcycles are awfully chilly . 
i suppose i did .   well farewell little tree . grow up tall and change and fall to replenish the earth . is n't it wonderful harold ? all around us . living things . 
the old double u - turn . gets them every time . 
is he ? ah the police . always wanting to play games . well here goes . 
do n't play anything ! dear me . everyone should be able to make some music . why it 's life ! - rhythm and harmony - that 's the cosmic dance . come with me . 
oh that was fun . let 's play something together . 
oh come on . i 'll teach you . 
oh yes ! every day . but i do n't need a defense anymore . i embrace ! still fighting for the big issues but now in my small individual way . shall we have a song ? 
oh big issues . liberty . rights . justice . kings died and kingdoms fell . i do n't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but i do miss the kings . when i was a little girl i was taken to the palace in vienna to a garden party . i can still see the sunshine the parasols and the flashing uniforms of the young officers . i thought then i would marry a soldier .   later frederick would chide me about it .   he was so serious . a doctor at the university . and in the government . 
my umbrella ?   oh that 's just a relic . i found it when i was packing to come to america . it used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition .   a long time ago . 
some nuts ? some licorice ? it has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait . 
oh it 's all right . it 's organic . 
a little after - dinner liqueur harold ? 
he 's never finished one yet . he has around him every kind of hand tool known to man but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake . 
an ice sculpture . it 's venus - the goddess of love the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream . 
we 'll come back in the morning . 
he 's fallen asleep as usual . 
oh my . we 're too late . 
yes you 're right . we 'll go see glaucus . come on . 
why not ? 
we 'll transplant it . to the forest . 
look at it harold . it 's suffocating . it 's the smog . people can live with it but it gives trees asthma . they ca n't breathe . see the leaves are all brown . harold we 've got to do something about this life . 
that little tree . it 's in trouble . come on . 
over there by the courthouse . 
the universal language of mankind .   what music do you like harold ? 
oh it 's only a machine harold . it 's not as if it were < u > alive</u > like a horse or a camel . we may live in a machine age but i simply ca n't treat them as equals .   of course the age has its advantages . 
oooh but they are not . look . 
why do you say that ? 
i should like to change into a sunflower most of all . they are so < u > tall</u > and simple . and you harold what flower would you like to be ? 
well it 's all very thrilling of course but i ask you harold ... is it enough ? 
sterling silver . it was my dear mother - in - law 's part of a dinner set of fifty pieces . it 's one of the few things that survived .   oh but i do rattle on so . tell me about yourself harold .   what do you do when you are n't visiting funerals ? 
that 's the influence of the right food the right exercise and the right breathing .   greet the dawn with the breath of fire !   of course there 's no doubt the body is giving out . i 'm well into autumn . i 'll have to be giving it all up after saturday . sweeten the tea with honey harold . it 's delicious . 
me . ha ! did i tell you i 'll be eighty on saturday ? 
wonderful ! try something new each day . after all we 're given life to find it out . it does n't last forever . 
here we are harold . oat straw tea and ginger pie . 
no you have to touch it .   you have to run your hands over it get close to it really reach out and feel . you try it . 
what do you think ? 
it goes on and on . 
now i 'll pump it up ...   ... and you just turn the handles .   okay . what do you smell ? 
really . do you think it 's wrong ? 
heavens no ! i do n't have the time . but i like to keep in practice and poor glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form .   do you disapprove ? 
she seemed yare to me . 
i 'll heat some up . my it 's nice to see you again harold . how 's your hearse ? 
how about some ginger pie ? 
my door is always open . 
well then you must come back and visit . 
oh at the dentist 's ? 
well then . 
but it 's oat straw tea . you 've never had oat straw tea have you ? 
she 's very sweet but so old- fashioned . please sit down harold . i 'll put on the kettle and we 'll have a nice hot cup of tea . 
oh look ! the birds . 
it 's all memorabilia but incidental and not integral if you know what i mean . 
well if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things then i 'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - i 'm sort of breaking it easy -- here today gone tomorrow so do n't get attached to < u > things</u > . now with that in mind i 'm not against collecting stuff ... 
not < u > any</u > car . i like to keep a variety . i 'm always looking for the new experience like this one . i liked it . 
of course i 've had to make some additions for the new models but not as many as you might think . once you have your basic set it 's then only a question of variation . 
your hearse ? 
well it 's a new experience for me .   good on curves . shall i take you home harold ? 
oh so do i. they 're such fun are n't they ? it 's all change . all revolving . burials and births . the end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -   - the great circle of life . my this old thing handles well . ever drive a hearse harold ? 
no .   i thought not . 
do you sing and dance ? 
do you dance ? 
well then i must be off .   we shall have to meet again . 
can i drop you anywhere harold ? 
oh thank you . i think we shall be great friends do n't you ? 
how do you do ? i am dame marjorie chardin but you may call me maude . 
oh of course . what is your name ? 
it 's a question of emphasis you might say . accentuate the positive so to speak . 
i mean seventy - five is too early but at eighty - five well you 're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon . 
me neither . i heard he was eighty years old . i 'll be eighty next week . a good time to move on do n't you think ? 
you 're welcome .   did you know him ? 
where 's my father ? 
what 's happening ? 
not much . 
you can keep them . 
stay the fuck away from me . 
no . that was n't the deal . 
i could lead you right to him . you could take him back to hell instead of me . 
he did . i 've seen him . 
to a man called frank cotton ? 
you did this before right ? 
let me alone will you ? 
this is n't for real . 
well i did n't mean to open that thing . you can go back wherever you came from . 
who are you ? 
it 's just a puzzle box . 
oh christ . 
i do n't remember . 
please listen to me -- 
it 's important . 
i have to speak to my father . 
you bastard -- 
oh my god . 
this is n't happening . 
you want it ? 
this is n't happening . 
do n't touch me . or so help me -- 
oh my god . 
i saw everything . 
i was here this afternoon . 
i have to see my father . 
where 's daddy ? 
what happened ? 
which is where ? 
hi . i got soaked . 
you would n't believe me . 
i called another friend of mine and he 's coming over . will you let him in ? 
my father does n't answer . i have to go find him . 
who brought me in here ? 
wait a moment -- 
what happened to me ? 
i have to get out . 
it is n't . i know what 's going on here and it is n't over -- 
please . you 're in danger . 
get the fuck out of here . 
i want to see . 
i do n't believe it . 
no . you do n't understand . your brother -- frank -- he 's here in the house . and he 's -- 
i have to talk to you . 
she 's not like mom . she 's ... i do n't know ... moody . i thought that was what you liked about her . 
maybe you should give it some time . 
i love you too . 
i just wanted to be sure you were o.k. 
i 've forgotten . 
o.k. i 'll be nice . you get on with the muscle work . i 'll make myself some coffee . 
is julia here ? 
me like . 
big house . 
i will . see you . 
take care dad . 
of course . every day . 
i 'll come over and see you in the next few days . you can show me the mansion . o.k. ?

kirsty ? it 's very late . 
the keys are in the kitchen . 
just an accident . he 's all right . will you drive ? he needs stitches . 
just to your left . 
there 's a towel in the bathroom .

just feeling a bit sick . 
i 'm here . 
would you excuse me ? i think i 'm going to go to bed . 
no you wo n't . 
you 're done worse . 
take it slowly . 
no you 're not . 
it 's probably going to need stitches . 
let me see . 
you 're not going to faint . 
is it deep ? 
what have you done ? 
it looks like a bomb 's dropped . 
why not ? 
he 's here ? 
in here . 
no argument . 
all right . 
no . i 'm not . 
you mean we 're moving in ? 
i thought half of it was your brother 's ? 
not exactly modern . 
why did n't he want to sell it ? 
how long since you were here ? 
it smells damp . 
just a thought -- 
maybe somebody changed the lock . 
we 're going to freeze to death . 
what 's wrong ? 
am i ? 
maybe i will . 
why do n't you take off your jacket ? you 're warm . 
that 's right . 
i prefer the floor . 
we do n't need a bed do we ? 
that 's right . 
let 's keep it that way shall we ? 
do you care ? 
no . no . let 's go upstairs . 
i ... suppose so yes . 
you want something to drink ? 
there 's a first time for everything . 
that depends . 
just soda . 
not much . 
what are you talking about ? 
where 's rob ? 
hey barry . 
no .   no .   mom wants you to come to the funeral .   it 's on friday . 
nothing to resolve ian .   let 's get a drink . 
mmmm no .   not a good idea . 
i 'm upset but i 'm fine . 
yeah i 'm fine .   i 'm off the phone . 
i am fine ...   i got ta go .   goodbye . 
it 's gon na be fine .   these people are ready for anything . 
well you 've asked . 
i mean maybe you 're right .   but were you really expecting me to say yes ? 
i 've changed my mind .   that 's the most romantic thing i 've ever heard . i do .   i will . 
about what ? 
no .   i do n't think so .   i 'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days . fair enough ? 
very persuasive . 
do n't sulk .   what brought all this on ? 
no .   probably not . 
well forgive me if i do n't think of you as the world 's safest bet . 
i 'm sorry .   but two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for the reader were n't you ? 
i know . 
ha ha ha .   hoo hoo hoo . 
what are you going to talk to me about ? 
are you going to talk to me or shall i get my paper out ? 
are you worried about tomorrow night ? 
that 's okay .   you seem pissed off all the time though . 
we took care of that . 
they 'll go on early .   nobody will even be there yet and i told them they ca n't play for more than a half hour . 
yeah .   his band is playing a set . 
barry said its done . 
what do you ever do that ca n't be cancelled ? 
i had that idea when i was living with ian and it was such a good idea that i was annoyed we were n't together anymore .   it might even be why i came back . 
just local of course . 
i called dan koretzky because he -- 
i tricked you into meeting some people you 'd think were great .   i thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a tina turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way . 
i know .   but you 've never met .   it just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him . 
at paul and miranda 's .   paul from work . 
wanna go to dinner ? 
hi .   what are you doing ? 
all i 'm saying is you have to allow for things to happen to people most of all to yourself .   otherwise what 's the use ? 
how ?   what would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice ? 
yeah you 're alright .   but you 're certainly not happy .   so what happens if you get happy ?   and yes i know that 's the title of an elvis costello album i use the reference deliberately to catch your attention . should we split up because i 'm used to you being miserable ?   what happens if you i do n't know start you 're own record label and it 's a success ? time for a new girlfriend ? 
less neurotic .   are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life ? 
more confident maybe . 
i ca n't go to work with my hair dyed pink .   and i can afford to go shopping more now and i 've met a couple people i like over the last year or so . 
you have n't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years i 've known you .   if we 've grown apart then i 'm the one who 's done the growing and all i 've done is change jobs . 
but what ? 
because i 'm not allowed to .   i still do after work .   so what ?   should we just break up ?   is that what you 're saying ?   because if you are i 'm going to run out of patience . 
how ?   how were we the same people ? 
money does not matter .   i do not care how much you earn .   i 'd just like you to be a little happier in your work but beyond that you can do what you like . 
i 'll pay for you .   even though you owe me money .   we have to do something with the money i earn .   i need to . i deserve it .   you can just think of it as winning the lottery . 
... like mexico .   or jamaica .   or new york even . 
look rob .   if great sex was as important as you think it is and if i was having great sex with him then we would n't be lying here now . and that is my last word on the subject okay ? 
to make you feel better . 
well i was gon na lie and now i ca n't because you 'd know i was lying . 
look we 're okay now .   we just had a nice time .   let 's leave it at that . 
what 's the difference ? 
it was like sex .   what else could it be like ? 
want to know what exactly ? 
let 's go home .   okay ? 
i know it 's not very romantic but there will be romance again at some stage i 'm sure .   i just ... i need you rob .   that 's it .   and we know each other and we care for each other and you 've made it clear that you want me back so ... 
ray 's a disaster .   i do n't know what that was all about except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade i guess and blow it all apart . 
everything 's too hard .   maybe another time i would have the guts to be on my own but not now i do n't . 
i 'm too tired not to go out with you . 
i lived with you .   you were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you 're worried i might kill you and you 're entitled to worry .   is n't that a terrible thing ?   is n't that sad ? 
yes of course .   there 's nothing to worry about . 
oh rob we 're not going to go through that again . 
i knew there was a reason i wore a skirt today . 
hello .   it does n't seem so long ago that i looked at you from here . 
it 'll have to be sex then . 
i want to feel something else than this .   it 's either that or i go home and put my hand in the fire .   unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm . 
i do n't know .   sometime .   later . listen rob would you have sex with me ? 
c'm on . 
i do n't want to go back . 
i did n't mess things up because i was scared .   i slept with ray because i was sick of you .   and i needed something to snap me out of it . 
thank you .   i appreciate it .   i ca n't reciprocate . 
you 're also an idiot . 
you 're soaking . 
are you going to lie in that flower bed all night ? 
liz'll give you a lift .   she knows where to go and everything ... i do n't have time to talk rob .   i 've got too much to do . 
look are you coming or not ? 
i do n't care .   as long as you do n't expect me to hold your hand . 
my dad liked you .   and mom never told him we 'd split because he was n't up to it and ... oh i do n't know .   i do n't really understand it .   i think she thinks he 'll be able to see what 's going on .   it 's like ...   he 's been through so much what with dying and everything that she does n't want to upset him any more than she has to . 
in a minute .   when i get it together . 
i 'm sorry . 
my dad died .   my dad my dad . 
pig died . 
i ca n't talk right now . 
well think about it . 
you 're being deliberately obtuse . 
i 'm sorry to go on about it .   but i do n't know there 's a lesson here somewhere and i want to make sure you get it . 
they 're not really though are they ? i know you bought them for me and that was really sweet of you but that was when you were trying to turn me into you .   i ca n't take them i know they 'd just sit around staring at me and i 'd feel embarrassed by them and ... they do n't fit in with the rest of what 's mine do you understand ?   that sting record you bought for me ... that was a present for me .   i like sting and you hate him .   but the rest of this stuff ...   who the hell is nick lowe ?   or gram parsons ?   or the boredoms ?   i do n't know these people .   i ... 
those are n't mine . 
oh ho so very infrequently . 
mmm hmm . 
you make me laugh much more than ray does if that 's what you 're getting at .   but i already knew you could make me laugh .   it 's everything else i do n't know about . 
ray .   i hate ian . 
you know i did n't mind .   and it 's not as if ray 's place is any better . 
fix it up .   it 'll make you feel better . 
you know what i mean . 
i do n't really want to talk about it to be honest . 
i 'm sure . 
he 's at home .   listen i ca n't believe he went to the store .   i 'm mortified actually .   i 'm really sorry .   he had no right to do that and i told him so . 
yep .   i might have missed some stuff . i 'm so used to some things being here that i do n't even notice them . 
i called and called but you were out .   i thought i 'd be gone before you got back . 
you do n't ever think about other people ? 
i 'm not experimenting .   why do n't you go experiment . 
jesus .   i do not know .   i 'll talk to you later . 
i 'm not -- hold on ... 
i figured it was .   where are you ? 
call me at work .   we can arrange to meet properly .   i do n't want this to be the last conversation we have .   i know what you 're like . 
will you call me ? 
we can meet for another drink if you want .   so i can explain it better . i owe you that much . 
and anyway i keep trying to tell you that 's not really the point is it ?   the point is we got ourselves into an awful mess rob ...   are you there ?   what are you thinking ? 
you must have known it would happen . you could n't have been entirely unprepared .   like you said i 've been living with the guy .   we were bound to get around to it sometime . 
i remember the song .   i just could n't remember who sang it . 
is that right ?   i 'd like a word with him . 
-- and who says i like marvin gaye anyway ? 
-- whatever and the israelis and the palestinians do n't .   art garfunkel and marvin gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute and the israelis and the palestinians are . art garfunkel and marvin gaye -- 
it 's not like saying that at all actually rob .   art garfunkel and marvin gaye make pop records -- 
yes .   well i 'm coming over to your house to get some things . 
i thought i could give you a lift back . 
i should be so lucky . 
we 've done the hard part now .   i might as well you know ... 
what 's his name ? 
nice friend . 
that 's five .   so .   why did you decide to deejay again ? 
well i would n't mind a quick chat if you got the time . 
fine .   that 's great . 
look if you ca n't think of anything it does n't matter .   i 'll do one .   my five favorite from the old days at the dodger . 
nevermind .   any five .   so four more . 
is there a difference ? 
your desert island top - five . 
yeah well ... let 's see ... what are you 're all - time top five records ? 
right .   so .   you must have an enormous record collection . 
so .   is now a good time ? 
i thought i would ask you a few questions if that 's okay . 
well i used to go to the dodger on your nights and i saw you 're doing it again and that your putting out a record and it 's sort of a then - and- now story against the backdrop of the chicago music scene with the emphasis on now . 
i 'm caroline fortis from the reader . i want to do a story on you . 
i 'm looking for deejay rob gordon . 
maybe i 've been a little unfair . but is this really the time ? 
enough of what ? 
no .   they do n't know him .   and ken liked you .   rob ken did n't die for your benefit you know .   it 's like everybody 's a supporting actor in the film of your life story . 
what difference does it make ? 
it 's a crematorium . 
to think i sympathized with you for two seconds !   poor rob !   laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs .   you let me believe that ! 
-- no no no do n't even .   i talked to laura rob .   i talked to her and she gave me a little background . and you 're a fucking asshole . 
yeah .   like i said i do n't want to take sides .   and i like laura with you .   she 's more fun more open . you guys are good together .   i just wish you two could i do n't know .   i do n't think much of this ian guy -- 
how 're you holding up ? 
you called this morning ? 
hey .   it 's liz . 
and so it is .   i 'll talk to you later . 
that way .   you ? 
god you ask a lot of questions . 
so you 'll stay ? 
jesus so much for delicacy .   i pegged you for a master of understatement beating around the bush and all that buzz . 
i 'd like it if you could stay the night . 
when i said before that i hoped it was n't the end of the evening i was you know ... talking about breakfast and stuff . 
tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees rob standing and holding his jacket . 
good .   in that case i 'll fix us something else to drink .   you sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee ? 
for now .   but i would n't be if i thought this was the end of the evening . 
are you okay ? 
you have n't even seen it ! 
the conformist . 
yeah i know the crumblers !   i bought a used blasters album in new york about ten years ago and somebody left a crumblers single in it .   my everything changed for a couple of weeks . 
yeah but if you heard this band called the crumblers you 'd -- 
no way !   i 'd cramp his style .   and i would n't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall .   i 'm way to unattached for that . 
thank you . 
everything go alright ? 
do n't you like that ? 
yup .   not far from here actually . 
good .   'cause i 'm enjoying myself . 
okay .   because you took the trouble to come up here .   and because you 've got principles .   but that 's it .   i 'm not selling them to you one by one . 
sure .   ten cents . 
with eleven hundred he could come home and that 's the last thing i want . 
and i wo n't take a penny over ninety . 
seventy - five . 
suit yourself .   there are plenty of others who will . 
that was n't part of the deal .   i want to be poisonous but fair . 
years .   this collection is as close as he 's ever come to an achievement . 
he 's in jamaica with a twenty - three- year - old .   a friend of my daughter 's . he had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and i told him to fuck off so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever i go minus a ten percent commission . which reminds me .   can you make sure you give me a five ?   i want to frame it and put it on the wall . 
i must have nothing .   their my husband 's . 
i know what they 're worth .   give me fifty and get them out . 
give me fifty bucks and they 're all yours . 
what do you think ? 
does n't have a head does he ? 
it 's my birthday . 
there was a count .   count dusan .   he would invite the local peasants to his chateau fill them full of wine then slice their bellies so he could reuse it .   the symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me . 
would you remember his name ? 
have you spoken to anyone else about this ? 
the boy _ died _ ? 
i do n't follow you . 
i 've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies . 
then you did n't know richard later on . 
no thank you i 'm fine . 
church hill that 's pretty close is n't it ? 
you owe me .   besides i 'm cute . 
so 's playing choo - choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of- 
you have lived forever . 
the inheritance . 
what is it ? 
what 's wrong ? 
will i see you again ? 
what is it you want ? 
but you 're known so much . history i 'll only read about . 
what is it like ?   being you ? 
damn you . 
do n't . 
is that a threat ? 
you kill with your left hand ? 
you and your buddy make a real team do n't you ?   exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between . 
what about that family in ' 31 ? 
you killed those other two . 
of bodies . 
that 's insane . 
what could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction . 
he knows about you . 
that 's why smith called you macleod . 
i 'd like you to try . 
who are you ? 
just a little crazy . 
my life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses .   i ca n't stand it .   but you 're different .   it 's in your hands .   a clarity . 
i 'm not even sure why . 
i 've been telling myself it 's the award winning journal article i 'm going to write .   but it 's not .   it 's you . 
i must be insane .   leaving work ditching cops .   all to follow a murderer .   a very old murderer but a murderer just the same . 
i hope i never get that old . 
it 's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people 's lives . 
that 's impossible . 
then you must be at least 70 years old . 
you 're using your son 's name . 
and you are william taupin are n't you ? 
william taupin seems to have left his mark . 
i do n't know any of these .   i 'll make a fool of myself . 
it 's beautiful . 
there 's a catch .   you 're supposed to wear 19th century clothing . 
i thought it might be a nice break from all of this . 
it 's some sort of party the town is throwing . 
well as long as we 're stuck here . 
no .   so what now ?   we just wait ? 
the estate stuff is pretty straight forward .   just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat . 
you want me to front for you . 
you make it all sound so simple . 
when you finish what then ? 
you did kill those men . 
what 's all that ? 
our cars were seen together in felton .   they 're calling me an accessory to murder . 
is this what you killed them with ? 
you 're wrong . 
no .   i had to talk to you . 
are you ? 
i 'm a historian mr. taupin . only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face . 
i 'd rather hear yours . 
i 'm a witness to a murder .   that seems to put me pretty high on your friend 's chop list . 
what about me ? 
he was innocent . 
i left a man dead in felton .   but you do n't really care do you ? 
what will you do now ? 
and you ? 
who is he ? 
dupont circle . 
he tried to kill me last night . 
what the hell is going on ? 
why not ? 
jesus christ . 
i have friends . 
i 've been to church hill . 
i think you do .   better yet i do n't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place . and i think mr. smith whoever he is now knows that . 
does carl smith ? 
grave robbers ? 
someone beat you . 
good reflexes . 
charming guy basil .   once after beating an army of serbians he blinded all but- 
it 's quite rare you know some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years . 
i 'd like to ask you about the claymore . 
very traditional . 
do you play ? 
now there 's a new topic . 
i 'm just curious . 
never take up poker detective . 
research .   if your pal was there i never saw him . 
what 's all of this got to do with me ? 
what makes you so sure he 's the one ? 
you 're an asshole moran . 
it 'll never stick . 
what are you getting at moran ? 
spare me the details . 
we 've got nothing to say . 
i 'm calling an attorney . 
what do you want from me ? 
you better have a warrant .   that 's my notebook you 've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it . 
who is it ? 
it 's bullshit .   everything . my job the people i get involved with i 'm up to here with it . 
some job .   card filing and cabinet dusting .   four years in this dump and i have n't written anything for wilson that a wounded yak could n't do . 
corey you _ owe _ me . 
i 'll take care of that corey but i need this now . 
all i need is for you to check the name . 
give it a rest ned huh ? 
someone should check him out . maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over .   he has one he might have two . 
i 've seen nobleman swords that were n't as well preserved .   it 's just a hunk of peasant iron .   why would he be carrying it around in an alley ? 
he 's too cool .   too sharp .   i think he 's got something to do with it . 
i do n't believe him . 
bensinger -- of the tribune . 
that 's bensinger . that 's his desk . 
who is it ? 
i 'm getting married tomorrow . 
no just a farewell appearance batting for sweeney . i 'm going into business for myself . 
ca n't you say ' hello ' to a fellow ? 
just a second walter . here bruce here 's the check ... and oh bruce here 's your wallet . i got it back . 
here it is bruce . one -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars . 
oh yes . here it is . 
no i was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly . 
oh -- mother -- she -- i do n't know where she went . 
out some place . 
oh she was here . 
bruce you know i 'm mad about you and stop talking like that .   walter ! 
we 'll explain the whole thing to them . 
bruce i know but i was in the biggest jam -- 
bruce ! ! how 'd you get out ? 
hello bruce ... 
well the story 's practically finished . i 'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger . 
no -- but i 'm sure it 'll be all right with walter . 
the criminal courts building . 
yes he is ... look bruce we 're taking that next train -- and when i say next train this time i mean it ! 
oh no . how could you ever think of such a thing ? 
i 'm sure you have n't any . 
yes was n't it ? 
the check bruce ! 
what 's the matter ? 
fine . and here 's a kiss for you . 
hildy johnson ... oh hello bruce . have you got it ? is it certified ? 
i 'll be careful darling . you be please . 
i know a lot of men who did n't do anything till they met walter burns . please dear . 
believe me bruce i know what i 'm doing . he 'd get you in a crap game -- 
on second thought would you let me have it ? i 'll get the tickets . 
wait a minute bruce . have you got that money ? 
better make that a certified check walter . 
according to the budget we laid out that 's more than our food bill for a whole year . listen bruce i do n't want walter burns to use me but i 'm perfectly willing to use him . how long will it take to get him examined ? 
and what 's the matter with a thousand dollars ? 
wait a minute bruce . what 's commission on a $ 100000.00 policy ? 
he certainly -- hic -- does ! 
no . it 's strong .   but i like it that way . 
that 's what he did to me . swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor . 
he comes by it naturally . his grandfather was a snake . 
you 're so nice bruce you think everybody else is . 
it will be perfectly all right walter . mother is coming with us on the train . 
i 'll come a - running pardner . 
my job bruce . i started it -- and i 'll finish it . 
do n't be embarrassed bruce . i heard it but i just wanted to hear it again . i can stand being spoiled a little . the gentleman i 'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling . 
i wo n't be more than ten minutes i promise you . 
you -- you ! ! 
sure heaven ! you 've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper ! 
yes -- ' hildy darling ' . i 'm just a fool . that 's what i am . i know what it 's going to be like . 
walter you ca n't do that ! 
you 're not fooling anybody . 
that 's what he said the last time . do n't believe him judge . 
well i 'd like to be lady - like and think it over . 
what 's the matter with my brains ? 
what would you do if it was a daughter ? 
niagara falls ! walter you do n't mean that ? 
well maybe i 'd like to know just once ! 
a fine honeymoon with a murderer right in the boudoir ! and that other honeymoon in a coal mine ! 
thanks walter but it 's no good . we tried it . 
it 's awfully clear now . bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace . i could n't do that for him walter . i 'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who 'd give up her soul for a story ! ... is that job still open ? 
on the nine o'clock train . that 's the one he took is n't it ? 
no he wo n't . i wired him that i was n't coming . 
yeah . only -- only i 'm not leaving walter . 
because i 'm a newspaper woman heaven help me ! 
do n't touch me ! i 'm not doing it for you ! 
what 's the difference ? i 'm going to write that story -- and you know it ! 
all right .   heads i go -- tails i stay to write the story . ready ? 
i do n't know what to do walter . 
yeah . i suppose i could . but walter -- 
well if it 's my last story i 'd like it to be a good one . but -- i guess i ca n't walter . 
that 's all right walter . it 's as much my fault as yours . 
do n't remind me . that 's how we happened to -- 
we sure did but we had to go in hiding for a week . 
yeah . what about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory ? six scoop interviews ! 
we 've certainly been in some swell jams . 
in a way . 
worried ! i was petrified . were n't you ? 
how was that for a tight squeeze ? 
just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment . 
who did you talk to ? 
hanging an innocent man to win an election ! 
wait a minute !   let go there ! 
no you do n't ! walter ! 
who says so ? i 'm going to the morgue -- to look -- 
i do n't care what you say . i 'm going to find bruce 's mother .   oh - h ...   i 'm going out and find her ! 
oh i see . i beg your pardon . 
hello -- hello ! is this the lying -- in hospital ? did you have an auto accident in the last -- 
ring that number will you ? 
lafayette two - one - hundred . 
shut up will you ?   you sure ? nobody ? 
hello max hildy johnson . was there an old lady -- ? 
is this the community hospital ? 
nobody ?   morningside three - one - two - four . 
hello -- eddie ? hildy johnson . was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup ? 
mission hospital ? gimme the receiving room . 
gimme western four - five - five - seven . 
louie where 'd it happen ? i 'm going out ! 
i 'm looking at you -- you murderer ! 
i killed her . i 'm responsible . oh- h ... what can i do now ? how can i ever face him ? oh i hope he never comes back ! 
what am i going to say to bruce ? what 'll i tell him ? 
do n't tell me -- was she killed ? 
what happened ? 
where 's mrs. baldwin ? 
bruce ought to be back by now . walter you 're not trying anything again are you ? 
i 'm finished . 
double - crossing swine ! 
is he coming back here ? 
what tickets ? 
where 's bruce ? 
where 's butch ? 
all right walter . 
okay walter . 
how about the time he had his house painted by the fire department ? 
can i call the mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous ? 
where 's some paper ? 
how much do you want on it ? 
you ca n't take that desk out . it 's crawling with cops outside . 
that one -- how you gon na take him ? they 'll see him . 
whoa -- wait a minute . we ca n't leave williams here . one of the other fellows'll -- 
let me get at that typewriter and i 'll show you how a doll - faced mugg can write ! 
i get it ! 
i 'd like to think . 
wait a minute -- was n't it stanley who discovered livingstone ? 
i know but -- 
oh get off that trapeze !   there 's your story ! smear it all over the front page -- earl williams caught by the morning post ! and take all the credit -- i covered your story for you and i got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now i 'm getting out ! i know i told you that twice before today -- but this time i mean it ! 
let go o ' me ! i 've got to get bruce out of jail ! oh walter why did you have to do this to me ? 
she jumped out of the window . 
walter ! d - did you see --   -- that ? 
it better be fifteen minutes because bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter 's clicking away to beat the band . 
no this is on the level walter . i 'm not good enough to make this one up . the sheriff gave his gun to the professor the professor gave it to earl and earl gave it right back to the professor -- right in the stomach ! who ? no egelhoffer was n't hurt badly . they took him to the county hospital where they 're afraid he 'll recover . 
well i 'm coming to it . it seems the professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it ? nobody else but that great thinker sheriff hartman ! 
well this expert dr. egelhoffer from new york decides to make williams re - enact the crime -- 
wait a minute . your mother 's alive . 
never mind it ? that 's not my money ! that 's bruce 's money ! 
it cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of cooley . 
no thanks i 've still got those . well i 'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the press room for the background on this yarn . it 'll be kind of fun to see the boys again too . remember bruce it must be certified . 
yes --- and that 's putting it mildly ! no certified check -- no story -- get me ? 
oh nothing ! of course you might cancel the check . yes ! wait a minute ! what would be his first payment on that policy ? 
you keep out of this . bruce suppose you examine mr. burns in his office . i 'll get my bag and go over to the press room in the criminal courts building . you phone me as soon as mr. burns has given you his check . then i 'll go get the interview and you phone mother that we 're taking the six o'clock train .   and no tricks walter ! 
we 're not interested . 
i happen to know sweeney was married only three months ago . if he 's got twins this morning i claim it was done with mirrors . 
well it 's either an act on your part or a miracle on sweeney 's . 
what a performance ! bravo ! do n't let him fool you bruce -- it 's only an act ! 
why walter you 're getting poetic ! 
no bruce dear . do n't you see ? this is a trick to get your sympathy . no walter i 've been waiting for something like this -- but i was n't sure when you 'd spring it . if you want to save earl williams ' life you can interview him yourself . you 're still a good reporter . bruce and i will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same . 
the colored vote happens to be very important to the mayor of this town . 
if he 's nuts why does n't the state just put him away ? 
you said it . 
what now ? 
thank you . 
i might have walter but you were never there . 
i suppose i ca n't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember it 's your last fling . 
allow me . 
and when he walks with a lady he waits for her ! 
and he takes his hat off when he 's with a lady . 
you would n't believe this walter but bruce holds the door open for me . 
now you got me . 
afraid ? i should say not ! 
oh better not walter . would n't do any good . 
well he 's waiting in the anteroom for me now . 
the quicker the better . well -- i finally got out what i came in to tell you .   so long walter and better luck next time . 
well i 'll give you a hint . by tomorrow they 'll be calling me mrs. bruce baldwin . 
i do n't know about water buffaloes but i know about him . he 's kind and sweet and considerate . he wants a home -- and children . 
well i can and i love it ! he forgets the office when he 's with me . he does n't treat me like an errand - boy -- he treats me like a woman . 
it 's a good honest business is n't it ? 
he 's in the insurance business . 
not what you 'd call rich . makes about five thousand a year . 
a journalist ! peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think hitler 's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen ! i know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets and for what ? so a million hired girls and motormen 's wives will know what 's going on ! no walter i 'm through . 
that 's why i 'm quitting . i want to go some place where i can be a woman . 
you ca n't sell me that walter . 
i tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing . i 'm getting married walter and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as i can get ! i 'm through . 
look at this ! 
i 'm not working for any other paper ! 
please ! will you just -- 
listen you bumble - headed baboon -- 
get away svengali . 
keep away -- 
well have n't you got anybody else ? 
sweeney ?   well after all he did n't do it on purpose did he ? 
what 's the matter ? 
you -- you -- 
i was n't satisfied ! i suppose i proposed to you ! 
well the paper'll have to learn to do without me . and so will you . it just did n't work out walter . 
listen walter -- 
you would n't have taken me if i had n't been doll - faced ! 
i know walter but i -- 
you bet i 've got a better offer . 
that 's the first time you 've been right today . that 's what i -- 
just what i said . that 's what i -- 
do n't tell me what to do ! we 're divorced -- i 'm a free woman . you 're not my husband and you 're not my boss ! and what 's more you 're not going to be my boss . 
no i ca n't . 
i have a lunch date . i just want -- 
walter you 're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way . now would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what i came up here for ? 
what ? ! ! 
well suppose we did ? that is n't what i got married for . what 's the good of -- look walter i came up here to tell you that you 'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it because i 'm -- 
all i know is that instead of two weeks in atlantic city with my bridegroom i spent two weeks in a coal mine with john kruptzky -- age sixty - three -- getting food and air out of a tube ! you do n't deny that . do you ? 
what home ? 
a fellow your age hiring an airplane to write :   ' hildy : do n't be hasty -- remember my dimple . walter . ! it held things up twenty minutes while the judge ran out to watch it . 
well why did you promise me you would n't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works ? 
i suppose that 's true in a way . i am fond of you walter . i often wish you were n't such a stinker . 
holy mackerel ! look walter that 's what divorces are for . 
done what ? 
i 'll always remember it . if i had n't remembered it i would n't have divorced you . 
no -- mama does n't dream about you any more walter . you would n't know the old girl now . 
let 's see . i was in reno six weeks -- then bermuda ... oh about four months i guess . seems like yesterday to me . 
how long is what ? 
hello walter .   hi louie -- how 's the slotmachine king ? 
why i 'm surprised mr. burns . that 's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she 's no longer your wife . 
first we talk . how did earl williams get that gun ? 
four hundred and fifty dollars . is it a deal ? 
a lot of money .   four hundred and fifty dollars -- 
there 's money in it cooley . 
cooley i want to talk to you . 
i thought so . come on i 'm in a hurry . 
say is n't this your twenty dollars ? 
i want to interview earl williams warden . how about a little service ? 
aw why do n't you let her alone ? she 's ill ! 
a fine bunch of reporters . biggest story in two years and they 're too lazy to go after it . 
give me a hand with her will you ? 
came up here -- had hysterics and passed out . i 've been trying to get her to come to . 
run down and get some smelling salts will you ? 
mollie drop down here ! you 've fainted ! 
all right -- all right ! 
just a second mike ---   mollie i got it ! 
three bullets ! any good ? 
i know i just want to give him a thrill . 
good . now i want to ask you fellows a couple of questions . did earl williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun ? 
gus this -- 
oh i 'm sorry gus ! my foot must have slipped . 
no -- just coffee gus . 
i guess so . 
oh -- i 'll take the same i guess . and coffee . 
how 's everything gus ? 
that 's murder ! 
he ca n't hurt anybody . you 've got his gun . 
he 's harmless . 
with a bag of marshmallows . 
he went over to the hospital to call on professor egelhoffer . 
i 've got a right to carry a gun if i want to . 
what do i know about williams ? 
nobody 's trying to put anything over on you . i 'm getting out of here and you ca n't stop me ! 
you can send somebody with me if you do n't believe me ! 
i do n't know anything i tell you . there 's been an accident . 
let me go !   fellows something 's happened to my mother - in - law . 
take your paws off me ! 
let go o ' me . what 's the idea ? 
that 's awful kind of you sheriff . i 've got to get started on my interview . see you later . 
no thanks sheriff . i 'm leaving town tonight . 
oh nothing much . just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself . if you do n't want me to run it -- 
all right then i 'll just run the story that sheriff hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner . of course with election coming that might do you a lot of harm but just as you say . 
same way you did .   through that gate . 
you 'll take fifty and like it ! 
you can let him out on bail ca n't you ? 
all right . you ca n't . but tomorrow the post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd street that your brother - in - law runs . and we 'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it ! 
do n't hildy me ! are you going to let him out ? 
and who accused him ? diamond louis ! one of the worst crooks in town ! why do n't you arrest louis instead of innocent people that he frames ? 
let him out of here lieutenant . 
nobody 's going to rush me into anything !   you keep away from me ! 
-- you were with her . you were in the cab were n't you ? 
what did you do with her ? 
oh - h - h ... was she hurt ? 
where 's the old lady ? 
wait a minute walter . you ca n't do that ! 
there goes another scrub lady . 
give me that ! 
who is it ? 
gentlemen of the press ! always picking on somebody who ca n't defend himself -- the littler the better . 
any news ? 
i 'll take it .   what 's the matter mr. burns -- do n't you understand english ? -- why your language is shocking mr. burns -- positively shocking ! i do n't mind because i was married to you and know what to expect but suppose central is listening in ... oh did you hear that central ? we ought to report him do n't you think ? ... oh fooey on you ! 
it 's getting so a girl ca n't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies .   hello post ... mr. walter burns please . 
well anyhow i wo n't be covering stuff like this any more . 
look out you -- 
what 's the matter with you boys ? afraid it might rain ? if you want to go i 'll cover this end . 
if walter burns calls hold the wire for me will you ? i 'll be right back . 
no -- what ? 
i thought so too . 
i made it up just now and who 's asking you ?   i know it 's silly honey but do it for me wo n't you ? ... yes right now . 
but bruce do n't keep it in your wallet ! ... well you see --   -- there 's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat . that brings you good luck for ten years . 
nothing doing . i 'm playing for keeps . 
i do n't know why you boys are so good to me . 
and up a dime . 
no -- and you do n't know that your cheap boss has had mr. baldwin arrested again -- do you ? 
you know it is ! 
none of that innocent stuff you double - crossing hyena ! you stuck bruce baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch and you frisked his wallet ! now give me that wallet or i 'll stick you in jail and it wo n't be on any phony charge either ! it 'll be for life ! 
so long nothing ! where 's bruce baldwin 's wallet ? 
where 's the money ? 
come on with that money ! 
four hundred and fifty and i 'll cut your throat if you try any tricks ! 
have you got my dough ? 
well -- i was going but mollie fainted away and i thought i ought to do what i could . 
from all i can get the sheriff let him out so 's he could vote for him . 
' kings and sixes the pot affixes ' ... poetry . i learned that at my grandma 's knee . 
kings and sixes . 
mother ! oh i 'm so glad to see you ! are you all right ? tell me . 
i do n't know what she 's talking about . i never said any such thing . 
mother i can explain everything . i 'll go with you in five minutes and -- 
we 'll get you out in ten minutes . 
stop screaming mollie or we 're sunk . i 'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back . 
how 'd you get here earl ? 
quiet mollie quiet ! 
sure i do earl . 
do n't talk too loud . 
well maybe you think i could ! 
earl you must never do that again . 
i do n't blame you earl .   if i were in your place i would n't trust anybody either . 
earl there 's just one thing i ought to clear up for the interview . 
sure you could earl -- but you would n't want to do that would you ? you would n't want to kill anybody . 
earl you do n't want to hurt your friends do you ? 
put down that gun earl . 
i wo n't earl . 
is n't that her picture ? 
no earl not at all .   who sent you the flowers earl ? 
very simple earl . 
is that how you came to shoot the policeman ? 
yes that makes a lot of sense earl . 
how would you go about applying the golden rule earl ? 
what are your beliefs earl ? 
you did n't mean to kill that policeman ? 
are you all right now ? 
shut up you ! 
never mind ! just play dead . 
i 'm coming !   keep dead quiet . do n't even breathe .

mollie they have n't got him . you got ta help me mollie ! we 've got to do something ! 
wait a minute mollie . 
they 're newspaper men mollie . they ca n't help themselves . the lord made them that way . 
come on mollie . this is no place for you . 
thank you billy from the baby and me . 
you did that for me and on the last day of your holidays ? 
that 's not the point . 
well i 'm not having any . even if it 's not poisoned . i do n't think it 's right . it 's not patriotic . 
i 'm starting my own collection . 
they 've got the real thing outside . 
please god . not on us . drop it on mrs. evans . she 's a cow . 
the next one is ours . either it hits us or it goes past us . 
you 're the biggest fibber . 
he 's the worst liar . 
you expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring ? and you 'll meet some french girl who can speak your own language . no thank you ! 
you do you do . you 're just not saying . 
what is it ? 
air - raid ? 
do n't be so cheeky bruce . 
they might be . 
a bit too quick . 
why ? it 's coming on its own . it does n't hurt . 
it looks a bit fishy to me . 
it 's not . it 's happening to me . 
now he 's gone and made me fall in love with him which i never wanted to do . i told him that . 
he said i was right . i should n't wait for him . i was better to make a clean break . 
he 's being posted . i was terrible to him . 
who said anything about love ? 
i want him . i want him so much . i 'll kill myself if i ca n't have him . 
no i wo n't . 
it 's only a joke mummy . i 'm fifteen . i 'm still at school . i want to be a nun when i grow up . 
that 's why you never liked me . i 'm different from you . well everything 's different now so it does n't matter . so there . 
tell me the truth . you had to get married did n't you ? because of me . 
well why do you always bring the carving knife in here ? 
what would we do if a german came into the house ? 
he always knows . 
after this dance . 
you know it ? it must be an old one . 
this phoney war get 's on my nerves . if we 're going to have a war i wish they 'd get it started . 
i 've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath clive . i never want to leave the river again . the children have had such a wonderful summer . 
i 've had a letter from her . they 've moved house . 
when do you think you 'll get leave again ? 
what are you going to be then ? 
why did n't they say that before you started ? 
you mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission ? 
you taste it . 
it looks .... foreign . 
how do we know they did n't plant it there ? they know we 're mad on jam .   they could poison half the country . 
we do n't know anything about it 
and what 's that ? 
i wish you could have told me yourself .   oh grace it 's not for long . they say it 'll be over by christmas . 
you joined up . 
has sue got it right ? 
and it was the last . has n't written a letter since . not even a birthday card . 
they 'd gone . 
no turks . 
now take deep breaths and push . 
could we salt them or smoke them do you think ? 
i do n't believe this is happening to me . 
i think it 's very sensible in the circumstances . 
what did he say ? 
do n't leave it like that . go after him . swallow your pride . 
what is it pet ? 
you better bring him home if you really love him . do n't kill love . you 'll regret it for the rest of your life . 
there there my baby .

i doubt if a few bombs would wake up dawn on a sunday morning . 
was n't it lovely ? 
up to six weeks i think . 
no mother ! it 's war ! war ! 
i wish it could all have been different . 
bless you mac . what would i have done without you ? 
we did all the proper things and we lost love . that 's sad mac . 
this war 's put an end to decent things . i want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once hold nothing back . 
he could always make me laugh . 
you were never apart you and clive . he kept asking and asking .   and i waited and waited for you to say something . and you never did . 
not loving enough . that is a terrible thing to do to someone . i suppose i did it to clive . always held something back . 
mac did you ever find out who molly went off with ? 
remember this beach mac ? all those summers . out two families together . 
that 's right . not since then not since i got married . 
mac that was wonderful . i have n't been to a concert since ...

i ca n't do it . what 's the point ?

marrying a midget was a cheap thrill ? 
one night stand ? 
he 's so cute . i even like his cute little penis . it 's like a little pig 's penis or something .   rose we connect on every level . i 've finally found someone i can feel completely safe with . 
i can not believe how in love i am with this man . 
i really like him rose . he 's so ...   ... passionate about his work . 
god he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff .

honey can we talk tonight ? you know about stuff ? things have been so strained for the past three weeks since you know and i just want to talk .

i wo n't allow you . it 's wrong . he 's happy here . 
oh no . you ca n't take him from his home nathan . 
nathan what the hell are you talking about ? 
look at him . he does n't understand english . he moves like an animal . 
i do n't understand you . this is fascinating and you just want to run away . i mean here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization totally free and all you want to do is run back to your ... 
he looks perfectly fine . 
i think he 's feral . 
come on . 
no . too ... upright . might 've been a person . 
i do n't know . something . 
did you see that ? 
that 's very funny . 
yes darling . 
of course . 
yes darling . 
i do n't think so .   why ? 
it 'll be wonderful ! i 'll show you my old stomping grounds ! 
oh darling . i 'm so relieved . let 's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow ! 
do you ? oh do you darling ? 
do you ? 
you did n't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother 's stupid tasteless cruel animal jokes .

oh i 'm sorry .   i 'm sorry nathan . i never really learned those things . 
i 'm sorry ? 
um - mmm . oh nathan this salad is delish ... 
it looks wonderful . 
we are animals after all . 
i 'm not sure . 
going out on a limb are n't you nathan ? 
what 's the larger experiment ? 
paper or cloth ? 
how 's it going ? 
i hope you do n't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments nathan . 
you are a therapist right ? 
i 'm not sure we can escape our natures . believe me i 've tried . i 'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to . 
that 's not necessarily a bad thing . 
you 've got to respect that . 
thank you so much . i love slugs . all slugs not just banana slugs . 
hush . no it is never terrible to be in love . nathan 's memory lives on in our sacred union .   i 'm not sorry she killed him either . nathan was wonderful . he was erudite and sophisticated and charming . you are all that too . but you have something more . you have a bit of the animal in you . 
you remind me so much of nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie . 
you remind me so much of nathan . 
say my name . 
oui . nathan 's silk suit just like you asked . 
hello my little boy . 
please let me go with you . 
okay my sweet . good night .

so we 've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements my wonderful men . 
you were wonderful ! 
you hurt me you know when you made nathan 's choice . does that not even matter to you you pig ? 
that 's not how he tells it . 
i 've been seeing johannsen in chemistry . 
i 've moved on . 
anyway . come already to the point . 
please . i look a mess . 
you heard me ! you make me sick when you pretend to not understand what i am saying to you ! go away from here ! 
you think too much . i need a man who does n't think so much but acts more than he thinks ... is what i need ! 
what for ? 
like what ? 
why ? you 've made your decision mister stinky american ! now i hate you ! no i do n't hate you ; i do n't even think about you ! 
we have nothing to say ! you are a rotten bastard that 's what ! 
call you back .   you bastard ! what do you want ? 
yeah ? what ? 
take me darling ! tame your little monkey of love ! 
the way you are taming him it sends chills down my girlish spine and ... everywhere else too . 
you were wonderful today darling . such authority with the ape - man boy . it made me so hot for you . 
sure sure just the money and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart . you 're a roman bert . you have to win them all . 
and the way you 're looking at me is that the way you look at a man you 've just beaten ? as if you 'd just taken his money and now all you want is ... his pride ? 
put it on the bed . that 's the way it 's done is n't it ? 
in a little while . that 's what you want is n't it ? 
thank you . 
you bastard . 
no there 's no tomorrow . not with you . you own all the tomorrows because you buy them today and you buy cheap . 
you did n't answer my first question . for whom ? 
for whom and for what ? 
you know what 's good for him ? 
do we need words ? 
we 're neighbors now . you can call me sarah . 
and a fact is a fact . 
it 's all right eddie . i 'm sure mr. gordon meant no offense . it was a figure of speech . 
does n't your lighter work mr. gordon ? 
what makes you know so much ? how do you know what eddie was thinking ? 
i 'm ready . 
i 've never been to louisville . 
no i 'm fine . 
packard . sarah packard . 
do n't wear a mask eddie . you do n't have to .   that 's turk eddie the man who broke your thumbs . only he 's not going to break your thumbs . he 'll break your heart your guts . and for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you 'cause of what you are . 'cause of what you have and he has n't . 
does n't all of this come through to you eddie ? does n't any of this mean anything to you ? that man this place the people . they wear masks eddie . and underneath the masks they 're perverted twisted crippled . 
please eddie do n't beg him . 
i 'm a little tired . 
if you do n't mind i think i 'll stay at the hotel . 
he went off someplace . 
fifty - seven . 
no .   i made you up did n't i eddie ? you were n't real . i made you up like everything else . there was no car crash eddie . when i was five i had polio . i was never an actress . the rich old man is my father . he walked out on us when i was seven . he sends me a check every month . that 's how he buys his way out of my life . the men i 've known ... after they left i 'd say they were n't real i made them up . but you eddie . i wanted you to be real . 
i 'd know it eddie . i 'd know . for god 's sakes what are you trying to do to me ? i love you . 
what do you want me to do ? just sit here and wait ? faithful little sarah . pull the shades down and sit . when you feel like coming back you 'll come back . and you 'll love me . and then you 'll go away again . is that your idea of love ? 
if you were going to come back you would n't have taken me out tonight . you would n't have bought this dress . you 're hustling me eddie . you 've never stopped hustling me . 
why should i ? 
leave now . 
no .   yes i want to know what for . but i do n't want to ask . 
no i want to walk .

i feel pretty . 
sherry .   very old very dry . 
yes i 'm glad . 
yes i need them very much . and if you ever say them i 'll never let you take them back . 
i love you . 
you 're not a loser eddie . you 're a winner . some men never get to feel that way about anything . i love you eddie . 
does it bother you ? what he said ? 
is that what makes a winner ? 
is he a winner ? 
what does he do this bert gordon ? 
why did he tell you ?

eddie what 's in that case ? 
oh it 's not bad . 
oh cut my finger .

i 'm getting treatments right here . 
when i 'm sober . they get a little mixed up when i 'm drunk . most of the time they 're mixed up . 
mm hmm . 
you want to go with me ? 
eddie where do you go when you go out ? 
you were asleep when i left . i did n't want to wake you . did you go out ? 
at school . it 's thursday . 
i 'm not sure ... i do n't know . 
sarah .   eddie look . i 've got troubles and i think maybe you 've got troubles . maybe it 'd be better if we just leave each other alone . 
i lied . when i 'm drunk i lie . 
how did you know my name was sarah ? 
oh you need a shave . you must n't go looking like that . there 's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom . compliments of the house . 
what time is it ? 
a day like any other . people come people go . 
why did you do that ? 
what do you want me to do just step out in the alley ? is that it ? 
i like it to be what it is . it 's sarah . that 's a biblical name . you want to know its meaning ? 
the name should be eddie . what should my name be ? 
no . no more . i 'm getting sleepy .   thank you very much mr ... ?

i used to be an actress . 
sometimes i wake up and i ca n't sleep not without a drink . the bars do n't open until eight . mack over there has faith in me . when i 'm broke he trusts me . do n't you trust me mack ? 
do you always ask so many questions ? 
i know where you live : in a locker in a bus station . what 's it like living in a locker ? 
same reason you went : at that hour of the morning you have n't much choice . besides i only live three blocks from there . where do you live ? 
i was n't waiting for a bus . 
it 's the lights . and the scotch . 
two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast . 
why not ? we already know each other 's secrets . 
thanks . i will . 
that would n't give us much time would it ? 
eight o'clock . 
what bus ? 
fine thanks . 
since four . 
you have to go .   he 'll never stop . leave this place .   find another . 
i want to talk .   i just learned again . 
he wanted me to see -- he thinks i was -- infected by you . 
do you still want me to stay ? 
you want me to stay ? 
before ... when i was one of them . i would look at this and it was just strangers .   now i ... remember . 
i do n't know . 
i do n't know . 
i know it .   what do you want robert ? 
will you keep feeding me ?   how long can you live like that ?   until it kills you ?   until i kill you ? without your blood i 'll go back . 
you know what i mean . 
what do you want ? 
you are the human .   the hunter .   the thing that comes in the day and kills -- 
you hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered ? ! 
why do n't you start with me ? 
you want to kill them . 
you want to find them . 
who is this ? 
dark and large .   with vines -- no not vines .   not alive . 
we move .   place to place . 
with them ? 
it was warm .   i was outside .   the ocean ? 
it comes back .   flashes .   my name . 
it is not arguing to speak the truth . 
that is not now human ! 
i ca n't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners -- 
you -- think i am -- i 'm --   -- an animal . 
why yes .   why ? 
he was upset with moving i believe . 
i 'm sorry mr. gardner .   i was out of my office for a minute and when i got back -- he was gone . 
yes mr. gardner . 
of course . 
mr. gardner i do n't think this is the place to discuss this matter . 
mr. gardner i -- 
children often have trouble adjusting to a new school . 
we were having a little talk . 
yes i do mr. gardner . 
hello this is ms. magnuson speaking . 
you 're looking for life ? 
let 's try . 
we ca n't do this alone .   we 've got to get help . 
do n't go in . 
yes ... yes but i 'm not sure what i saw anymore . 
i do n't know .   i do n't know what i 'm doing here -- 
no one comes here after dark . 
all their lines were busy . 
the state police . 
stay here .   i 'm going to make a phone call . 
does it look to you like anything landed here ? 
we 'll be very careful .   but we have to see .   if something landed there there would be a big scar in the ground . would n't there ? 
let 's go look at the sand pit behind your house . 
but it 's not jimmy . 
i do n't see anything . 
if we go and look and there 's nothing there you 'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind . 
where jimmy ? 
jimmy calm down !   what happened ? tell me what happened ! 
this shows how to get to my home . i 'm giving you back roads and footpaths so there 's less chance of you being seen . 
do you know how to follow a map ? 
what would you think if somebody told you a story like this ? 
how did it get mrs. mckeltch ? 
a ufo lands in back of your house and puts something in your dad and mom 's necks .   then it gets the police and your teacher too . 
that 's quite a story .   you know that do n't you ? 
can you tell me about that ? 
why not ?   moving is hard for anybody .   was it hard for you to leave all your friends ? 
this is a new town for you .   do you like it here ? 
all right .   i 'll be right back . 
why yes . 
what 's his family background ? 
his teacher brought him in to see me . said he 'd been acting up in class . creating a disturbance .   i could n't get a thing out of him . 
what 's the story on jimmy gardner ? 
you bet it did . 
are you all right ? 
with you ? i do n't understand why you ca n't just show someone how to plant the virus somebody trained for this kind of mission ? 
thirty seconds ? is n't that cutting it a little too close ? 
i wanted a career . did n't you ever want to be part of something special ? 
he 's a good man . 
i take it you 've heard . 
david do n't ... 
i ca n't leave . we have to tell this to the president . 
what do you want me to do ? 
and when is the countdown supposed to expire ? 
david ? how 'd you get this number ? 
you 're being paranoid . 
in case you have n't noticed we 're in a little bit of a crisis here . 
this is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion . 
what do you want ? 
love was never our problem . 
spunky . he told you about that ? 
he still gets air sick huh ? in all of this i did n't get the chance to thank you two . 
my ex - husband works in satellite communications . 
david thought i was having an affair which i was n't . 
we 're losing them . 
you saved a lot of lives . 
i 'll bet . 
i do n't know how you put up with him . 
more than likely . 
dick - weed . 
you scared the hell out of me . 
sorry for what ? 
i know you like to make a big entrance . 
you 're late . 
you 're late . 
dick - weed ! 
you know you 're not as charming as you think you are . 
really ? you do n't mind ? 
be careful . 
wait . i have to tell you something . 
you said you were on leave for the fourth . 
you ca n't go . call them back . 
he 's trying to impress you . 
did n't want to say anything . i voted for the other guy . 
dylan come here . i want you to meet the first lady . 
funny it used to scare me when i thought about the future .   guess it does n't really matter anymore . 
do n't be . i 'm not . it 's good money .   ' side he 's worth it . 
no . exotic . 
i 'm a dancer . 
he was n't his father . i was kinda hoping he 'd want the job though . 
he 's my angel . 
i can reach it . i can reach it ... 
it 's ours indy . yours and mine . 
i never expected to see you again . 
all i have to do is scream . 
you do . 
is that what you think of me ? i believe in the grail not the swastika . 
you came back for the book ? why ? 
how did you get here ? 
this book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret canyon of the crescent moon . 
how do you know ? 
what are you going to do ? 
i know the brunwalds are famous art collectors . 
it 's lucky i do n't do things the same way . you 'd still be standing at the venice pier . 
oh yes . give them a flower and they 'll follow you anywhere . 
you had it ? you did n't trust me ! 
the grail diary . 
what were they looking for ? 
my room ! 
you said go between them ! 
would n't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this ? 
what 's that ? 
look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork . 
are you sure ? 
the christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later . 
pagan symbols . fourth or fifth century . 
lower me down . 
you do n't disappoint doctor jones . you 're a great deal like your father . 
find something ? 
but i 'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded . 
in that case i permit you . 
i usually do n't . 
the last time i saw your father we were in the library . he was very close to tracking down the knight 's tomb . i 've never seen him so excited . he was as giddy as a schoolboy . 
looks like the best parts have already been spoken for . 
i knew it was you -- 
doctor jones ? 
it 's some kind of cult ! and they 've got the sacred stones that indy was searching for . 
we found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace ! please come with me i 'll show you ! 
no -- you ca n't go ! something awful 's happened . they 've got short round and i think indy 's been -- 
what 're you talking about -- i 'm not a dope fiend ! i saw it ! i 'll show you ! 
i 'm afraid they 'll kill them ! we saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man 's heart out ! 
no ? well i guess he just has n't met the right woman ... 
listen mr. lal what do you call the maharajah 's wife ? 
dinner ? and with a prince ? ! my luck is changing . but look at me -- my god i 've to get ready ! 
oh -- good . and maybe the present maharajah is a little younger ? and thinner ? 
you should have been there ... 
hard to believe is n't it ... ? 
you did n't do so well yourself . finding that stone could 've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about . 
and they do n't even know what it really is . 
i guess mola ram got what he wanted . 
anymore ideas ... ? 
what above the curves ? ! 
i ca n't ! 
what 're we going to do ? ! 
you know you 've been nothing but trouble since i hooked up with you -- but i have to admit i 'd miss you if i lost you ... 
i was scared to death last night when i thought they were going to kill you . 
so now they believe me . 
indy ? did you talk to them ? 
i want to go home ... 
they think i 'm insane . tell them i 'm not indy . please -- help me ... 
you 're gon na get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory ! 
down ? down there ? ! are you crazy ! 
wait -- what 're you doing ? 
let 's go ! let 's get out of here ! 
oh my god ! he ripped out his -- he killed him ! 
what is it ... ? 
oh god it 's soft -- it 's moving ! 
i am -- it looks horrible ! 
there 's a hole ! i found a square hole ! 
i ca n't find any lever ! help me indy ! 
a what ? ! 
there 's bugs ! bugs all over ! help ! help me ! 
i 'm coming what 's the rush ? ! ohh ! what 's that ? ! there 's stuff all over the floor ! i ca n't see a thing !

no -- do n't you see -- crawling -- 
five minutes ... you 'll be back over here in five minutes ... 
dr. jones ? 
we 'll see who gives in first -- i 'll leave my door open . 
too proud to admit you 're crazy about me dr. jones ? 
you 're dying to come into my room are n't you ? 
primitive sexual practices ? 
yeah -- and nothing else .   that shock you ? 
you 're nice . listen i 'm taking applications -- how 'd you like to be my palace slave ? 
not leftovers ? 
i 've never been so hungry in my life ... 
that 's the maharajah -- that kid ? ! 
she might get away with that act here but she 'd never make it in a real nightclub . 
yeah i wish you 'd thought of this sooner ... 
you mean we have to walk the rest of the way ? 
he 's afraid of something . 
just try and control yourself . 
i 'd be safer sleeping with that snake . 
you mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village ? 
that 's shiva ? what 's he giving the priest ? 
what does the writing say ? 
is that what you 're hoping to find at this palace dr. jones ? 
oh really ? 
oh that 's easy -- i 'm going to latch onto a good - looking incredibly rich prince . 
he 'll be okay . he 's a good kid . 
where 'd you find your little bodyguard ? 
thanks for nothing ! i hate snakes ! 
it 's starting to let go ! 
oh -- my -- god -- it 's going to crush me ! 
the what ? ! 
pet it ? ? ! ! 
just one arm ! 
what ? ! 
it 's curling around me ! damn it stop talking and do something ! 
it 's pulling me deeper ! 
what ? ! 
hurry help me out of here ! what 're you waiting for ? ! 
a snake ! ! 
a snake ! 
indy ! help me ! 
somehow i feel safer in here . 
stark naked ? you wish ... if you 're trying to seduce me dr. jones this is a very primitive approach . 
what 'd he say now ? 
their children ? 
took what ? 
god i am starving but i ca n't eat this ... 
dream -- nightmare is more like it . 
what do you mean -- how ? 
what 'd he say ? 
holy cow -- india ? how do you know we 're in -- 
no ... i 'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead .   oh no ... i ripped my dress . where are we anyway ? 
are you crazy a lift raft ? ! we 're not sinking we 're crashing ! 
i 'm freezing . what do you mean tag along ? from the minute you walked into that nightclub you have n't been able to keep your eyes off me . 
so what 're you supposed to be a lion tamer ? 
siam ? but i 'm not dressed for siam ... 
i 'll take the extra ticket .   where 's this plane going anyway ? 
what 're we going to do ? ! where 're we going ? ! 
you do n't look very good . 
listen we just met for crissake ! i 'm not that kind of girl ! 
for crying out loud a kid 's driving the car ? !

it was a good job . not many ways for a foreigner to make money here . ryuji hires me to organize business meetings ... take care of things . 
friend of gruner . just went along for the party . 
ryuji and gruner . 
they 'd never talk in front of me . they 'd walk away up the beach . nervous about something . 
lots of my clients are rich guys ... they like danger .. like playing with drugs and things ... running around acting mysterious . 
oh sure . 
i do n't know . he mentioned a city . 
how do you know you can trust me ?

you talk to yourself . 
that you 're not crazy . 
are you alright ? 
can i help ? 
as if your mind 's not all there . 
... and sort of ... disinterest . 
i guess it 's a combination you do n't often see . apparent attraction ..

i waited for you . 
you again . 
i just work for the travel firm . 
you mean from it .

that 's for food . 
use the bathroom . 
please do n't wash your hands in the sink . 
an interview ! do you know what they will do to us ... ! i thought ... sorry . 
... taping ?   what are you taping ? 
no thank you . 
what are we supposed to do ... ? what about our medical coverage ; what about our health ? what about our car payments ? the payments on this house ? 
why ? who said ? 
i do n't understand . 
why did you take your stuff from the office ? 
right now ? 
what do you need at the store ? 
uh what are those boxes ? 
i 'm sorry darling have you seen my coffee mug ... ? 
yes it 's on the stove ... 
do n't you have to be at the office ? 
you 're not listening .   really know what you 're going to do before you do it . 
no you do not . 
get some perspective lowell . 
so it 's a big country with a free press . you can go work somewhere else . 
jeffrey wigand ... 
oh baby ... 
what are you and mike going to do ? 
what ? ! 
what 's wrong ? 
i have to take a shower . 
... no ... this looks like a table of temperatures ... who 's this from ? 
two p.m. great . bye - bye . 
i ca n't ... i 've got to fly to boston tomorrow . 
hello ? yeah ... 
no classes this morning ? 
it 's stuart ... he 's in mexico city ... 
we 'd better go before we get thrown out . 
they say the massey pre - nup has never been penetrated . 
therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet howard -- i wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement . 
as you are well aware my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation my motives were questioned . i was slandered in court . 
-- we realized we 'd always been very attracted to one another . 
honey i do n't think this is really relevant to ... 
sixteen years ? howard jr. is fourteen and mandy must be what -- twelve ? 
miles i know you 're busy and that you charge by the hour so i 'll come to the point . howard and i are planning to marry . 
miles how nice of you to see us -- may i introduce howard d. doyle of doyle oil . 
i think ming is older than tong .   what is this ? 
i said yes . 
it 's about time . 
in the godfather after the courtroom scene frankie pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub . 
maybe she wanted a free trip to la . maybe they offered her money . massey is very seductive . who knows . 
it was like that scene in the godfather . frankie pentangeli is called to testify against the family . and he 's in court and he looks into the spectators gallery and sees his brother . they brought the brother from sicily . and frankie ca n't say a word . he ca n't testify . that 's what it was like seeing pat in there . i could n't even have ruth cross examine her . 
i ca n't have a baby with a man i do n't love ... and i ca n't submit a child to divorce . 
ruth rabino . 
i do n't see how we can ever find our way back from ... 
forgery ? fraud ? 
your forgetting rex rexroth ? 
yes . i know . it 's exactly how i felt when i realized you 'd hired the goon to kill ... 
it 's not something i wanted either . 
hello miles . 
i 'm not leaving you . i took self defense 
that 's true . 
wait just a second there . you sent him here . you unearthed this pestilence . 
now . but first he worked for you . 
it 's okay joe . 
it 's a no go joe . 
you do ? you do love me ? 
i fell in love miles . 
just listen to me . i 'm sorry miles . it 's true that my initial intention was to ... 
i will miles . i will leave . but miles -- 
miles ? miles ! where have you been ? i 've been trying to get in touch . 
that 's marriage . 
drop the bogus forgery charge and i 'll forget about your generous friends slash clients . 
i believe the residence will be part of the settlement . 
i know . so am i right ? and so is agent wilson of the internal revenue service . he 's a dedicated underpaid graduate of southwestern university -- very tenacious and never more so than when he 's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague .   i think it 's only fair to warn you : i 'm going to file an action miles . and after a decent interval i plan to have ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house . 
i do n't have to . that 's what the irs guys do . and they do it with great zeal . see they work at these tortuous civil service jobs and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies these saps feel .. well they feel like saps . and they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel wrath .   what is this ? a romeo and julieta ? 
salary . unreported income .   by the way what time is it on bellagio road ? 
arty farty stuff .   lithographs and pre castro cubans . watches and mileage on private jets . stuff miles . stuff you get from grateful clients . 
stuff .   got a light ? 
i 'm not talking about dollars studmuffin . i 'm talking about -- 
i 'm reporting you to the irs . 
i want to nail you ass . 
on the contrary . we 're married and we have no pre - nup so a case could be made that everything in here is mine . 
i 'd just like to pick up a few of my things 
may i come in ? 
miles ? you 're scaring me . 
miles . i have a very good relationship with all the salesmen . i can return everything . 
what 's wrong miles ? did i spend too much ? 
you do n't like me ? 
i have a surprise for you . 
fabric and fringe . 
hardly . you have six bedrooms 
honey i could sit ... 
i 'm sorry . i 'm squishing you . i 'll move to the ... 
i want this to be a marriage based on love trust and community property . that 's all i 've ever wanted . 
oh miles ! 
was n't she the judge at my divorce hearing ? 
i know . 
yes . again . 
do you want to sleep on it ? 
do you want me to sleep on it ? 
yes miles . i accept . 
did you just propose to me ? 
what is it miles ? 
i 'm a little embarrassed . i 'm not used to losing control with such -- volume . 
thank you for the coffee . it 's very robust . 
i 'm sorry miles . you should n't listen to me . i 'm sure you have a very fulfilling life . i 'd better go . i 'm depressing . 
we 're damaged goods . 
oh right . you met patricia . 
and here i thought my mother was ... 
boy . boy oh boy . 
she held that against you ? 
she did n't love you ? 
and your mother was very beautiful . she must be proud of you . 
you look like you were a very sensitive child . you have expressive eyes . 
oh . and that is -- mom ? 
is that you ? 
no kidding . i 'll bet you have some very grateful clients . what 'd rex buy you ? 
from a -- girlfriend . 
you have wonderful art . i love that lithograph . hockney ? 
you have a very nice home miles . very inviting . 
okay miles . 
okay . should i stop at starbucks and pick up a blended for -- 
i 'm on sunset . near the beverly hills hotel . wanna meet me for a drink in the polo ... ? 
a little .   you get out of the car . that 's right fuctard . i 'm talkin ' to you ! 
screw you asswipe ! 
i do n't blame them for betraying me . i do n't blame rex or howard or my father . you see miles i 'm going to tell you something about me . something you may or may not know . i suck ! 
you 're right about me . i am worthless . i am nothing . i do n't deserve to live . 
you really think i engineered the whole thing . you think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme . you came here to celebrate because you think i 'm without morality or soul . you --   sound like my mother . 
did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs . 
i do n't feel victorious miles . i feel betrayed abandoned and humiliated . i have pictures of him with another woman ... 
it has bones . be sure to swallow one . 
have you tried the duck ? 
it was his idea . it was a gesture of love and trust . be happy for me miles . 
miles . miles . miles . 
howard is a beautiful person . 
so i hear . is that all ? 
we told you . we realized we 've always been in love . 
no . you listen to me .   you busted me miles . you left me with nothing ! what did you expect me to do ? get a degree in counseling ? write a book about table linen ? because that 's what wives do when they get dumped and frankly i 'm not quite ready for that . 
all girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time . 
he 's passionate . 
getting married . 
that is true is n't it miles ? your pre - nup is the best there is ? 
he 'll regret this . 
yes . why is that so difficult for you to understand ? 
yes . i loved my husband rex . 
well do n't look at mine ! 
what is it you 're after miles ? 
see the tape . then we can discuss reconciliation . rex screwed up and i nailed his ass . now i 'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it . then i 'm getting on with my life . that 's all i 'm after . 
all right miles . let me tell you everything you think you know . i was married to rex for a long time . i was an excellent wife a partner a lover a hostess and a friend . there was only one thing i did wrong during the five years we were together . i got five years older . think he should be able to ditch me for that ? 
you just have n't met the right person . 
you do n't believe in it . 
have you ever been married miles ? 
you did n't ask me here to pick me up . you could get in trouble for that . 
i know you do . 
i told you . i was hungry . 
how do you know ? 
ruth says you 've been too successful that you 're bored complacent and you 're on your way down . 
tell me mr. massey . what was your performance about this afternoon ? 
see the tape . then we can discuss my heart . 
did you see the tape ? 
i assume this is on rex ? 
these are yours . 
positano is beautiful . remember when we were there rex ? we stayed in the santo pietro ? that hotel on the cliff ? 
and you must be mr. massey . 
have you been taking your digestive enzymes ? 
do you need a tagamet ? 
are you alright ? you lost weight . 
hello rex . 
rex . go away . i do n't want to have to sic the dogs on you . 
are you forgetting about the atcheson topeka and the santa fe ? 
we are . and it 's winding down . 
rex . get away from the door . 
so . now what ? 
he never even asked . he just assumed -- 
do you think he set me up ? do you think that was his intention ? 
he told me to -- he said he wanted me to -- 
forgery and fraud ? 
i was devastated . of course . 
i 'm sorry . where were we ? 
i guess . 
he has no cynicism or anger . for once i 'm not the repository of rage at some other woman . 
miles is different . he 's still so idealistic . 
yes yes it 's just -- you know i 've never been the first wife . rex was married before me . 
he 's not what i expected . he 's very -- he 's so -- happy . 
i ca n't do this anymore . let 's get some lunch . 
is this ming ? 
i want to be exposed . 
sarah sorkin . ramona barcelona -- this is miles massey . 
no . i 'll see some blood before this is over but it wo n't be mine . 
probably . every woman in my life was divorced at least twice . what was i supposed to say . anthropologist ? 
nothing specific but i 'll have my own place soon . 
they bought her speech . if i was only in it for rex 's money he should n't have to give me any . 
get this ! he called and invited me to dinner . 
well if he continues to maintain this position -- we 're in court . 
anyway even rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence . if i did n't know better i 'd swear massey had some personal investment in my ruination . 
every week -- 
lilly 's up . 
i do n't know . ruth kept her cool but i could tell she was surprised . 
i do n't know what his game is . he dismissed every one of ruth 's proposals . and sarah we were n't unreasonable . 
please . i 'm not seeing anyone until this is over . one husband at a time . 
who 's she ? 
do you know him ? 
miles massey . 
in the words of my private investigator we 're going to nail his ass . 
she did a harriman . 
i did n't know barry had a beach house . 
soon you 'll have your own rage ! 
well that 's about to change big time . 
so what ? 
but you 're going through with it ? 
what about rugs ? i thought we were stopping at mansour ? 
it 's not ming . it 's tong . 
but marylin without this you 're completely exposed . 
hello miles . 
you 're not ... 
so marylin . is that what you said when you were a little girl ? 
that stinks . they left you with absolutely nothing . it makes you wonder about the entire legal system . like rodney king . 
so where are you now ? 
i 'm dying . 
oh god ! 
he has a reputation for being tough . 
well what does he want ? 
i wish i had your discipline . 
we do have a man for you . 
now ? she 's a night manager at mcdonalds . 
by reputation . he got ann rumsey that cute little island of george 's . 
of massey myerson ? 
she 's a legend . did n't she do kravis or a pearlman ? she definitely did a factor . 
neither did i until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog 's name . 
you want to come out to the beach house tomorrow ? 
well you can live here as long as you want . do you have any plans ? 
she 's keeping his name . and one of his planes . and all seven of his children 
it 's not so bad these days . kids like joint custody . two sets of toys . 
muriel rumsey . 
who 's rex 's guy ? 
ramona ! do n't get mia farrow on us . 
i 'm worried lovington . after all something might have happened to her . 
it 's not enough !   are you certain she 's not with king westley ? 
what i 'm asking is n't impossible . my daughter is somewhere between here and miami . i want her found ! 
yes . i know . still in the dumps huh ? 
what 's the matter ? anything wrong ? 
how is she ? 
i asked you a question . do you love her ? 
do you love her ? 
that 's an evasion . 
here you are .   do you mind if i ask you something frankly ?   do you love my daughter ? 
you were taken for a buggy ride ? 
the average man would go after the reward . all you seem to 
you 're a peculiar chap . 
i 'm afraid i 'm a little confused . you see i assumed you were coming here for 
the reward . 
let me get this straight . you want this thirty - nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars ? 
yes i knowbut 
and this is what you wantthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents ? 
do n't know . i 'd have to see on what you base your claim . i presume you feel you 're justified in 
please understand me . when i say she did n't tell me anything about it i mean not until a little while ago . she thinks you 're entitled to anything you can get . 
i was surprised to get your note . my daughter had n't told me anything about you . about your helping her . 
come in . sit down . 
mr. warne ? 
you need n't see anybody . you can come directly to my study . i 'd appreciate it very much if 
ca n't you get them to go any faster ?   this dissolves to a deserted road peter at the wheel of his car . his high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing . 
i 'll be going .   ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another as king enters . 
i suppose so . 
i 'm sorry you read it . 
why no . . . do n't be silly . 
oh nono . 
peter warne ! 
is that his name ? 
but that 's silly child . seeing how you feel why 
well under the circumstances do n't you think we ought to call this thing off ? 
i 'd like to have a talk with him . 
well what are we going to do about it ? where is he ? 
fine man to fall in love with . 
oh come now 
well if it 's as serious as all thatwe'll move heaven and earth to 
who is he ? 
now do n't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver ! 
i have n't seen you cry since you were a baby . this must be serious .   where 'd you meet him ? 
if you have it is n't too late . you know how i feel about him . but i want to make you happy . you gave me such a scareiwhen i could n't find you .   you know the old pump is n't what it used to be . 
you 've been acting so strangely since you returned . i'mi'm worried . i have n't bothered to ask you any questionsi   is n't all this what you wanted ?   you have n't changed your mind about king have you ? 
what 's the matter ellie ? what 's wrong ? 
yes . personally i think it 's silly too . 
landing on the lawn in an autogyro . 
well everything 's set . creating quite a furor too . great stunt king 's going to pull . 
i knocked several times . 
ah ! coconut layer cake . nice and gooey too . just the way i like it . 
please do n't shout . 
a time will come when you 'll thank me for this . 
he 's no good ellie and you know it . you married him only because i told you not to . 
you 're going to finance him i suppose . 
never mindi'll get it myself .   gigolo ? why you took the word right out of my mouth . thanks . 
that was enough . do you mind handing me the ketchup ? 
nothing much . i just think he 's a fake that 's all . 
i 'll do it if it takes every penny i 've got . i 'll do it if i have to bribe that musical comedy justice of the peace ! i 'll do itif i have to prove that you were dragged in staggering drunk . you probably were .   mmmmmm . this filet mignon is divine ! 
i 'll get it annulled . 
in that event we wo n't need so many supplies . 
we leave miami in an hour . soon 's we get some supplies aboard . 
south america . 
please . i ca n't fight on an empty stomach . remember what napoleon said . 
if gandhi had a chef like paul it would change the whole political situation in india . 
not so far as i 'm concerned you 're not .   yes ? 
because marrying that fool king westley is 
you ought to know why . because 
come on ellie . stop being silly . you know i 'm going to have my way . 
i might . 
know what my next move is ? no more cigarettes . 
what 's this about not eating ? 
of course i mean it ! i do n't care whom she 's married to   as long as i can get her back . 
all right . that 's why i sent for you .   there 's a room full of reporters out there . i want you to make a statementthat you 've had a talk with methat we 've reached an understandingthat if ellen comes home i wo n't interfere with your marriage . will you do that ? 
yes . i know . well you can help now . i issued a statement yesterday that i 've withdrawn my objections . begging her to come home . i have n't heard from her . apparently she does n't trust me . 
terrible ! nothing terrible about her . she 's great ! marvelous youngster ! got a mind of her own . knows just what she wants .   she 's not going to get it though . she wo n't get very far . has no money . 
it 's my daughter ! go after her . 
absurd !   all this fuss over a snip of a girl .   i 'm going down to see her myself . 
why did n't you jam it down her throat ? 
been sending her meals in regularly ? 
on a hunger strike huh ?   when 'd she eat last ? 
i have n't the slightest idea . 
we 've done that already . 
personally i think it 's stupid !   but go ahead . have a good time . as long as ellie does n't object . 
you thought that up all by yourself huh ? 
fine . i 'll see you at the reception . 
try . do me a favor . try . it 's your only chance . and hers too . do that for meand maybe we 'll be friends   maybe .   do we understand each other ? 
sock her ! 
no ?   say listeni've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat . toughest job i ever tackled . ever hear of j.p. clarkson ? biggest man in the country is n't he ? well i tamed him . got him eating out of the palm of my hand . i 've browbeaten financiers statesmen foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut i 've never been able to do a thing with her . she 's been too much for me . i 'm glad you think it 's easy .   now listenif you 'll do what i tell you perhaps i might develop a little respect for you . you never can tell . 
someday perhaps you might even take charge . 
naturally .   you 're going to become a partner in a big institution . it 's one of the largest in the world . 
you 've got a good thing and you 're hanging on to it huh ?   all right you win . i 'll just have to get used to you . i admit i 'm licked . but only because i 'm worried . i 've had detectives all over the country searching for her . i 've seen thousands of photographs . fortune tellers nuts every crank in the country has written me .   have n't slept one night this week . if i do n't find her i 'll go crazy . 
i have n't changed my mind westley i want you to understand that ! i do n't like you ! i never have !   i never will ! that 's clear enough is n't it ? 
ooooooh .   hello my would - be ex - son - in - law . i 've sent you a check for a hundred thousand . yes . that 's the smartest thing you ever did westley not to contest that annulment . that 's satisfactory is n't it ? yeah . well it ought to be . oh i 'm not complaining . it was dirt cheap .   do n't fall out of any windows . 
do n't want to talk todon't want to talk to anybody . do n't want to see anybody . 
what do they say ? 
any others ? 
well if it is n't the groom himself ! you 're just in time king . 
certainly !   pay him off . he 's entitled to it . he did an excellent job . kept me thoroughly entertained . it 's worth every penny he gets . 
are you going to see him ? 
looks like that was his only interest in me . the reward . 
oh please dad 
you have n't heard from him have you dad ? 
why ? do you know him ? 
yes . peter warne . 
yes i guess i have .   i do n't want to hurt anybody any more . i want to get away from all this front page publicity . it suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome . i ca n't walk out on king now . it 'll make us all look so ridiculous .   besides what difference does it make ?   i 'll never see peter again . 
it does n't matter .   i do n't want to stir up any more trouble . i 've been doing it all my life . i 've been such a burden to youmade your life so miserableand mine too . i 'm tired dad . tired of running around in circles . he 's right that 's what i 've been doing ever since i can remember . 
no i 'll go through with it . 
it 's no use dad . i practically threw myself at him . 
i do n't know . 
he 's marvelous ! 
he blames you for everything that 's wrong about me . thinks you raised me stupidly . 
he does n't think so much of you either . 
he despises everything i stand for . he thinks i 'm spoiled and pampered and selfish and thoroughly insincere . 
it 'll do no good .   he despises me . 
i do n't know very much about him .   except that i love him . 
on the road . 
sorry dad . i would n't hurt you for the world . you know that . 
oh no . 
oh yes . i heard . 
sorry . must have been day - dreaming . 
oh hello dad . 
i 'll shout to my heart 's content ! i 'll scream if i want to . 
i wo n't thank you ! i 'll never thank you ! 
you 've been telling me what not to do since i was old enough to remember .   i 'm sick of it ! 
your whole life is devoted to just one thing . to accumulate more money . at least there 's romance in what he 's doing . 
why not ?   look what he 's doing for aviation . it takes courage to do what he does . and character ! at least he 's accomplished something worthwhile . i suppose you 'd like to have me marry a business man . well i hate business menparticularly if you 're a shining example . 
he 's one of the best fliers in the country . right now he 's planning a trip to japan . 
you talk as if he were a gigoloor something . 
you only met him once . 
what 've you got against king westley ? 
you 'll never do it ! you ca n't do it ! 
what do you expect to accomplish by all this ? i 'm already married ! 
you 'll have a corpse on your hands ! that what you 'll have . i wo n't eat a thing while i 'm on this boat . 
south america ! 
where are you taking me ? 
i hope you 're not comparing yourself to napoleon . he was a strategist . your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe . 
you ca n't tempt me .   do you hear ? i wo n't eat ! 
smart are n't you ! so subtle . 
you 're wasting your time . i 'm already married to him . 
yes . i know .   because i 'm your daughter and you love me . because you do n't want me to make any mistakes . because 
i wo n't stand for it ! i wo n't stand for your running my life ! why do you insist on it ! 
all right ! put me in chains ! do anything you want !   but i 'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat ! 
why do n't you put me in chains ? 
i do n't want to eat !   and there 's one more thing i do n't want ! definitely ! that 's to see you . 
why do n't you stay and watch the fun ? you 'll enjoy it immensely . 
i hope you got your money . 
i do n't care . i love you . nothing else matters . we can run away . everything'll take care of itself .   please peter . you ca n't go out of my life now . i could n't live without you .   oh peter 
i love you . 
yes . have n't you thought about it at all ? seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy . 
have n't you ever wanted to fall in love ? 
why not ? 
thank you .   am i going to see you in new york ? 
yes . you 'll have a great story wo n't you ? 
i could n't arrive in new york at three in the morning . everybody 's in bed . 
that 's swell ! 
what about money ? 
any luck ? 
what 'd you give him for the car ? 
what happened ? 
oh you 've been hurt ! there 's a cut on 
oh peter ! what happened ? are you all right ? 
never !   i 'm going in and ask him 
why not ? i 'm hungry . 
we do n't need forty cars . 
i proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb . 
you might give me a little credit . 
mind your own business . 
you 're such a smart aleck ! nobody can do anything but you . i 'll show you how to stop a carand i wo n't use my thumb . 
yes . but look at all the fun you had .   mind if i try ? 
when you get up to a hundred wake me up . 
here comes a car ! 
you figured that all out yourself huh ? 
oh no ! 
there 's no end to your accomplishments . 
you 're an expert i suppose . 
what if nobody stops for us ? 
i hate the horrid stuff . 
no ! !   it 's a wonder you could n't get me something i can eat . 
need n't rub it in .   what 're you eating ? 
hayin my teeth . 
if it 's just the same to you we 'll sit right here till they come .   got a toothpick ? 
well you 've given me a very good example of the hiking 
what 'd you say we 're supposed to be doing ? 
what are you thinking about ? 
does n't sound very exciting . 
try me . 
was so scaredthat it scared 
i do n't want it now . 
oh peter ! i was so scared . 
i 'll get my clothes all wrinkled . 
i ca n't forget it . i 'm still hungry . 
not if you 're more hungry than scared . 
we 're not going to sleep out here are we ? 
you 're prejudiced . 
and rich people have none of those qualifications i suppose . 
that 's silly . 
of course it is . 
i 'm following you . 
to new york ? 
never ! i 'll get to new york if i have to starve all the way . 
you did n't give that boy all your money ? 
why have n't you ? 
what do you meanstarvation ? 
not as long as i 'm alive . 
i was never built for these moonlight strolls .   why did we have to leave the bus ? 
yes i noticed he was getting a little fat lately .   ouch ! 
poor old shapeley . you should n't have frightened him like that . 
i better go over and see her . 
i refuse to resign ! 
you always want to run everything . 
oh you are ! who made you the manager ? 
how about cinderellaor a real hot love story ? 
you were n't so bad yourself . 
peter warne you 've gone far enough . i wo n't stand being insulted like this another minute . 
yeah and gotten yourself arrested ! 
well you were ! 
he did n't make a pass at me ! i told you a million times ! 
well you do n't have to lose your temper ! 
do n't get excited peter . they just asked a civil question . 
what are you talking about ? 
that 's father at work what 'll i do ?   peter what 'll i do ? 
i 'd change places with a plumber 's daughter any day . 
thanks professor . 
aw now do n't you start telling me i should n't dunk . 
um - hm . we rode around all afternoon . father was frantic . by 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged . 
kingking westley was in it . 
it has its moments . it got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father 's detectives . ii did it once ; actually went shopping without a body - guard . it was swell . i felt absolutely immoral . but it did n't last long . they caught up with me in a department store . i was so mad i ran out the back way and jumped into the first car i saw . guess who was in it ? 
thanks . nurses governesses chaperones even body - guards . oh it 's been a lot of fun . 
it 's a wonder i 'm not panic stricken . 
yes you do . you think i 'm a fool and a spoiled brat . perhaps i am although i do n't see how i can be . people who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way . i never have . on the contrary i 've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom . would you believe it ? this is the first time i 've ever been alone with a man ! 
thanks .   you think this whole business is silly do n't you ? i mean running away and everything . 
he apologized for last night .   said he did n't know we were married . 
must be the spring . 
why you do n't have to apologize mr. warne . you 'll never know how much i appreciate all this . 
nope . no complaints . 
thank you .   my my ! scrambled eggs . 
well i hope you 're not going to dictate whom i can talk to . 
why peter ! do n't you want to hear about our lovely friends ? 
very outspoken too . said i looked funny . was n't that cute ? 
i met some very interesting women at the showers . we got to chatting about this and that . you know how time files . 
i 'll find it myself . 
where is the shower ? 
where 'd you say the showersand thingswere ? 
like this . i have no robe . 
i ca n't go out like this . 
why you sweet thing you . where 'd you get it pressed ? 
what is it ?   why it 's a toothbrush ! thanks .   youyou had it pressed . 
pleased to meet you mr. warne ... 
peter warne ? i do n't like it . 
you 've got a name have n't you ? 
who are you ? 
do you mind putting out the light ? 
smart aleck ! 
you 're not really serious about this are you ? 
that i suppose makes everythinguhquite all right . 
well thank you . thank you very much but you 've been very kind . 
now is n't that just too cute ? there 's a brain behind that face of yours is n't there ? you 've got everything nicely figured out for yourself including this . 
your ego is colossal . 
oh you did ? what am i expected to doleap for joy ? 
i just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband . 
darn clever these armenians . 
are you talking to me ! 
now just a minuteyou can't 
that 's none of your business . 
you have your nerve !   here boy ! 
of course i do . what do you mean 
no . it 'd be useless . father'd get the wire before they would . 
here boy ! 
if you promise not to snap my head off i 'd like to thank you . 
listen if you 'll promise not to do it i 'll pay you . i 'll pay you as much as he will . you wo n't gain anything by giving me away as long as i 'm willing to make it worth your while . i 've got to get to new york without being stopped . it 's terribly important to me . i 'd pay now only the only thing i had when i jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and i had to pawn that to get these clothes . i 'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to new york . 
if you play your cards right you might get some money out of it . 
you 're not going to notify my father are you ? 
i did n't ask for your advice . 
you must have me confused with 
will you please tell me what you 're raving about ! 
what are you talking about ? 
oh thank you . must have fallen out of my pocket . 
my ticket ? 
do n't tell me you did it on my account !   hope you 're not getting any idea that what happened last night is   you need n't concern yourself about me young man . i can take care of myself . 
what are you excited about ? you missed the bus too . 
seems to me i 've already thanked you for that .   what time is the next bus to new york ? 
no thank you .   thank you so much . 
that was foolish of me . why did n't you shove me away ? 
oh thank you .   we 're in jacksonville are n't we ? 
see here can you understand english ! i do n't want it reported !   please stay out of my affairs !   i want to be left alone .   a close - up of peter shows him glaring after her . 
i do n't want it reported ! 
no . i 'd rather you did n't . 
why noi   yes . . . i guess i will . 
no i 've got that all right . but my money . all i have here is four dollars . i 've got to get to new york with it . 
what am i going to do now ? 
what happened ? 
oh my heavens ! it 's gone ! 
i do n't know what you 're raving about young man . and furthermore i 'm not interested . 
yes . tell that man to drive slowly . 
tell that man not to drive so fast . 
i beg your pardon ! 
wo n't i ever see you again ? 
no harm in your coming to see us . 
is that the walls of jericho going up ? 
you sound like a hobo . 
do you know ? 
well i am . 
no it is n't . i 'm hungry andand scared . 
there 's a man here to see you sweetheart . 
maybe i could jump out of the window .   do you think they 'd see me ? 
i 'm out ! i 'm out ! 
why you bully . i believe you would . 
goodnight mr. warne . 
a headline ? you 're not a newspaper man are you ? 
compared to you my friend shapeley 's an amateur .   whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this ! you 're positively the most conceited 
i heard about your stunt . that 's swell king . just think of itthe groom lands on the lawn with a plane . it 's a perfect beginning for the life we 're going to lead . it sets just the right tempo .   come on king . you 're lagging . 
it 's up to you now . i want our life to be full of excitement king . we 'll never let up will we ? never a dull moment . we 'll get on a merry - go - round and never get off . promise you 'll never let me get off ? it 's the only way to live is n't it ? no time to think . we do n't want to stop to think do we ? just want to keep going . 
happy ? why should n't i be happy ? i 'm getting the handsomest man in captivity .   here you are king . let 's drink .   let 's drink to us .   we finally made it did n't we ? 
eight o'clock ! why that 's twelve hours ! 
why that 's ridiculous ! i was on that busi told them to wait ! 
where 's the bus to new york ? 
thank you . 
when does the bus leave ? 
oh thank you . thank you very much .   here . 
can i use your telephone ? i want to talk to new york . 
but ca n't you wait until morning 
why you ca n't put me out in the middle of the 
why he 'll be back . 
is n't he here ? 
get out ! 
if you do n't get out of here i 'll slap that fresh mouth of yours . 
believe you me you bore me to distraction . 
seems to me you 're doing excellently without any assistance . 
or a cover up !   jesus bill do n't you have enough proof of the fbi 's complicity now ? 
no ! ... shaw !   director of the trade mart ?   this is incredible . 
you want facts bill ?   okay .   from 1945 to ' 59 only two u.s. soldiers defect to russia .   from ' 59 to ' 60 seven defect six return one of them another marine a month before oswald .   all of them young men made to seem poor disenchanted . 
i do n't know if it 's coincidence but oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the u2 program from his days at atsugi air base in japan .   six months after he arrives in russia francis gary powers ' u2 spy flight goes down in russia .   that plane was untouchable . powers hinted that oswald could 've given the russians enough data to hit it .   as a direct result the peace summit between khrushchev and eisenhower failed .   i ca n't help thinking of that book seven days in may maybe someone in our military did n't want the peace conference to happen maybe oswald was part of that .   it gets weirder . 
yes but we 're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance .   three years later and he 's still classified ?   they gave us his grammar school records a study of his pubic hairs ... put it in context bill of what we know about oswald .   lonely kid no father unstable childhood high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy joins the marines at 17 .   he learns russian he acts overtly marxist with two other marines but he 's stationed at a top secret base in japan where u2 spy flights over russia originate .   he 's discharged from the marines supposedly because his mother 's sick .   he stays home 3 days then with a $ 1500 ticket from a $ 203 bank account he goes to moscow ... 
i 'm sorry . 
are n't you being a little hard ? 
this is interesting - are you ready for this ?   oswald went to see the fbi two weeks before the assassination .   it seems special agent hosty made three routine visits to his house supposedly to keep an eye on marina oswald . 
bugging the district attorney 's office of new orleans !   it 's outrageous ! 
all i can find out about the williams ' is their tax returns are classified and that bill williams a descendant of the cabots of massachusetts has links through his family and united fruit to the cia and does classified work for bell helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is oswald a defector doing visiting his wife in his house ? williams has a relationship at bell with general walter dornberger another one of the nazis we brought in after the war for our missile program .   he used slave labor to build the v-2 rockets for hitler before bell needed him . 
the oswalds are introduced by george de mohrenschildt to janet and bill williams .   it 's through janet williams in october ' 63 that lee gets the warehouse job right smack on elm street at the book depository which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence . 
equally incongruous is oswald becoming chummy with the white russian community of dallas - all rabid anti- communists . 
the next thing we know he 's living in dallas / ft . worth in october ' 62 working 6 months at jaggars - chiles- stovall a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the u.s. army ... he starts work only days before the government reveals russian missiles in cuba and the crisis explodes .   oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the u2 planes and works alongside a young man who 'd been in the army security agency . 
none either .   it 's bizarre .   it 's next to impossible to get russian sweethearts out .   nor does lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to cuba and russia in ' 63 .   a man who has defected once already .   it 's crazy . 
spas t. raikin a leading member of an anti - communist group . 
the fbi finally gets around to talking to him in dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant communist type . 
none !   the state department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel .   he 's never investigated or charged by the navy for revealing classified information or as far as we know debriefed by the cia . 
but he never writes speaks or does any propaganda for the russians .   he meets marina whose uncle is a colonel in soviet intelligence at a trade union dance ; she thinks he 's russian the way he speaks six weeks later they marry have a daughter . 
finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he 's given 5000 rubles a roomy apartment with a balcony has affairs with local girls . 
negative on his tax records . classified .   first time i know a d.a. ca n't get a tax record .   i put together a list of all the cia files on oswald that were part of the warren report and asked for them .   there are about 1200 documents ...   oswald in the ussr in mexico city oswald and the u2 a cia 201 personnel file a memo from the director on oswald travel and activities - ca n't get one of them .   all classified as secret on the grounds of national security .   it 's real strange . 
oh no !   no !   i ca n't believe it .   i ca n't believe it .   both of them both brothers oh my god ! 
i do n't think so jim ... 
and if you 're wrong ? 
you never talked to me this way before jim garrison .   i 'm not making any threats .   i 'm leaving you .   i 'm taking the kids to my mother 's .   i am - i am . 
oh i do n't know anymore !   i believe there was a conspiracy but not the government .   i just want to raise our children and live a normal life ! i want my life back ! 
i 'm not fighting you jim i 'm just trying to reach you .   you 've changed . 
is it such a chore ?   i do n't understand you . 
jim before this kennedy thing nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children .   the other night jasper tried to show you a drawing .   you did n't even notice he was there .   he came to me bawling his little eyes out .   jim he 's sensitive - he needs more from you . 
you and your government !   what 's the matter with you ?   do n't you have any feelings ?   your daughter !   what kind of man are you ? 
i 'm leaving .   i 'm taking the kids and i 'm leaving !   i wo n't stand it anymore . 
how do you know ?   how do you even know what goes on in this house anymore !   you 're too busy making speeches stirring up every crazed klansman in louisiana after us ! 
our home jim !   a kidnapper a murderer who knows ! 
your daughter 's life was just threatened ! 
a man just called .   he asked her everything ! 
did you enter virginia into a beauty contest ? 
leave us alone for god 's sake !   ... oh it 's lou . 
it 's not funny jim i 'm scared . 
that sounds dandy but it does n't replace a father and a husband on easter day . 
we waited for you ... hours jim . you could have telephoned for god 's sake .   it 's easter !   you promised jim . 
my sympathies . 
you 're missing most of your life jim and you do n't even know it . the kids are missing out too .   it 's not just you making the sacrifice here honey . 
look at the calendar for christ 's sake .   you said a sunday not easter sunday . 
but why in the lord 's name would you do it in the middle of easter sunday when you knew we were ... 
jim come on honey get down on your hands and knees and hunt for jasper 's easter egg . 
do you have any evidence against him jim ?   clay shaw 's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the quarter .   he 's well connected all his friends the money people be careful jim . 
honey go back to sleep please ! 
jim what is going on for heaven 's sake !   you going to stay up all night every night ?   for what ?   so you 'll be the only man in america who read the entire 26 volumes of the warren report ? 
these books are getting to your mind mr. garrison .   i wish you 'd stop readin ' them . 
i can not believe this .   it 's four- thirty jim garrison .   i have five children are gon na be awake in another hour and ... 
honey you all right ? 
one hour y'hear ?   some saturday night date you are .   mama warned me this would happen if i married such a serious man . 
well maybe you 're right jim .   i 'll give you one hour to solve the case ... until the kids are in bed .   then you 're mine and mr. kennedy can wait ' til morning .   come on everybody say goodnight to daddy . 
come on now we 'll talk about it at the table dinner 's getting cold .   what are you doing in here ? 
jim dinner 's just about ready ... i 've got a surprise for you ... tried something new ... jim ?   jim dinner . 
i keep thinking of that day tuesday the 26th the day after they buried kennedy l.b.j. was signing the memorandum on vietnam with ambassador lodge . 
it never did . 
does it matter ?   another technician . but an interesting thing - he was there that day in dealey plaza .   you know how i know ?   that picture of yours .   the hoboes ... you never looked deep enough ... 
you never ask a spook a question . no point .   he 'll never give you a straight answer .   general y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more . 
... got promoted to two stars but he was never military you know always cia .   went to vietnam lost his credibility when we got beat over there retired lives in virginia . i say hello to him when i see him at the supermarket ... 
... do n't think so .   when they start to drool they get rid of 'em .   these guys are proud of what they did . they did dealey plaza !   they took out the president of the united states !   that 's entertainment !   and they served their country doing it . 
he 's done it before .   other countries . lumumba in the congo trujillo the dominican republic he 's working on castro .   no big deal .   in september kennedy announces the texas trip . at that moment second oswalds start popping up all over dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket .   y flies in the assassins maybe from the special camp we keep outside athens greece - pros maybe some locals cubans maria hire separate teams .   does it really matter who shot from what rooftop ?   part of the scenery .   the assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone ... 
i think it started in the wind . money - arms big oil pentagon people contractors bankers politicians like l.b.j. were committed to a war in southeast asia .   as early as ' 61 they knew kennedy was going to change things ... he was not going to war in southeast asia .   who knows ? probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - houston new york - hell maybe bonn germany ... who knows it 's international now . 
you did n't get that break you needed but you went as far as any man could bubba .   what can i do for you ? 
but you do n't have a choice anymore . you 've become a significant threat to the national security structure . they would 've killed you already but you got a lot of light on you . instead they 're gon na destroy your credibility ; they already have in many circles in this town .   you 're some kinda ego - crazed southern caricature to many folks .   be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case something anything make arrests stir the shitstorm . you got ta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack .   remember fundamentally people are suckers for the truth and the truth is on your side ' bubba . i hope you get a break ... 
no chance in hell mr. garrison . i 'd be arrested and gagged declared insane and hospitalized ... maybe worse .   you too .   i can only give you background you got to find the foreground the little things ... keep digging .   y'know you 're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of john kennedy .   that 's important - it 's historic . 
kings are killed mr. garrison . politics is power nothing more . but do n't believe me .   do n't trust me .   do your own work your own thinking . 
i 'm not with the agency mr. garrison and i assume if you 've come this far what i have to say interests you .   but i 'm not going to name names or tell you who or what i represent . except to say - you 're close you 're closer than you think ... 
i could give you a false name but i wo n't .   just call me x. 
i 'm glad you came .   i 'm sorry about the precautions . 
jim garrison ? 
i 'm sorry i just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform . 
i think i 'm gon na just get this for today . i 'm in kind of a hurry . would you mind ringing this up while i change out of it ? 
this looks pretty good on me . 
yes you have a suit i 've had my eye on . 
but you 're not going to stop her ? 
he would n't say . you gon na follow her ? 
four thirty . i 'm meeting a woman . 
can you do it or not ? 
' course i do -- i deliver money for him . 
help you get ordell robbie . 
take your time . 
i 'm tellin ' you i do n't know nothin' about that fuckin ' shit . 
that 's my diet shit . 
beauty products . 
my pocketbook . 
help yourself . 
i 'm not a loser . 
arrest me . 
i 'm not saying another word . 
suspicion of what ? 
would i mind ? do i have a choice ? 
i doubt it .   who 's your friend ? 
the usual things . i 'm a flight attendant with cabo air . 
are you scared of me ? 
i thought you were tired of your business ? 
sure i ca n't twist your arm ? 
wanna go ? 
start off in madrid . ever been there ? 
i 'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money . 
do you blame yourself for helping me ? 
we 're partners . 
i never lied to you . 
i did n't use you max . 
they 've confiscated all his other stuff . but this one 's sorta left over . the registration 's in the glove box the keys were under the seat ... what 's a matter have n't you ever borrowed someone 's car ? 
i told him i might . 
i saw ray the other day . boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement . 
you worked for it -- if you 're sure that 's all you want . 
only this is n't a bail bond max . 
yeah your fee . i had to figure that out since there was n't no note . 
i got your package . it was fun getting a half - a - million dollars in the mail . 
well we do n't let that happen now do we ? 
he 's already there . 
ordell called and wants to meet me and i 'm scared . 
i 've chickened out . i 'm afraid of him . he 'll like that . 
tell him i want to give him his money . 
uh - huh . 
get ordell to come to your office . 
it never was so i 'm not gon na start worrying about it now . look ray more or less believes my story and he more or less does n't care . all he really gives a shit about is getting ordell . 
that 's why a.t.f. 's got ta make the case . i 'm their witness . they would n't have a case without me . if it 's his word against mine who are they gon na believe ? 
ray wants him . 
he 's liable to shoot you . 
how does winston find him if a.t.f. and all the local police ca n't ? 
how 'd you find out ? 
well a suit . there 's one i had my eye on . 
that 's why you do n't make a move till i come out of the fitting room . 
yeah but i 'm not in jail and i tried . 
not really . if he finds it i say mr. walker put the money in and i did n't know nothing about it . like the coke . 
he wo n't -- i mean he did n't the last time . he 'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top . 
in the bag underneath . 
well you know i 'm not going to show him the whole amount . he 'll see fifty thousand . 
do n't be so literal . ray believed it . 
all he needed was a reasonable explanation . 
oh yeah . i got them thinking ordell 's real nervous . they love thinking he 's scared of them . 
i told them ordell 's changed the amount he 's bringing in . 
that 's what you do to go through with the shit you start . you rationalize . i can do this max i know i can . but i ca n't do it without you . 
it may be evidence once they get their hands on it but right now it 's only money . 
what if i 've figured a way ? 
if you had a chance unemployed now to walk off with a half - million dollars would you take it ? 
i 'm not sure you answered my question . 
and is that it ? 
did you do it that night ? 
you do that ? 
what do you do when he comes home ? 
wait a minute . after we were together you went and snuck into a guy 's house ? 
the day you got me out of jail ? 
when did you decide ? 
you 're avoiding the question . 
you know where it came from . it 's not like it 's anybody 's life savings . it would n't even be missed . 
no i mean you right now . not it you were somebody else . 
what about you max ? 
he tries to act cool . 
he were n't bullshittin ' either 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire . 
not really . but i knew this narcotics cop one time . told me that in a raid the whole package never gets back to the station . his exact words . 
you do n't propose something like that unless you 're pretty sure the other person 's into it . 
he 's setting me up to make a proposition . 
maybe . but i 'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself . 
i know i got your message . ray wanted to have dinner . he wanted to talk about the sting we 're plotting . that 's what he calls it . a sting . he 's being real nice to me . 
yeah we were goin' over everything . that 's why all the bags . 
i 'm helping him bring his money into america . he loves the idea . you just missed him . 
right around here in the food court . 
he always just picked it up at my place . but with a.t.f. involved i want to stage it . you know make it look more intriguing like we know what the fuck we 're doin' . then it 's up to ray nicolet the a.t.f. guy to follow the shopping bag . 
yea but i 'm going to dress it up . put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone i meet here . 
they seem to like the idea . 
i go back to work tomorrow . 
how old 's annette ? 
who was your girl before annette ? 
and annette 's it for you ? 
does it happen to all men ? 
oh are you ? does she know that ? 
how was it ? 
what 'd ya see ? 
i know ignoring me . what 're you up to ? 
well i 've flown seven million miles . and i 've been waitin ' on people almost twenty years . the best job i could get after my bust was cabo air which is about the worst job you can get in this industry . i make about sixteen thousand with retirement benefits ai n't worth a damn . and now with this arrest hanging over my head i 'm scared . if i lose my job i got ta start all over again but i got nothin' to start over with . i 'll be stuck with whatever i can get . and that scares me more than ordell . 
i just feel like i 'm always starting over . you said how many bonds you wrote ? 
my ass ai n't the same . 
it 's different with men . 
how 'd you feel about it ? 
i 'm asking how you feel . does it bother you ? 
how do you feel about getting old ? 
i ai n't goin' to jail and i ai n't doin' that probation thing again . 
if i get let off . otherwise fuck 'em . 
same way i been doin' but first they got to let me go back to work . 
he needs me . without me all that money is just gon na sit over there in cabo . sugar ? 
he had his doubts at first . but he 's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can . 
we talked . 
he came by . 
he told me last night . 
it 's a lot of money . about a half - a- million dollars . all of it in cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin ' in . 
i want to talk to them first . i know more now about ordell 's money . 
i do n't know yet . i 'm going to talk with dargus and nicolet today . do what you suggested . offer to help and see what happens . 
i called in sick this morning . as far as the airline knows i 'm still available . 
' 74 i think . 
the delfonics . 
uh - huh . 
i got a few . but i ca n't afford to start all over again . i got too much time and money invested in my records . 
i could n't wait till i got home last night and wash my hair . 
want to hear some music ? 
what i could n't hear you ? 
thanks but i have my own now . 
i felt a lot safer having it . my milk went bad when i was in jail . 
i am . have a seat . 
i think maybe i have more options than i thought . 
but if all i can give 'em is ordell 's name -- i do n't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- that do n't give me much to bargain with . 
yeah if i cooperate . 
whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened . this ai n't solvin ' my problem . i got ta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble . i 'm off today but if i ca n't leave the country i 'm out of a job . and if i do n't got a job i ca n't hire a lawyer . 
that 's it . he 's cash poor . he kept on me till i finally said okay . i 'll bring whatever fits in a nine - by- twelve envelope . i got paid five hundred dollars and his friend mr. walker in mexico gave me the envelope . 
it 's all in lock boxes in a mexico bank . but he 's got a problem . he 's -- what do you call it when you got money but do n't have cash ? 
with ten thousand ? nine . 
i used to bring over ten thousand at a time . that 's the legal limit so i never brought more than that . 
i have a pretty good idea . ordell ai n't no bootlegger and i doubt he 's smugglin ' cuban cigars . so that only leaves one thing an a.t.f. man would be interested in . 
it was the other guy who busted me . 
ray nicolet with alcohol tobacco and firearms . 
i did n't ? 
the federal agent kinda half hinted ordell might of done beaumont . 
ordell pick up his bond ? 
that 's him . how do you know 'em ? 
who gave me the money and who i was giving it to . and some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off . said it was him who told them 'bout me . 
i had 'em too . i burnt those two starky and hutch motherfuckers down . then their asses lucked out and found that coke . 
so far i 've been told i can cooperate and get probation maybe . or i can stand mute and get as much as five years . does that sound right ? 
you 're not tired of it ? 
she was more helpful than the fuckin ' public defender .   i do n't know -- i guess what i need is a lawyer find out what my options are . 
davidoffs . i get 'em in mexico . they 're hard to find here . i was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin ' her boyfriend 's head open with a baseball bat . 
that 's why i do n't quit . if i ca n't fly anymore i 'm gon na have a bitch of a time gettin ' my brand . 
you gain weight ? 
'cause i look like i just got outta jail that 's why . you droppin ' me off at home right ? there 's a place by me . 
that does n't sound dark . 
is it dark ? 
i 'd love one but not there . 
could n't we just stop at a seven- eleven ? 
i do n't think so . 
can we stop for cigarettes ? 
who put up my bond ? ordell ? 
can i see your i.d. ? 
are you really a bail bondsman ? 
if i do n't cooperate ? 
what if i plead guilty ? 
who 's side are you on ? 
you tell those guys they 'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before i 'll even say ' hi ' to them . 
well sheronda it was nice talking to you . 
you know what 's in the bag you 're taking ? 
then you do n't see him for a few days ? 
not every day ? 
do you live together ? 
do you think i took some of that money ? 
what about me ? 
so what happens now ? 
i thought you were watching him . 
if it 'll make you happy . 
i have no idea . 
i did n't see him . i was in my underwear . if it was a white guy it was probably louis . he kill melanie ? 
not in the fitting room . 
i went looking for you . i went straight to the bookstore 'cause that 's where you were last time but you were n't there . how the hell else am i supposed to let anybody know what happened ? you did n't tell me how to do that did you ? i knew i was under surveillance so when i could n't spot anybody i started yelling . 
i had to . i was frantic . i did n't know what to do . 
she did n't give me one . i told you before melanie was n't part of the plan . ordell must of told her to do it . she bursts in grabs the shopping bag and takes off . what am i supposed to do go after her ? i 'm in my fucking underwear . i had to get dressed before i could do anything . so i put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than i could my uniform . 
because i did n't have it . ray i swear melanie came in and grabbed it .   and someone killed her for it . 
i got there early . i 've had my eye on this suit -- wait let 's start over . i got there early . the idea was to try on the suit see if i liked it . if i did get them to wrap it up and change back into my uniform . that 's what sheronda 's expecting me to wear . go meet sheronda give her the bag with fifty thousand and go home . 
i thought i did . 
how can i do anything if i 'm being watched every second ? 
that would be one point of view . 
yes . all those things are true . 
uh - huh . 
ever been tempted ? 
i never have . it 's not my money . 
i was told ten thousand in each pack . 
we could if i 'm not in jail . 
you said that the last time . 
right . everything 's the same except one change ... 
uh - huh . 
she did n't say . 
uh - huh . 
i smiled and walked away . she also told me ordell killed beaumont . 
i 'm sure that was the idea . 
it was her coke i got busted with . she knows everything but she 's not part of it and she 's pissed cause she 's not part of it . ordell would n't even let her stay at the meeting . she tried to talk me into ripping off ordell . 
white girl named melanie ralston . another girlfriend of ordell 's . 
not yet . 
i imagine shit needs to be done . 
what for ? 
not really . 
this afternoon before i came here . he was with ordell at an apartment in hermosa beach . i do n't know if he lives there but i can find out . 
ordell has a white guy working for him named louis . 
a broadway shopping bag . 
i thought you were going to let this one through . 
what are you doing ? 
short of wearing a wire i 'll do everything i can to help you throw his ass in jail . and in exchange for my help i need permission to leave the country and immunity . 
he told me . besides why else would an a.t.f. man be after him ? 
he sells guns . 
you never asked me if i did or not . 
if i 'm working i can help you . 
i need it tomorrow . if i do n't show up for work tomorrow i 'm fired . 
i need permission to leave the country so i keep my job . 
can i smoke ? 
look that shit ai n't mine . 
you planted that shit on me . 
what the fuck is that shit ? 
now be careful with that bag . you do n't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store . 
i put a little cherry on top . you 're right . what the hell he ever do for us ? 
do you got something for me ? 
yeah do you like it ? 
hi melanie . 
i do n't think so but thanks for the beer . 
keep it between us girls ? 
beaumont livingston ? 
he said he did n't know about it . 
that coke was yours was n't it ? 
what were you two fighting about ? 
how long you been with ordell ? 
uh - uh . 
killian 's . 
well i guess i better look for another one then . thanks anyway . 
i 'm waiting for the phone . 
oh hi . 
he wo n't know where the money came from . only that it 's money . 
give it to the bail bondsman max cherry . he 'll take care of it . 
and a hundred thousand if i go to jail . 
if i was n't this would n't work . now once i deliver i 'll have to trust you . 
ray the a.t.f. guy . 
where you gon na be during all this ? 
the fitting room . there 's a sign over the door . 
designer clothes . 
right the one simone gives me . simone and i 'll make the switch at robinson's / may. she knows what i look like ? 
what does she think she 's gettin ? 
are you sure she do n't know about the money ? 
it washes off . i tell them we 're doing it the same way as before . they 'll follow sheronda . i hate the idea of leaving her for a fall . 
nicolet and dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills . 
not when it 's my ass on the line you do n't . we do this my way or fuck it . 
i know but i hung around 'cause i figured you 'd try an ' pull some shit like this . 
i was there i saw her do it . 
sheronda passin ' the money onto someone else that 's what the hell i 'm talkin ' 'bout . 
i do n't want no more fuckin ' surprises . we do this the way i laid it out or we do n't do it at all . 
i need to talk to you alone . 
look it 's my ass facin ' the penitentiary . you send some hard- headed roc whore and she fucks things up . 
the money 's in a broadway shopping bag . i get some food and sit down here in the food court . then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet ? 
plus the same deal as before . 
that 's an agent . manager 's get fifteen percent . 
i ai n't your partner i 'm your manager . i 'm managing to get your money out of mexico into america in your hands and i 'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops . that makes me your manager and managers get fifteen percent . 
well it 's my plan . we 're in this together . 
i was thinkin ' the del amo mall . in the food court . 
can you cover that ? 
that 's the idea . 
no i give it to someone else first . 
the next trip when i come with all the money it 'll look like i hand it to the same one i did before ... 
if you want . 
i do n't know . one of your friends . 
if you just listen you 'll see it 's a damn good idea . the first time i do it they 're lurking about . they see me hand the ten thousand to someone . 
you do n't have to . i told 'em you 're real careful . you never pick up money yourself . you always send someone and i never know who it is . 
... i make two deliveries . the first one with ten thousand like a dry run . they watch it . see how it works . then we do a second delivery when i bring in the half mill . 
they know i 'm delivering for you . i mention the half - million -- they do n't give a fuck about that -- they want you with guns . so i say well if you want proof he 's getting paid for selling them let me bring the money in . 
it 's true is n't it ? 
i told them you got a half a million dollars in mexico and you want me to bring it here . 
look the only way i can get permission to fly is if i agree to help them . which is what i have to appear to be doing . so i give them something they already know . you . 
they already know it 's you . 
i told them . 
i do n't think so but it do n't really matter . they know i 'm meeting you . 
i do okay . 
it 's a cockatoo . 
it 's right on hawthorne boulevard and manhattan beach boulevard . it 's red brick ... 
the cockatoo inn . 
i 'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it 's on . 
i been thinkin about that too and i got me a idea . 
all your money 's in mexico . 
one hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name if i 'm convicted up to a year or put on probation . if i have to do more than a year you pay another hundred thousand . 
it 's okay . i forgive you . now let 's say if i tell on you i walk . and if i do n't i go to jail . 
let 's get realistic baby . sooner or later they 're gon na get around to offering me a plea deal and you know that . that 's why you came here to kill me . 
way i see it me and you only got one thing to talk about . what you willing to do for me ? 
shut your raggedy ass up and sit down . 
go sit over in that chair . 
i said you understand what i 'm saying 
well i ai n't playin with you . i 'm gon na unload both these motherfuckers you do n't do what i tell you . understand what i 'm saying ? 
the cops did n't try and strangle my ass . 
shut your ass up and grab the wall ! 
you thought right ... now take your hands from around my throat nigga . 
what do you think it is ? 
they told me . 
i did n't tell 'em anything . 
and they asked if i knew mr. walker . 
beaumont livingston . 
i said i wanted to talk to a lawyer . 
they asked . 
the same guy who put me in thanks a lot . 
for what ? 
i got some vodka in the freezer . 
i was expecting you . come in . 
you betcha . 
it looks good on you . 
are you getting that black suit ? 
what 's that fucker ever done for us ? 
you know how easy it would be ? he wo n't be anywhere near that mall . pull one more switch up front . that 's it . half - a - million dollars . need help ? 
you think i 'm kidding ? 
so tell me . having all that money in your flight bag -- is it tempting ? 
you already knew that ? 
he killed a guy who works for him the other day . 
you believe that ? yeah well i guess you have to trust him .   i 'd have second thoughts on that but then i know 'em . 
mr. walker 's my buddy . ask him about ordell . 
this time ? almost a year . i 've known him forever . 
gimme one anyway . 
better get me another sam 's .   join me in a jaeger shot ? 
great ...   ... wanda ! 
good luck . that guy 's been in there since i got here . 
buy ya a beer ? 
okay lou - is . 
you sure ? 
is it this aisle or the next one over ? 
you sure ? 
is it this aisle lou - is ? 
okay you got it . just take a chill pill for christ sake . 
watch it dipshit . you wanna rip the fuckin ' bag ? 
fuck you . i can carry it . 
i 'm getting out of here . what do you think ?

that 's a nice outfit on her . i 'm gon na go over and look at this michi moon display . 
jesus christ get a grip louis . 
all right already . 
... and just take it from him . 
let him and that stewardess get that money over here ... 
course he did he tells everybody who 'll listen . that 's what he 's doin' with this stewardess . he 's scheming how he can get it over here . 
i live here . he drops in and out . he tell you about that half - million dollars he 's got in mexico ? 
he went to meet that stewardess . 
that 's not what i 'm saying at all .   you know where he went ? 
he killed a man worked for him the other night . 
well so far he is . but you have to admit he 's not too bright . 
is it dead ? 
now that 's over let 's get to know each other . 
wanna fuck ? 
not really . we did n't have much to say to each other anyway . i never got to know him that well but i knew enough to know i was n't missing much . i keep that because of all the fuckin ' time i was there that 's the only picture i got of me in japan .   that 's japan . 
i never got to know him really . i could n't speak japanese and his english was terrible . but i could n't say anything because his english was better than my japanese . 
that 's the guy i lived with ... his name was ... hirosh . 
about five years ago . 
i lived there for about nine months . 
that 's a picture of me in japan . 
did you ever go i one ? 
c'm on do n't lie . 
were you a disco guy ? 
with ordell ? 
where were you ? 
the beach . or get high drop acid at a friend 's place . i was a k.l.o.s. girl . i hated disco . 
noooo i was a surfer girl . besides i was only fourteen . i could n't go to discos . 
i was pretty much the same height now as i was then . 
which one ? 
no it 's what body builders drink to beef up . 
it 's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal . 
want a metrix ? 
coughing opens up the capillaries . when you cough you 're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that do n't normally get used . coughing 's good -- gets ya higher . my dad coughs when he smokes all the time . 
you okay ? 
yeah there 's another hit left . 
really i 'm impressed . 
what for ? 
four years ? 
how long ? 
where at ? 
when did you get out of jail ? 
want a hit ? 
he 's just repeating shit he overheard . he ai n't any more a gun expert than i am . 
he thinks he 's joe gunn now . 
it 's boring is n't it ? 
no problem .

you look terrible . what happened ?   jake ... is it the antidote ? 
jake what is it ? 
you look upset . 
what 'd you do that for ? it 's an in- teresting story . all these people are still disappearing . right off the street .   hey what 's wrong ? are you all right ? 
you son - of - a - bitch . who do you think you are ? i do n't deserve this . who takes care of you day and night ? who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear ? well i 've had it . you flip out on your own you ungrateful bastard . i 'm done holding your hand . i do n't want anything to do with you you hear ? nothing ! 
you 're out of your fucking mind . i 'm not gon na stand around here gettin ' interrogated by you .

cause you know goddamn well who i am . 
it 's going to be all right jake . it 's going to be all right . do n't be afraid . i 've got you now . 
so tell me ... am i still an angel ? 
you know who i am . 
how many times have you asked me that ? how many times ? 
you have quite a mind jake . i loved your friends . that chemist - the ladder . what an imagination you have ! 
what 's wrong jake ?   forget to take your antidote ? 
your capacity for self - delusion is remarkable dr. singer .

i can waitress . i 'm good . 
i want to go with you jake . wherever you go . 
this is one of my dreams jake . ever since i was a little girl . i never thought it would happen . 
it 's so hard to believe . 
it 's amazing you know that a drug could change things like that destroy a life and then give it back . it 's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next . 
what 's gotten into you ? 
god i ca n't keep up with all your changes . 
are you out of your mind ? 
what are you doing here ? are you all right ? how do you expect to pay for this ?   everyone 's looking for you jake . i dodged people all over the place reporters police . i do n't know what you 're gon na do . 
how do you know he 's telling the truth ? 
who was that ? 
hello ... no . he 's not here . i have n't seen him all night ... i do n't know when ... what ? tell him what ?   vietnam ? ... what experiments ? 
it might be for me . 
why are you doing this to me ? you ca n't just go away like that . 
i want to know . you tell me ! 
where were you jake ? where 've you been ? why have n't you called ? 
who else were you expecting ? 
it 's just me . 
baby i 'm sorry . i feel terrible . i 'd stay and talk but i 'm so late . look do n't be upset . we 'll talk when i get home . see you around midnight .   bye . and do n't brood . watch t.v. or something . 
i do n't know . that 's all he said . he was n't very friendly . oh yeah . he said your buddies backed down . they chickened out he said . 
he said you did n't have one . 
he did n't give me a chance .   look honey do n't get upset but he 's not taking your case . 
while you were in the shower . 
i put a frozen dinner in the oven a manhandler . it 'll be ready at a quarter of . i threw a little salad together . it 's in the fridge . i also bought some apple juice red cheek . do n't drink it all . oh and jake your lawyer called . 
how come ? the army ? 
remember that . 
i know . 
we 're all angels you know ...   ... and devils . it 's just what you choose to see . 
so tell me ... am i still an angel ? 
look i 'm horny . keep it in mind .   love me a little ? 
you know you really ought to get out today . you ca n't just sit around like this all the time . it 's not healthy . it 's not good for your mind . go take a walk or somethin' . go to a movie . christ who 's gon na know ? you think i care ? i do n't give a shit . go . enjoy yourself . one of us should be having a good time .   hello ! anybody home ?   anybody in there ? 
you 're right here jake . you just rest .   the doctor said you had a virus . that 's what they say when they do n't know what it is . you ca n't do anything for a week . he says you got ta recuperate .   now you just lie here . mrs. sandelman made you some chicken soup . it 'll warm you up . 
jake you are never out of your head ! 
the best . 
a good lay . 
you sold your soul remember ? that 's what you told me . 
i do n't let anybody call me that . 
well personally i never went for church names . 
they 're weird names . 
no . the little one . 
your kid dropped it off . 
maybe you left 'em in the bathroom . 
did you look around the headboard ? 
where 'd you leave 'em ? 
you up ? 
what happened to you ? 
it is tomorrow . four a.m. how come you 're so late ? 
the room ! 
what do you think ? 
that help ? 
i moved the couch . that 's all . 
where are you ? 
gee thanks a lot . 
why did n't you turn on the light ? 
jake is that you ? 
no for real . i think you are the coolest person i 've ever met . and you do n't even have to try . 
also i think i 'm in love with you . 
you know i 've been thinking . i 'm really sorry i was such a huge bitch to you . you did n't deserve that . you never deserve any of the poo i unload on you . 
because they 're your fave . and you can never have too much of your favorite one - calorie breath mint . 
yeah . that was me . 
oh . it 's fine . what 's another ten pounds ? 
well at least you do n't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater . i 'm a planet ! 
what ? are you ashamed that we did it ? 
i still have your virginity ! 
forget it bleek . take katrina the douche packer to the prom . i 'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin ' time ! 
why ? because i got bored and had sex with you one day and then i did n't like marry you ? 
that 's not how our thing works ! i hurl the accusations and you talk me down remember ? 
i 'm not mad . i 'm in a fucking great mood . despite the fact that i 'm trapped in a fat suit i ca n't take off despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday ... 
your mom must be really glad you 're not taking me . 
leah just told me you were going with her . 
are you honestly and truly going to prom with katrina de voort ? 
i totally heard you did . 
what about katrina de voort ? you could go out with katrina de voort . 
were we together ? 
yeah . sure . once tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go . 
jesus bleek . 
i 'm going to really start looking like a dork soon . will you still think i 'm cute if i 'm huge ? 
i asked my dad and bren not to narc us out to your folks so we should be safe . 
the guy is super cool ! his name is mark and he 's into old horror movies and he plays guitar . i actually hung out with him today . 
yeah . um i hooked up a whole private adoption thing . these married people in saint cloud are going to be the parents . 
i just wanted to come over . you know say hi . i miss hanging out with you on school nights . 
i 'll try to drop by later . 
sorry bleek ... going for my ultrasound . got ta note and everything . 
oh yeah . i 'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner huh ? 
oh i could n't copy your work . 
well ! nothing like experimenting . 
i 'll see you at school o.k. ? 
i 'm real sorry i had sex with you . i know it was n't your idea . 
so that 's cool with you then ? 
i thought i might you know nip it in the bud before it gets worse . because i heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant . 
i know . 
when i see them all running like that with their things bouncing around in their shorts i always picture them naked even if i do n't want to . i have intrusive thoughts all the time . 
i 'm pregnant . 
go carole .   so guess what ? 
your shorts are looking especially gold today . 
yeah i swiped it from ms. rancick . 
hey bleek . 
it really did n't hurt that bad having him . 
you mean i have to wait for it to get even worse ? why ca n't they just give it to me now ? 
ow ow fuckity - ow . bren when do i get that spinal tap thing ? 
wow dream big ! 
we do n't even have a dog ! 
you do n't know anything about me ! 
listen bren - duhhh i think you 're the one overstepping boundaries . you 're acting like you 're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else . besides who cares if he 's married ? i can have friends who are married . 
i do n't know i just did . and while we were waiting for vanessa mark and i watched the wizard of gore and he burned me some cds of weird music . he 's kind of cool . 
they said they wanted to know about this stuff . they said to keep them updated so i did ! 
i drove to st. cloud to show mark and vanessa the ultrasound . and i wound up staying for a couple of hours . 
cool it . 
well i 'm not ready to be a mom . 
but they have a real lawyer and everything . i 'm going to meet with them next weekend . 
but i 'm going to give it up for adoption . i already found the perfect people . 
no . the school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion . 
i have no idea how to spit this out . 
i would never barf in your urn brenda . maybe l.b. did it . 
shit yeah . close it up . 
yeah . yeah ! the way people used to do it . quick and dirty like ripping off a band - aid . 
oh . uh my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said i was twelve weeks . 
i 'm a junior . 
not really . i 'm sixteen . i 'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a - holes ! 
please do n't get a divorce ! god mark just do me a solid and stay with your wife . 
yeah but did n't you love vanessa when you married her ? if you love someone once you can love them again i know it . my friend leah has gone out with the same guy like four times . you 're just not trying . 
yeah i guess ... is this my fault ? is vanessa mad at you because of me ? 
i do n't know . i just liked being your friend . i sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life . 
but you 're old ! 
i want you guys to adopt the buglet . i wanted everything to be perfect . not shitty and broken like everyone else 's family . listen once i have the baby vanessa is going to finally be happy and everything will be all right . believe me on this one ! 
this is n't what we agreed on . you guys have to take care of ... this ! you are the chosen custodians of the big - ass bump ! 
no . no you definitely can not do that mark . that 's a big fat sack of no ! 
i do n't know . 
only squares and nerds go to dances . 
oh okay . like this . 
oh man i can just picture you slow dancing like a dork ! 
that 's almost interesting mark . who did you dance with ? 
you do ? 
wow i actually feel like less of a fat dork now . 
oh god you 're one of those guys ... 
oh mark ! is this the baby 's room ? it 's beautiful ! 
is vanessa here ? 
okay stop surfing porn and get back to work . just wanted to say hi . 
consider it your musical education . 
well when you 're used to the raw power of iggy and the stooges everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison . 
i sort of like it . i mean it 's cute . 
so i 've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird cd you made me . 
you should have gone to china . i heard they give away babies like free ipods . they shoot 'em out of those t - shirt guns at sports events . 
hey what kind of swag did you score ? 
i came over as soon as i got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis . my stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises . 
i 'll handle this . i 'm really good at diffusing mom - type rage . 
why ? what the big deal ? 
i weighed my options . but after all this i 'm glad i did n't you know get rid of it . i want to have it . for you guys . 
uh thanks . 
my dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with greek and roman mythology . he named me after zeus 's wife . i mean zeus had other lays but i 'm pretty sure juno was his only wife . she was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean . like diana ross . 
madison ? is n't that kind of ... i do n't know gay ? 
so have you and vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet ? 
this is even better than suspiria . you 've got decent taste in slasher movies mark . 
frankly this looks kind of stupid . 
please . dario argento is the ultimate master of horror . 
the wizard of gore ? 
i did n't . but it 's a three - way tie between the stooges patti smith and the runaways . 
you do n't have to do that . 
hey i like this . 
i 've heard the carpenters before . chick drummer and freaky dude . not unlike the white stripes . 
what is it ? 
well do n't worry about it . my stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy . she wo n't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red m&ms . hope you 're ready . 
you know ... it 's parts ... 
that 's what you think . i drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter - babies that 's born without junk . 
the doctor can tell but i decided not to know . i want it to be a big surprise . 
no he 's the dad . 
i think it kind of looks like my friend paulie . 
behold good sir ! the very first photo of your future child . 
you 're kind of a sellout are n't you ? what would the melvins say ? 
titanium power ! get more snatch by the batch ! 
like what ? 
no shit . like johannes brahms ? 
why are n't you at work ? 
sure . what is it with you rich people and your herb - infused juices ? 
right . i hear they can be kind of a time - suck . 
i 've got something really cool to show you guys . is vanessa here ? 
that 's all right . my axe is named roosevelt . after franklin not ted . franklin was the hot one with the polio . 
your guitar is named kimber ? 
nuh - uh 1977 ! punk volume 1 . you were n't there so you ca n't understand the magic . 
when was this like ' 96 ? 
what is that mahogany ? what happens if you crack the neck ? 
what ? i 'm a pawn shop rocker . 
i rock a harmony . 
it 's beautiful . i 've always liked gibson better than fender . 
wow you get a whole room in your own house ? she 's got you on a long leash there mark . 
blood and guts . 
you should be happy holmes . i 'm giving you and vanessa the gift of life . sweet screaming pooping life ! and you do n't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in ... 
i did steal a squirt of perfume . what do you think ? it 's clinique happy . 
well you do n't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised . i could be a total klepto for all you know . 
did your wife send you up here to spy on me ? 
whoops ! yikes i did n't expect to see you up here . 
whoah . i do n't want to see pictures . i do n't need to be notified of anything . ca n't we just kick it old school ? i could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way . you know like moses in the reeds . 
well i just have the baby and give it to you right ? 
geeeerta rauuuss ! 
really ? fingernails ? 
well it was nice seeing you . 
you should try adderall . 
good . i 'm good .   did you finish that paper for worth 's class yet ? 
uh hi su - chin . 
i 'm not crying . i 'm allergic to fine home furnishings . see you later . 
are you kidding ? everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly . i 'm like a legend . they call me the cautionary whale . 
happy ? oh you mean like physically . i 'm good . look i have a snooze button now ! 
please excuse leah . she 's mentally challenged . 
well hi vanessa ! what brings you to the mall today ? 
naah . i 'm already pregnant so they figure nothing worse could happen to me . i got ta bounce anyway . it was nice seeing you guys again . 
what do you mean ? you mean ...   do you think i 'm going to flake out on you ? 
i thought people got all that stuff at baby showers . when my stepmom had my sister i remember she got about a million presents . they were all lame though so i was n't jealous . 
this is the baby . your baby . 
sure . it 's the right size and everything . i even saw its phalanges today ! check this ... 
i went to the doctor today . 
look if i could give it to you now i would . but it probably looks like a sea monkey at this point so i think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter you know ? 
i 'm going to say i 'm 104 % sure . 
oh . sure . of course you 'd want to know how your kid is cooking . 
room with a toilet got it . 
can i use the facilities first ? being pregnant makes you pee like seabiscuit . 
well you 're lucky it 's not you . 
yeah but i hardly noticed it . i 'm more worried about the part where i have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front . 
yeah apparently . i 'm having it on may 4 . 
a maker 's mark please . up . 
wicked pic in the penny saver by the way . super classy . not like those other people with the fake woods in the background . like i 'm really going to fall for that you know ? 
vanessa right ? 
no thank you . i 'm off sex . 
juno macguff . 
hi . i 'm here for the big show ? 
thundercats are go ! 
either i just pissed my pants or ... 
i sort of already have . 
dad it 's not about that . i just need to know that it 's possible for two people to stay happy together forever . or at least for a few years . 
please stop now . 
dad no ! 
yeah like people in love . 
i guess i wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good . 
i 'm losing my faith in humanity . 
yeah she does . 
tot ice skating ? tots ca n't ice skate . liberty bell 's still getting the hang of stairs . 
dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level . where is everyone ? 
hi dad . 
well no ... i 'm not going to sell the baby . i just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents . i 'm in high school dude . i 'm ill - equipped . 
i also have good teeth . no cavities . we finally got fluoridated water in dancing elk . 
i have no idea what kind of girl i am . 
once ! and she did n't die if you recall ! 
yeah well there 's this couple who 've been trying to have a baby for five years . 
no it 's not . paulie is virile by the way . he was very good in ... chair . 
the baby ? i do n't know anything about it yet . i only know it 's got fingernails allegedly . 
i 'm so sorry you guys . if it 's any consolation i have heartburn that 's like radiating down to my kneecaps and i have n't gone number two since wednesday . morning ! 
they say they 're going to pay my medical expenses and everything . i promise this will all be resolved in thirty - odd weeks and we can pretend it never happened . 
no no i 'm definitely not asking for anything . except maybe mercy . like it would be really great if nobody hit me . 
which maneuver sir ? the one in which i moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another or the one in which i cleared a sixty - four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes ? 
my dad used to be in the army but now he 's just your average hvac specialist . he and my mom got divorced when i was five . she lives on a havasu reservation in arizona ... 
i do n't know . it 's not ... seasoned yet . wait . huh . yeah there 's that pink plus sign again . god it 's unholy . 
jesus i did n't say it was . 
silencio ! i just drank my weight in sunny d. and i have to go pronto . 
i think the last one was defective . the plus sign looked more like a division sign . 
prom is for wenises anyway . once you 're old enough to go it 's not cool anymore . 
i 'm not jealous and i do n't care . i just know he does n't like katrina and i do n't think he should toy with her emotions like that . she seems so nice and all . 
yeah well bleek trusted me . we 're best friends . 
there 's no way in hell they 're having sex or even holding hands . 
bleeker told me katrina 's whole house reeks of soup ! 
katrina ? pfft no way . he does n't like katrina . it must be a pity date . 
eww he 's all beardy ! 
i was thinking a graphic designer mid - thirties and his cool asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass . but i 'm trying to not be too particular . 
there 's a guy in here who 's giving away a piano . free for the hauling ! we should put it in bleeker 's yard . 
the penny saver sucks . 
come on leah . i ca n't scope out wannabe parents in the penny saver ! that 's tacky . that 's like buying clothes at the pump n ' munch . 
there are ads ? for parents ? 
bleeker and i were going to go to gettysburg for spring break . 
i know . maybe they 'll canonize me for being so selfless . 
what does that even mean ? anyway i got to thinking on the way over . i was thinking maybe i could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing . you know like a woman with a bum ovary or something . or some nice lesbos . 
i 'm staying pregnant le . 
i could n't do it leah ! it smelled like a dentist in there . they had these really horrible magazines with like spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains like someone read them in the tub . and the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers and she told me about her boyfriend 's pie balls and su - chin kuah was there and she told me the baby had fingernails . fingernails ! 
it was magnificent man ! 
it 's extremely complicated and i 'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state . 
like a year ago in spanish class . 
nah it was a premeditated act . the sex i mean not getting pregnant . 
that is sick man . 
eh i 'll call them myself . but i do need your help with something very urgent . 
i know . women now i guess . the commercial says they help women now . 
that 's the kind of emotion i was looking for in the first take . 
unfortunately yes . 
i drank like ten tons of sunny delight . anyway yeah . i 'm pregnant . and you 're shockingly cavalier . 
it 's not a food baby . i took three pregnancy tests today . i am definitely up the spout . 
dude i 'm pregnant . 
no it 's morgan freeman . got any bones that need collecting ? 
i am a suicide risk . 
you think you 're special because you get to play picture pages up there ? 
well i 'm a nail technician and i think we both ought to stick to what we know . 
i said what - is - your - job - title missy ? 
what is your job title exactly ? 
they could be utterly negligent . maybe they 'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would . have you considered that ? 
wait what 's that supposed to mean ? 
what ? i 'm not made of stone . 
oh mac no ! he 's a sweet kid . you know it was n't his idea . 
oh god yeah . but i was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs . 
you 're not going to be a pop - pop . and juno 's not going to be a ma . somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from jesus in this garbage dump of a situation . i friggin ' hope . 
i think kids get bored and have intercourse . and i think junebug was a dummy about it . but we have to move on from here and help her figure it out . 
nails ? really ? 
shit .   hey can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already ? 
well honey doctors are sadists who like to play god and watch lesser people scream . 
it 's called a spinal block and you ca n't have it yet honey . the doctor said you 're not dilated enough . 
oh go fly a kite . 
yeah because you 're allergic to their saliva . i 've made a lot of sacrifices for you juno . and in a couple years you 're going to move out -- and i 'm getting weimaraners . 
i know enough . 
it does n't work that way kiddo . you do n't know squat about the dynamics of marriage . 
that was a mistake juno . mark is a married stranger . you overstepped a boundary . 
you could have sent it to them . why would you drive an hour out to east jesus nowhere ? 
a couple of hours ? why are you going up there in the first place ? 
where the hell have you been junebug ? 
first things first we have to get you healthy . you need prenatal vitamins . incidentally they 'll do incredible things for your nails so that 's a plus . oh and we need to schedule a doctor 's appointment . find out where you 're going to deliver . 
well you 're a brave young lady . you 're made of stronger stuff than i thought . you 're a little viking ! 
junebug that is a tough tough thing to do . probably tougher than you can understand right now . 
oh god ... 
well i was just asking . it seemed plausible . 
hon did you get expelled ? 
juno ? did you happen to barf in my urn ? mac you know that nice urn by the front door the one i got up in stillwater ? i found some weird blue shit i mean stuff gunk in there this morning . 
that was my first instinct too . or d.w.i. anything but this . and i 'm going to punch that bleeker kid in the weiner the next time i see him . 
did you see it coming when she sat us down here ? 
i 'm not ready to be a pop - pop . 
just tell it to me straight bren . do you think this is my fault ? her mother 's fault ? 
no i mean the father ! who 's the father juno ? 
what ? ! 
well of course . your old d - a - d ! you know i 'll always be there to love and support you no matter what kind of pickle you 're in . 
it 's not easy that 's for sure . now i may not have the best track record in the world but i have been with your stepmother for ten years now and i 'm proud to say that we 're very happy . 
tore up from the floor up ? 
well it 's kind of skanky . is n't that what you girls call it ? skanky ? skeevy ? 
are you having boy trouble ? i got ta be honest ; i do n't much approve of you dating in your condition 'cause ... well that 's kind of messed up . 
you mean like couples ? 
think you can narrow it down for me . 
you look a little morose honey . what 's eating you ? 
no but you know bren . she dreams big . 
bren took liberty bell to her tot ice skating class . 
hey big puffy version of junebug . where have you been ? 
excuse me ? 
she 's joking . junebug has a wonderful sense of humor which is just one of her many genetic gifts . 
i thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when . 
damn skippy you 're not ! you do n't even remember to give liberty bell her breathing meds . 
did you say you were thinking about adoption ? 
okay this is no laughing matter . 
paulie bleeker ? i did n't know he had it in him ! 
who is the kid ? 
you 're pregnant ? 
what have you done junebug ? did you hit someone with the previa ? 
do you need a large sum of money ? legal counsel ? 
so juno how did your maneuver go last night ? 
you should have seen this octopus furnace . i had to get out my hazmat suit just to get up in there ... 
what do you make with that ? 
so . what 's that thing ? 
yes . heating and air conditioning . 
you do n't say . 
hello . thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home . 
mark ? why is juno crying ? 
juno ? what 's going on ? 
wow ! it 's magical . 
oh my god -- it moved ! i felt it ! 
um ... juno can i -- can i touch it ? 
oh okay . so ... how are you feeling ? 
just you know shopping with my girlfriends . 
right . well juno your parents must be wondering where you are . you might want to head home . 
no no i do n't think that juno . it 's just that we went through a situation before where it did n't work out . 
um i think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it 's not you know set in stone . 
oh it 's just some stuff i picked up . for you know the baby . babies need a lot of things . i want everything to be just right . 
yeah . yeah it kind of does . 
oh my god ... 
is the baby okay ? 
then what 's going on ? 
juno ! god you startled me . what are you doing here ? what 's wrong ? 
oh really ? 
so then you really think you 're going to go ahead with this ? 
sure . the powder room down here is being re - tiled but you can use the master bath upstairs . go up then turn left and on your right ... 
well shall we start looking over the paperwork ? gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents . 
i think pregnancy is beautiful . 
the tough part 's almost over for you . i mean my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest . 
oh that 's marvelous . so you 're almost into your second trimester then ? 
i 'll get drinks . what would everyone like ? i 've got pellegrino vitamin water ... 
you found us in the penny saver ? 
can i take your coats ? 
hi ! i 'm vanessa . you must be juno and mr. macguff . i 'm vanessa . 
you do n't make anything . it 's for exercising . 
a pilates machine ? 
well i was born to be a mother . some of us are . 
well have n't you ever felt like you were born to do something ? 
oh no . thank you . come on in . 
are n't you the cool guy ? 
a hotel ? 
have you found a place to stay ? 
we 're actually finally doing this ? 
no it 's fine . thanks for making the call i guess . 
like what ? be a rock star ? 
what would be a good time for you ? 
she answered our prayers . 
why do n't we let juno go home and we can discuss this later on okay ? 
of course we 're ready . we 've taken all the classes . the nursery . the books -- 
what are you referring to ? 
what did you do ? 
juno what 's the matter ? 
can you see it ? 
that wall is going to need something . maybe we could put our first family picture there . 
and i disagree . 
i think i 'm leaning toward custard in this light . i do n't know . i should paint a small area ... 
well i wanted to pick something gender - neutral for now . once we get the baby god willing we can create a more decisive palette . 
what do you think ? custard or cheesecake ? 
you guys are playing music ? 
i want to be a mommy so badly ! 
you 're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us . 
are you looking for any other compensation ? 
okay juno i 'm really convinced . 
are you jealous ? i thought you said you did n't care what he did . 
i would n't be so sure about that . he did it with you . he 's a man now . 
oh it totally does . i was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like lipton landing . but you know boys have endured worse things for nookie . 
he asked her . i heard they were going to benihana then the prom then to vijay 's parents ' cabin . 
did you hear bleek is going to prom with katrina de voort ? 
keith 's hot . 
what did you have in mind a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest ? 
you 're not listening to me . 
yeah but it sucks for free . 
well maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads . i see them all the time in the penny saver . 
maybe they 'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to cabo san lucas for spring break . 
but then you 'll get huge . your chest is going to milktate . and you have to tell everyone you 're pregnant . 
keep your voice down dude my mom 's around here somewhere . she does n't know we 're sexually active . 
oh gruesome . i wonder if the baby 's claws could scratch your vag on the way out ? 
what are you doing here dumbass ? i thought i was supposed to pick you up at four . 
so what was it like humping bleeker 's bony bod ? 
aha ! you love him . 
when did you decide you were going to do bleeker ? 
so you were bored ? is that how this blessed miracle came to be ? 
heavy lifting can only help you at this point . 
want me to call for you ? i called for becky last year . 
well are you going to go to havenbrooke or women now for the abortion ? you need a note from your parents for havenbrooke . 
oh my god ! oh shit ! phuket thailand ! 
is this for real ? like for real for real ? 
how did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests ? 
maybe it 's just a food baby . did you have a big lunch ? 
only the one in my pants . 
is this juno ? 
yo - yo - yiggity - yo . 
there ai n't nothing we could do . once early sets his mind on somethin' well that s the end of that . 
... there ai n't nothin' can kill 'em . they can live for two even three hundred years . 
... you can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they 're doin' even better than before . 
you lose ! 
me neither . how 'bout you carrie ? 
early did n't kill nobody he would n't do that . i do n't know why you 're saying those things . you ai n't my friend . 
that 's not true ! 
... that 's not true . 
an ' resistin ' arrest ... at least that 's what the police said . 
carryin ' a gun . 
my momma 's a beautician . guess that 's where i get it from . she would n't hear of my moving in with early ... on account of his just getting out of jail and all . ai n't seen her in nearly a year now . i wish she 'd call me just once . 
you think early 's bad to me do n't you ?

early can we stop there ... just for a little while . 
how many times you gon na tell me that ? 
geez they look kinda weird . 
did you settle things with mr. diebold ? 
what if they 're dangerous ? 
do n't be long now dinner 's 'bout ready . 
you know ... i read once ... ai n't nothin' on that big old moon ' cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind . 
what 'll we do out there ? 
i guess that 'd explain why there 's so many stupid people around here . 
i feel kind of like the wizard of oz you know when she gets the red shoes . 
early you are so sweet . 
... i would n't lie to you adele . . . i saw him kill that man . 
the police are after him he 's a murderer ! 
jeez ... adele ! 
... anything else ? 
what 's early been in jail for ? 
adele ... are you serious ? 
you should n't let him do that to you ... 
hold still . 
that 's me . 
took 'em all . 
it 's a portfolio of my work . 
i 'm cool . 
you know i can fix that haircut for you if you want ? 
how 'd you meet early ? 
i have n't ... i 'm a fast learner . 
he whips you ? 
so you do n't do any of those things . 
you dropped this . 
... yeah sure . 
not really . 
... yeah . 
karma ...   you know if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you . 
... thank you . 
... pardon ? 
what about you ? 
what are you going to do ? 
i tried talking to her at the mine . it did n't work . 
what the fuck is wrong with you brian ! ? if you 'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes ... you 'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer . he is ... for real ! 
brian get him out of the car . next gas station either he leaves or i do ! 
brian i want him out of our car ! 
wrong ! i was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to california ... there 's a big difference . 
i ca n't believe i agreed to do this . 
i 'm scared . a week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun . this afternoon you 're out there wielding it around like clyde fucking barrow for christ 's sake ! what 's with you ? 
i 'm finished . 
what 's that ? 
look again ! 
maybe he was n't allowed to leave ! geezus brian ! 
yeah and you should 've seen how terrified she was that he 'd find out . he beats her . 
you sure been acting like you were ...   ... out whoopin ' it up a drankin ' and ever ' thang . 
i do n't want to talk about it . 
you try i 'm gon na pretend they 're with somebody else . 
up yours . 
feel sorry for him ? obviously you did n't get a whiff of that sock ? 
you mean because i object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while i 'm eating i 'm prejudiced ? 
hey i got some great stuff ... it 's okay . 
jesus ... they 've probably got five bucks between them . turn around . 
funny very funny . 
i still think we should have met them first . 
what did he sound like on the phone ? 
it 's about fucking time kessler ! i 'd just about given up on you . 
a book on the warehouse murders ? 
this mean your finally going to finish your thesis ? 
so how 's it going ? 
thanks . what are you doing ? 
just like that . load up the lincoln ... point it west ... stop when we hit the fucking ocean . 
no we ca n't . we can never leave once you start talking about tenure ... and vacation pay ... and parking privileges and ... oh shit ! let 's just go to california now right now before it 's too late . 
then you can write anywhere . let 's get out of here while we still can . 
i thought you wanted to be a writer . 
mmm ... i love it when you talk like that . 
it was definitely the high point of the evening . 
the party ? 
who do i have to blow to get out of here ? 
thank god ! 
oh i do n't know ... i think that once i dye my hair blonde buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan ... i could be veggin ' out with the best of 'em ...   like fer shurr ! 
... soon as he finishes his thesis . 
... apprehensive . let 's not forget these are the people who banned the mapplethorpe show . anyway california 's loaded with galleries . 
not yet . 
... i know i 'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face . 
you sick twisted fuck ! you do n't know shit about me .

yeah . 'cause they fucking shoot you in the eye the face the ear . 
hell yeah they do n't know . 
boom ! ! ! boom ! ! ! 
right . you 're like it 's just this instinct . it 's like this animal instinct is taking over you . it 's like ... 
hell yeah . i love . i love sex . 
you did n't ? 
did you bleed ? 
you are being ripped open . 
the pain . the fucking pain ! 
you still mad at him ? 
telly says was up . 
i made her get tested with me because i did n't want to go alone . 
and the other person i just fucked which was a mistake . but i went to the clinic last week with jennie . 
and i know that one of them fucked like two other girls who were both virgins so i knew he was safe . 
i 've known the past of all the people i 've fucked without a condom . like i know one of the people got tested and was negative . 
yeah i get bored . 
yeah . fifteen minutes to a half an hour . hard and deep . 
yeah it 's the biggest disappointment ! 
and we were blasted and he must have been dumb horney . and he just pulled me over to the bed . and they were in the room like getting dressed like getting ready to go to go to disco 
yeah . it depends . cause like this one time with eric when we got blasted at his house . and smash j and dj flipper was there ... 
it 's really slow . it 's slow boring . 
it 's like ... 
making love is like . 
right . you know it 's not like ... you know there 's a difference between sex making love and fucking ! 
you can drink like there 's no tomorrow but you still ca n't get that sperm between the teeth out . it 's so disgusting . 
no no no . you ca n't get that taste out of your mouth . until you eat something . 
it was ... it was . 
to come ? 
he was like sucking my tits . he was fucking fingering me . but that shit was nice and hard . 
and we were like underneath the sheets . we were going at it like crazy . oh my god that shit was so good ! it was like hard ... 
it 's very monotonous . 
it 's grandmother style . 
that shit is nothin' . i remember i had just turned 14 . with this fuckin ' asshole who was like 18 . i do n't even remember his name . i think it was john or jake or something . i remember he had a brother named lentil because i would always joke and call him lentil bean . this was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit . 
casper where is he ? 
casper where 's telly . 
no fidget i ... 
what is it ? 
who are they ? 
fine fidget . what 's all this ? 
telly is at steven 's ? 
i do n't feel so well . have you seen telly anywhere ? 
but i only had sex with telly . 
i tested positive ? 
your a real philosopher . 
what if you ca n't make yourself happy ? what if everything falls apart ? 
yeah i guess so . 
everything is wrong . 
yeah well it 's been a bad day . 
no . i 'm ok . thanks . 
i 'm fucking serious . where 's telly ? 
it 's jennie . just tell me if telly is there . 
hello paul . is telly inside ? 
no . i just got ta go find him . 
i got ta find him . 
i got ta go . i got ta find telly . 
i only did it once and ... 
that 's it . i 'm gon na have to tell my little brother i 'm gon na die . i ca n't make him his lunches anymore . 
good luck . 
yeah . and you 're not getting anything out of it . 
and sometimes it takes a long time and you 're fucking gagging . 
i hate sucking dick ! 
mine are like my neck and my chest . 
like where are your erogenous zones ? 
yep yep . but he has to know what he 's doing and where he 's going . because they can like touch you for hours and they wo n't ever know . 
foreplay . foreplay . 
no i did n't bleed . 
i did n't bleed . 
i know . 
and you feel like you 're being ripped open inside . 
of course . how am i gon na forgive him after what he did ? ! 
i knew he would n't want to speak to me . that dick . 
who benny 's little sister ? 
do you know where he went ? 
what happened ? 
yeah . have you seen telly around ? 
just a lot of crazy shit . 
do you care about me ? 
i do n't want you to hurt me . 
but i 'm scared telly . 
how do you know ? 
i 'm nervous . 
i like you too . 
come on . 
uh huh . 
i do n't know . i 'm supposed to go to nasa tonight . 
i do n't know . i guess it 's cause my sister nicki had a baby when she was like 15 . she was really young so my mom is like very protective over me . 
no . i ca n't . my mom wo n't let me have boyfriends . 
i thought you had a girlfriend . 
you were ? 
at the block party ? 
you have ? 
ooh . you 're gon na give me goose bumps . 
hold on . 
right now ? 
i was just getting ready to take a bath . 
you could n't find your dick in a wind storm ! 
it is n't him .   frank you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this . 
remember eventually revenge is carefully ...   have you tired juxtaposing the words ? 
he was with me ? 
it does n't make sense because we do n't understand it . 
now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious . 
what do you mean stand out ? 
a few people . 
maybe you 're reaching a bit ?   i think sanderson should be in on this . there 's a reason why the killer 's calling him . 
sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today ? 
he 's one of the best chess players in the world .   who better to play a game with ? 
you were n't mad at him for picking up the phone ? 
i think your mother knows that now . why do n't you put the knife down .   put it down david . 
i know but this is n't going to bring her back . 
yes i do .   i found your file .   i know what happened . 
this is n't going to help david . you 're mother 's dead .   you ca n't undo it . 
yeah -- that 's what we 've always thought -- but what if he was n't ?   what if i had nothing to do with the reason he came here ? 
come here . 
why did he ? 
he already did once . 
i 'm just nervous .   sorry . 
how come the police never had a record of sanderson before .   this does n't come out of nowhere there has to be a history . 
i just ca n't believe it . 
fuck off ! 
do n't patronize me !   you sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and did n't warn me ! 
--the same type as the girl who got killed .   jesus alan the guy could be a psychopath . 
you could have been honest with me for starters .   we work together .   i have to be able to trust you . 
oh well we would n't want to disturb your guests would we ? 
you 're damn right !   i 'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer ! 
nice meeting you . 
how do you know that ?   did he say something ? 
of course . 
that 's only because you do n't know where to go .   you like hiking ?   fishing ?   sailing ?   what do you like ? 
so are you having a good time on the island ? 
is your dad here ? 
i 'm kathy . 
you must be erica . 
i 've got a room at the institute i use when i stay late . 
no .   he was wearing a mask ... but i saw the cut on his wrist .   it was peter . 
you do n't have a shred of evidence ! 
this stinks !   you want to know what i think ?   i think there have been five murders and you 've got shit to go on . you need to blame someone and he 's the easiest choice . 
and what if he 's wrong .   if you were one hundred percent sure it was peter you would 've arrested him .   if it is someone else then he 's going to kill again tonight and you 're sitting here ignoring the message . 
what does that mean ? 
what are you saying ?   that i 'm seeing what i want to see ?   that i 'm protecting a murderer ?   what ? 
about a quarter to one . 
as large as castles . 
each of those grids represents almost a square mile . 
he moves around a lot .   why ? 
i thought that homesearchers was a dead end ? 
well i think you have to play to his ego .   he thinks he 's superior .   the more secure he feels the more chances he 'll take . 
peter 's right captain .   he 's got to be forced into making a mistake . 
i know that .   i 've seen the photo 's . 
his home would be ... mount olympus . 
i would think it 's some type of clue as to where he 's going to kill next ? 
yes .   why disguise your voice if no one knows it ? 
that would indicate he 's playing out a fantasy .   power - control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them .   once they become a reality though they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it .   but in all the research i 've read on serial killers i 've never heard of one moving so fast . it 's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around . 
well the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim . 
but we heard him . 
--edmonds .   i know .   you lost to karpov in ' 82 did n't you ? 
i see you 're still having problems with your openings . 
i 'm busy right now . 
what do you think he did ? 
only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to sanderson for some case you 're working on .   what 'd he do ? 
i 'm a psychologist frank ... not a psychic .   what 's this all about anyway ? 
well what ?   i told you this was a stupid idea .   you ca n't learn anything from someone in a few minutes . 
what are they please ? 
could you please do me a big favor ?   in the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess .   could you look and tell me what they are ? 
sara this is doctor sheppard .   i called you earlier about a book . 
thank you .   i 'm at 639 - 7393 . 
i just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future . 
there 's a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you .   you made a difference . 
you beat him . 
yeah .   i 'll be there later . 
you 're going to be late for your match . 
of course not . 
he did n't tell you either . 
no he did n't . 
it could be anything . 
maybe you 're afraid of what it says . 
why not ? 
of course it is n't .   it 's always difficult when someone you love dies . but you ca n't feel responsible because she had a car accident . 
then help me to understand .   i want to understand . 
you 're wife died .   you ca n't feel responsible for that . 
that 's still no excuse .   you treat everything like a game . 
i want someone i can get close to . i do n't know if that 's possible with you . 
i 'm not looking for an apology peter . 
because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid ? 
but what does he mean by a fierce magazine ?   violent ? 
for emphasis ? 
peter you have to admit-- 
i tried again and got through . 
they 're not delivering .   i 'm going to go pick up the pizza . 
the line was busy .   i 'll try again . 
would you settle for pepperoni ? 
what do you want on it ? 
i 'm hungry . 
you can turn everything around so easily .   this is not just another game is it ? 
i said i did n't plan on getting involved . 
you 've got to face the things you feel . 
then show me who you are . 
does anyone ? 
nobody could attack you .   you set your life up like one of your chessboards . you 're impregnable -- but at the same time you 've become trapped behind your own defenses .   you 're cut off from everyone around you . 
i 'm just trying to get to know you peter . 
yes you are .   you 're playing word games . 
have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games . 
and you ? 
it must 've been very hard on erica ? 
i 'm sorry . 
i dunno .   where 's erica mother ? 
no .   you were talking about chess . 
you always want to talk about me .   what about you ? 
i 'm sure you are . 
can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it ? 
because i think he 's wrong . 
you know andy thinks you 're doing this . 
how could you ?   unless you were there . 
how the hell can i relax after seeing what i just saw . 
no -- i 'm not involved .   and i plan on keeping it that way . 
because i work with them . 
of course . 
you have to win every point do n't you ? 
you 're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did . 
that 's not fair ! 
i think it 's best if we do n't ask too many personal questions -- i want to keep things on a professional level . 
let 's change the subject . 
of course . 
that 's true -- but the emotion is still there .   they just learn to control it . 
how can you look at it so clinically ? 
this is n't a game . 
another kind of game ? 
does what 's going on bother you at all ? or are you just wearing your game face ? 
you sound like my mother . 
i do n't think i could . 
what if she is n't ?   where are your priorities ?   you have to think between someone 's life and a chess game ?   the girl he killed last night was only twenty one years old !   he dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage ! 
she could be dead after the game . 
but you 're the key .   the one he wants to play the game with . 
we need your help . 
they could n't break the riddle . 
nothing .   i just came in for a steam . 
well i think i 've had enough . 
well i hope you remember that tomorrow when you play krikorian . 
do you always open quickly ? 
i thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess . 
are you disappointed that i wo n't answer you ? 
that 's a very personal question . 
--but you enjoy being the stronger one ? you like the control . 
sounds very violent . 
it seems like such a complicated game . 
i 've always wanted to learn how to play chess .   i do n't have the patience for it .   when did you start playing ? 
are you one of the players ? 
are you with the tournament ? 
because i love them but they drive me crazy .   you know how parents are ? 
i love this hotel .   i stay here every time i visit my parents . 
is this your first time here ? 
it 's alright . 
that 's a better one . 
that way . i can feel the cold . 
come quickly colwyn . i can see the eyes of the beast . 
i knew you would come . 
all directions are the same here . 
i do n't know how . 
all the passages are guarded . 
colwyn . colwyn .   i love you colwyn . 
i know it . 
i do n't know . it 's a maze of tunnels . i ca n't see out . 
in a great fortress in the mountains . wait . something 's happening . 
no . they watch me closely but they have n't harmed me . 
about what ? 
i ca n't . 
i do n't have to look around . i 've found the husband i want . you can kiss me now . 
there . now you look like someone i might want to marry . 
i do n't trust you to wash behind your ears . 
well then you can go up to the parapet and i 'll hand the buckets up to you . 
we 're almost married . 
take off your clothes . i 'm going to scrub you down . 
i have no intention of getting used to it . 
you < u > might</u > be handsome . i ca n't tell through all that grime . besides you reek of sweat and horses . 
you 're really not bad looking . almost handsome . 
mine was worse : i dreamt you picked your nose in public . 
me too . 
you do n't understand . i 'm just so < u > relieved</u > . i was < u > sure</u > you 'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy . 
i 'm sorry . i could n't help it . 
he will come for me . 
he will not ! 
it 's a lie ! 
i do not want your worlds or your slaves . 
i do not want your power . it is hideous . 
there is sand enough for only one life . go now save the other . 
you can not stop time . go now before it runs out . 
it will not help . 
tomorrow the fortress of krull will rise with the sun in the valley of reeds . but the knowledge is of no use to you . no man has ever escaped the web . and soon the creature will come for you even here . 
you lie ! 
why must you know ? 
of what ? 
power you have given me . what can my power give you ? 
those are reflections .   < u > this</u > is my face ! 
do not try your trickery on me ! 
i killed him when he was born .   this place is my punishment . 
you had left me ! i kept silent out of rage . 
you had a son . 
she bore you many children ? 
she was not as beautiful . 
but you would not stay with me . 
i was beautiful then . 
it is fifty years since i heard that name . 
who speaks that name ! 
... i heard he said ... that 's all ... thanks . 
... office 2702 . 
give me his name i will mail him . 
he forgot his money ...   my mother 's got a pub behind the corner and he forgot his money about 100$. 
what 's that man 's name ? 
... i do n't know ... it 's true he touches me . i love him . 
no ... not yet .   he 's very shy ... and very sensitive . 
... what ? 
no ... i ca n't ... i got tired . i want to live my way . 
asshole . but she wo n't miss anything that . you 'll see . 
you say it just to calm me ! 
no no ! i do n't want to go !   i do n't want ! 
no ! i do n't want to leave you ! ! 
how shall we get out now leon ? 
i do n't know ... five minutes . 
why did you unleash the pipe i do n't know ? 
i do n't know ... getting far away the two of us for example ...   and forgetting all this ... 
maybe it 's the time to do something is n't it ? 
what do you do with the money you earn ? 
may i ask you a personal question ? 
... that 's awful .   i hope you killed that asshole ? 
then ? you did n't give a shit about her father did n't you ?   you met anyway ? 
why ? did you have too many and you fear it may shock me ?   i wo n't get shocked . i 'm used to this !   my father was a true pig . he fucked the bitch i 'd as mother all around the apartment . whenever a door was closed you could be sure they were making sex behind it !   and my sister if you did n't sleep with her you 're building 's exception ! 
well ... 1 ... 2 ... 10 ... 100 ... 1000 ? how many approximately ? 
how many girlfriends did you have ? 
... do n't you like me ? 
... do n't you drink ? 
of course ! i 'm fine !   i put on your beautiful dress i slightly made up ...   i tried to get beautiful !   do n't you like it ? 
well ... i proposed them to play roulette ...   like we played ...   ... and i lost . 
i love you so much leon . 
i do n't grow up any more . i just get older . 
you 've just to love me and i 'll be the happiest woman around . 
huh really ? what ? come on i 'm waiting ! 
there are just two things i 'm interested in : love and death .   for the moment i have none of the two ! 
risky business is n't it ? 
yeah ... i 'm just good for left - overs ! 
yeah ... there 's a lot on tv . 
a little ... 
friends ? you 're crazy !   in my building before they just cared drugs all day and you could n't get one or they just cared video games and you could n't get one no more . 
that was n't bullshit i said we love each other . 
... i 'd like knowing what he 's listening to ... 
it 's cool departing this way ... warm ... music ... 
piddle . she smiles and looks for the bathroom . she finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath walkman on . she withholds a shout and gets against the wall without moving . she does n't dare passing before the open door again to join leon . in the living room leon still thinks . 
what shall we do ? 
ok ok ! excuse me ! how old were you when you had your first contract ? 
... ok .   i love you anyway . 
when i say i love you . 
... you do n't believe me do n't you ? 
of course so kiss me quickly or they 'll notice us . 
... i 'm going to kiss you . 
and ... may i kiss you like in the movies may this be an exception ? 
if you knew leon ... !   i killed one thousand in my head ...   and this never disturbed my sleep . 
well ... then may you rent me your gear for the day ? 
... this is what i do n't like you see : you do n't refrain me but at the same time i ca n't get out ! 
i hate you because you depart without kissing me . that 's all . 
for musicals ?   that 's part of the job ! 
may i go to the cinema ? 
why do n't you take me with you ? ... i 'm ready now .   you said i learn very quickly . 
... because i feel it . 
it 's strange being in love ... it 's the first time for me ... 
i killed him ... and cut him and ate all of him ... i left nothing for you ! 
you were scared were n't you ? 
there the guy ... how did you do that without even touching him ? without noise . it 's like you put him away ... how did you do it ? 
it 's incredible ! how did you do it ? 
yes yes ... 
the yellow and pink . 
yeah but i did n't get him i got his case and now he 's behind the tree . what can i do ? 
the fat man down there on the bench . 
who 'll i aim at ? 
wow ! it 's brilliant ! 
oh really ?   but can you miss the car ? 
what if you ca n't approach the car or he changes car ? 
what for example ? 
how can you say it ? 
huh ... 500 meters ? 
ok i 'm fine . 
i have no fear . 
excuse me mister ... i 'm looking for mister rubens ' apartment but it 's dark out here and i got lost ... 
it 's not me it 's dark here ... and i ca n't find the switch . 
... i got lost mister . 
good morning mister ... it 's danielle ! 
... no ... he 's my lover ... 
yeah but he 's not exactly my father ... 
... composer . 
i 'm used to it .   not everyone likes music . 
yeah . i put a rag on the strings to lessen noise . 
i 'm sick with practicing that 's it ... 
can i sit on the stairways now ? 
... and how much is it ? 
huh ? why ? 
why am i such an authority ? 
what is it ? 
i wo n't let you die . 
listen to me very carefully because i do n't want you to misunderstand me ... the walk is over uncle maurice .   done . finished .   you 've made it to california it was a miracle now let 's try to save your life . 
i do n't think you realize how serious this is uncle . 
maybe later . 
uncle the way i was told if that police car did n't happen down that road you would be dead right now . that guy denny had jumped bail in another state he 's dangerous ... they 'll be other dennys if you do n't plan . 
if you ca n't redo these six hundred miles when you 're rested and ready how are you possible going to walk another two thousand - five hundred miles in your present condition ? 
why did you take the back roads here ?   they 're not safe .   you 'd know that if you 'd planned . 
if you really want to do this ... plan it out .   rest up .   train for it .   build up your body .   plan every stop along the way .   how much money ?   time ?   really do it properly .   this is all so -- by the seat of your pants . 
what if you do n't make it ? 
she was being symbolic .   what if she asked you to fly to the moon ? 
it 's impossible . 
uncle maurice -- i spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here ... i have a rented car outside just listen to me .   come back with me now and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we 'll plan a car trip across the country -- gerald and i will come along -- 
i do n't accept that . 
and your store ?   what about your new store ?   what about all your dreams ? 
uncle maurice you 're wearing sneakers ? 
thank you . 
a couple days to a few months if untreated . 
i think my uncle is suffering from a condition called mania which is linked with depression .   it is a time when an individual will act over - confident and will act out impractical grandiose plans . sometimes these plans can be dangerous . 
sergeant i 'm a psychologist and i know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems ... my uncle lost his wife and it devastated him . 
put out a p.b.s .... or whatever it 's called . 
i have a 4.0 . 
that 's right . 
enrique 's gay . i 'm sure of it . 
i believe you ! do n't worry . 
i know ! you helped me go from a six to a four ! 
whatever it is -- it could save you . 
who could better understand than me ? 
he means well . he 's really brilliant and all . 
are you okay ? you look so sad ... and so orange . 
sort of . 
i 'm a delta gamma and i 'm a huge fan of yours ! 
you however had time to hide the gun did n't you chutney ? after you shot your father ? 
and if you in fact heard the gunshot then brooke windham would n't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs . which would mean that you would 've had to have found mrs. windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible . is n't that right ? 
that 's right . because is n't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty - four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de - activating the ammonium thiglycolate ? 
chutney why is it that tracy marcinko 's curls were ruined when she got hosed down ? 
you know a girl in my sorority tracy marcinko got a perm once . even though we all told her not to . curls really were n't the right look for her --   she did n't have your bone structure . 
how many would you say ? 
yes your honor . had you ever gotten a perm before miss windham ? 
where you got in the shower . 
miss windham can you tell us what you 'd been doing earlier in the day ? 
but you did n't hear the shot because you were in the shower . 
so at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower your father was shot ? 
did you hear a shot fired ? 
but mrs. windham did n't have a gun ? 
and when you came downstairs what happened ? 
okay -- ms. windham when you uh arrived back at the house ? was your father there ? 
tell him paulette . 
due to the fact that you retained the residence ms. bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately . 
i 'm elle woods . ms. bonafante 's attorney . 
dewey newcomb ? 
yes i am . 
so everything you just said -- 
you 're hitting on me ? 
not really . i know how competitive it all is -- 
i 'm sorry but -- 
thank you . 
is everything okay ? 
thank you ! 
he 's gay -- he is n't brooke 's lover ! he 's making it up . whoever killed heyworth is paying him off . 
i promised her i 'd keep it secret . i ca n't break the bonds of sisterhood ! 
yes . but i ca n't tell you what it is . 
all i know is -- it 's not brooke . 
forget it . i 've already spent too many hours crying over you . 
for what ? breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man ? 
we spend a beautiful night together and then i never hear from you again ? 
why did n't you call me ? 
he chose them already ? 
what 's going on ? 
what 's the point of staying ? all people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs . no one 's ever going to take me seriously . the people at law school do n't warner does n't -- i do n't even think my parents take me seriously . they wanted me to grow up and become a victoria 's secret model who marries a rock star . now for the first time it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living . but i was kidding myself -- donovan did n't see me as a lawyer . he saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else . it turns out i am a joke . 
i 'm so happy for you ! 
trust me . you 've got the equipment you just need to read the manual . 
i am . and i 'm looking at a beautiful fabulous sexy woman . 
have you ever considered asking him if he 'd like a cold beverage ? or perhaps a neck massage ? 
so this is the only interaction you two have ever had ? 
i feel so bad for her . i mean she 's in jail ! and she 's innocent . but i 'm the only one who believes her . donovan totally thinks she 's guilty . 
look at him . he 's still scratching his head . 
yes you are . go -- you can do this . 
you ready ? 
i could n't help it ! it was the most fun i 've had since i 've been in law school . not only was i good enough for warner -- i was better than him . he has to see serious i am now . even donovan was impressed and he 's a total hard - ass . 
definitely ! i love him ! 
she could use some mascara and some serious highlights but she 's not completely unfortunate - looking . 
she 's from connecticut . she belongs to his stupid country club . 
that 's terrible ! 
what 'd you do ? 
well what am i supposed to do ? he 's engaged ! she 's got the family six- carat on her bony unpolished finger . 
you ca n't even imagine . 
delta . gamma . 
i 'm her sister . 
uh -- family . 
i 'm here to see brooke windham . 
you 're pawning the rock ? ! 
yes he is . 
yes you are . 
you 're kidding ! 
i know . he has it sent out . 
really ? thanks . 
it 's not my alibi to tell -- 
too bad you and i are the only ones . 
although mr. huntington makes an excellent point i have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life ? 
oh god was this like an rsvp thing ? 
you know her ? 
not yet . 
i ca n't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important . i 'll make it up to you after finals okay ? i -- promise . i really want to do a good job . 
i will ... 
no way -- 
what ? ! 
power yoga ? 
why yes margot i do . once again we joined hope in the search for her identity . as you know she 's been brainwashed by the evil stefano -- 
your scrunchie ? 
i have the highest gpa in delta gamma ! 
once warner sees me as a serious law student he 'll want me back . it 's a completely brilliant plan ! 
thank you . i love you too . 
i do n't know ! everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --   serious ! 
what if -- you know -- it 's not the night ? 
well i do n't want to look like i know what 's coming ... 
too demure ? 
you think ? 
you guys are so sweet ! 
is he the only one ? 
then forget it . besides i have an early class tomorrow . 
are you asking me on a date ? 
oh my god ! 
going back to la . maybe i can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the swedish bikini team . no more navy blue suits . no more panty- hose . no more trying to be something i 'm not . 
law school was a mistake . getting this internship was a mistake . 
i 'm quitting . 
gay men know designers . straight men do n't . 
he 's gay ! enrique is gay ! 
for a butt - head ? yes . 
fine . sorry i brought it up . 
well you should -- if you look good you feel good and if you feel good you project joy into the world . 
the bags under your eyes . you 're an attractive man but you need to take better care of yourself . 
exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty - year - old man can take ? 
if she were a true blonde she would 've left the cheating bastard . blondes do n't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it . 
that is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination ! 
it would be a full - service law firm by and for blondes providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas . i mean think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model . 
i never trust a woman who 's not blonde . except for my friend serena but that 's only because she 's a blonde at heart . that 's the whole reason i 'm starting the blonde legal defense fund . 
did you see the icky black color of her hair ? 
you 're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment ? she 's ly - ing . 
she 's not ! 
mrs. windham vandermark ? 
no she ca n't move for an hour . 
maybe not to your face ... 
because people are n't always what they seem to be and you refuse to see that . have a little faith . you might be surprised . 
you 're kind of being a butt - head right now . 
but maybe it 's not what you think . 
a ) he 's an old man with a really big penis . b ) she never told me i was fat . and c ) victoria principal sells on that network . 
aside from that . 
explain to me why you 're so anti- brooke . 
my money 's on the angry daughter or the ex - wife . 
do n't ask . 
thanks again for your help ! 
wow . i 'm glad i met you . 
donovan royalton and levinson . 
did she do that to you too ? 
and if you do n't know the answer they just kick you out ? 
do they just -- put you on the spot like that ? like all the time ? 
i ca n't believe you 're a laker girl ! 
you guys -- i ca n't . we 're in the middle of a trial . 
what 're you doing here ? ! 
i miss you guys ! the people here are so vile ! hardly anyone even talks to me unless it 's to say something that 's not nice . law school sucks ! 
calvin klein 's spring line is atrocious . do n't you agree ? 
girls -- i 'm going to harvard ! 
i do n't know ! i do n't know anything any more !   i just need to be by myself . 
i just do n't understand what went wrong -- 
thank you serena but i do n't think it 'll do any good . 
no -- it 's just -- not me . 
but i 'm not positive it 's gon na happen tonight -- 
of course i do ! 
maybe she found him like that . 
she could make you drop three pounds in one class . she 's completely gifted ! 
she was a delta gamma ! not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me . but i used to take her class at the la sports club . she 's amazing ! 
and engraved ... gives it that extra little something does n't it ?   see you tomorrow ! 
i do . 
i do n't know -- 
i did ? 
i changed my mind . i 'd pick the dangerous one . 
i 'd rather have a client who 's innocent . 
i guess it 'll have to ... 
you know -- mixers formals beach trips . 
wait -- my social events schedule is missing . 
has warner huntington checked in yet ? 
huh . imagine that . looks like i am . 
in court . on opposing sides . 
thanks for the backup . 
i gave her my word warner . 
thank you . 
but what ? we took the same lsat we take the same classes -- 
am i on glue or did i not get into the same law school you did warner ? 
tell me about it . i ca n't imagine doing all this and donovan 's internship next year . 
i feel like we 've barely spent any time together since we got here . 
thank you . having fun ? 
i 'm sorry i just hallucinated . 
do anything exciting ? 
fine . except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my civ pro professor . but no biggie . you 're here now .   how was your summer ? 
oops ! time for class . meet me after ? on the benches ? 
what like it 's that hard ? 
harvard . law school . 
no silly . i go here . 
i 'm seriously in love with you -- is n't that enough ? 
just because i 'm not a vanderbilt all of a sudden i 'm white trash ? i grew up in bel air warner ! across the street from aaron spelling ! i think most people would agree that 's way better than a vanderbilt -- 
so you 're breaking up with me because you 're afraid your family wo n't like me ?   everybody likes me ! 
how can it be the right thing if we 're not together ? 
then what ? my boobs are too big ? 
you 're breaking up with me because i 'm too -- blonde ? 
you 're breaking up with me ? !   i thought you were proposing . 
i completely agree . 
and i fully support that . 
of course . 
i 'm fully amenable to that discussion . 
so are you ! 
his dead body with a bullet in it . 
uh yeah because the bitch shot him . 
i got out of the shower walked downstairs saw her standing over my father and called the police . 
she 's younger than i am . did she tell you that ? how would you feel if your father married someone younger than you ? 
because they got wet . 
two a year since i was twelve . you do the math . 
i got up went to starbucks went to the gym got a perm and came home . 
yes . i was washing my hair . 
i guess . 
no . i was in the shower . 
no she 'd stashed it by then . 
i saw brooke standing over his body drenched in his blood . 
not that i saw . but like i said i went straight upstairs to take a shower . 
you ca n't go home ! 
of course i can believe it . you 're going to make a great lawyer . 
how 'd it go at the trial ? 
and after they set his nose he came back for his truck and i offered to drive for him since he was still on pain - killers and we spent the whole afternoon together ! he was unconscious for part of it but it was really fun ! 
good one . 
what 's the point ?   look at me . 
that 's because men are big fat retards who do n't -- oh my god ... 
which must be a nice vacation for his balls ... 
god that felt great ! 
you showed up warner in class ? you 're supposed to be showing up sarah . 
is she ? 
is she as pretty as you ? 
so what 's this sarah got that you do n't ? three tits ? 
what could i do ?   he 's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures . i 'm a middle- aged high - school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass . happens every day . at least to women like me . 
i did n't even get to go to his birthday party . 
cried a lot and gained twenty pounds . dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby rufus . i got jackcrap . 
after you went to all that trouble ? 
hello ! you 're like a lawyer . 
speaking of which can you please put on some party clothes ? you look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a k- mart . 
oh how sweet ! you made friends with a nerdy girl . 
keep june first open -- you 're one of my bridesmaids . and give warner our love . 
josh proposed ! 
picking out my wedding dress ! 
it 's elle !   guess what i 'm doing right this second ? 
my lucky scrunchie . it helped me pass spanish . 
here . you 're gon na need this . 
but is n't it kind of hard to get into law school ? 
honey stop ! you have to leave this room -- it 's been a week . 
we still love you . sisters forever ! 
serious ? ! who the hell does he think he is ? you 're the most popular month on the usc calendar ! 
why else would he be taking you to the ivy ? you 've been dating for a year -- it 's not like he 's trying to impress you . 
i think you should go with red . it 's the color of confidence . 
why else would she have flown in from newport ? it 's not like she 'd fed ex a six carat diamond . 
can someone please tell rick that he is not the only sigma chi with a big penis ? 
pull up next to him ! 
yeah luckily . 
why ? ! 
let 's all go ! road trip ! 
you 're right . phew ! 
oh god . what if josh does n't think i 'm serious enough ? 
it 's not a theta -- 
to be strong and free ... that is all i desire . 
yes .   i feel that too .   weakness is what is ugly . 
now i want to live forever .   i 've never felt so strong or happy . 
it 's odd ... when i first found myself ... changing ... i was sick with loathing and disgust .   i thought i was so ugly i wanted to die ... 
and i with you ... i never dreamed life held such pleasures ... 
might we watch too ? 
it sounded like it came from the courtyard . 
what was that ?   did you hear that ? 
you 're a beast ! 
i do n't expect you 'd understand . 
do as you wish with my body you 'll never possess my soul ! 
i see ... 
what will become of me then ? 
and then ? 
oh yes ... 
what do you want from me ? 
do n't please ... i 'll do what you desire ... 
no more ... please ... 
kill me ... i want ... so nice ... 
jack ... oh jack ... help me ... 
do it now ! 
damn you ! 
i 'd soon die . 
why have you brought me here ? 
do you feed on mice and rats ? 
like some vile toadstool . 
then why hide behind a mask ?   you are ashamed ! 
and you ... are you not also afraid ? 
you ... you 're a beast ! 
god protect me . 
you lie !   you wish to humiliate me as if the form i 'm forced to bear were not punishment enough ! 
grotesque ... monstrous ... 
but i 'm hideous ! 
you are cruel !   your heartless jesting worse than torture !   how can you speak of love when you see what i am ! 
your words sting more sharply than your whip . 
what do you want with me ? 
oona ?   do you suppose it 's a faerie ? 
i ca n't see a thing . 
pinching ?   where ? 
biting you ? 
what 's the matter ? 
and i love you my husband . 
you wear your weeds as well as golden armor jack .   like a true prince ... a champion ! 
nay dearest jack ... you are to be my husband .   i want none other . 
oh no dearest jack ... i meant every word . 
seemed like weeks and weeks .   such a terrible dream ... i could never tell you ... 
sweet jack .   i 'm so sorry you found me asleep .   do n't know what came over me . 
oh !   green jack !   what a dream i 've had ... proper nightmare . 
and i ... love you ... 
in the dark ... where i join him ... 
that 's why he goes masked during the day ... 
sunlight ... it destroys him . 
no ... it 's not you he 's afraid of it 's ... light ... 
you 've freed me jack ... 
i was bewitched ... it 's better this way ... 
only what 's right ... 
jack ... forgive me ... 
do you wish it jack ?   wish you this our wedding band ? 
then perchance you 'll me . 
be it fit for your wife green jack ? 
let it .   have n't you a cozy bower we might hide in ? 
oh la ... 
nay jack i 'm but wary of your intentions . 
if i were your bride would the kissing ever stop ... ?   do you wish to marry me jack ? 
a maid must beware of flattery ... methinks you want to kiss me . 
jack ... green jack you must n't flatter me so . 
i do n't want to be reminded of what happened . 
i do n't want it on me . 
oh yes and the mare with him . 
it happened so fast .   he was hurt and ran away . 
my own father ... 
i did n't know ... i did n't ...   it was so lovely ... he was in my lap like ... like a baby ... and ... i ... 
my father and the baron . 
i do n't know .   they 've hurt the unicorn . 
where are you going ? 
i 've no fear of failure .   your implications are most unbecoming . 
he 'll not flee if i show myself ? 
oh jack might n't i touch one ?   it would thrill me so . 
such grace ... and their smell ; it 's ambrosia . 
i am a princess .   you have no right to order me about . 
how much longer ? 
the napkin will keep .   i 'd rather not be alone . 
do n't leave me now .   i fear the unicorn wo n't show himself without you . 
i 've lost my napkin .   it was all elf - work and lace ... i must have dropped it when you startled me so . 
oh dear . 
what shall we do ? 
i detest serpents . 
a gentleman would offer water . 
let 's rest a minute .   i 'm so thirsty . 
a promise is a sacred oath . 
oh fie .   what about the unicorn ? 
the baron is a frightful man .   they say he 's an ogre .   he wears a mask so none may see his face . 
it 's my father gone a - hunting .   the baron couer de noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport . 
but you did ... you did ! 
you promised ! 
if you like . 
oh jack you are a wild man to use me so . 
what a fine meal you 'd make be the rest of you sweet as your tongue . 
you 'll visit again ? 
do n't be sad jack not with me here to give you cheer . 
far as you 're concerned she 's dead believe it or not . 
dead dead dead . 
she 's dead ! 
as fair as me ? 
is she fair this princess ? 
princess ?   i know of no princess . 
ask away sweet man . 
come sit beside me sweet boy and i 'll draw you a map . 
follow the raven in her flight follow old black wing to the edge of night ... 
you 'll need the fastest steed alive for couer de noir 's castle rests at the very edge of the earth .   only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of achilles will protect you from his fury . 
that would be the baron 's way . there 'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished . 
couer de noir !   a demon if the devil ever made one . 
why then there thou hast .   we be lucky worse has not befallen us . 
i like well your conceit jack .   tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world . 
the moon is too round of face methinks . 
think me fair do you jack ? 
come closer then jack that i might give you proper thanks . 
well spoke boy .   you have discerning taste for one so young ... just who might you be ? 
what 's this now ? 
true north ...   straight up that pass through the net . 
is this a may day pageant ?   are you all off on a lark ... ?   the raven passed this way hours ago ! 
you beware jack !   you and your porridge - pot heart ! 
i would build a wall around me with such stone so the likes of you might never enter . 
what care i for the human heart ! such a soft spiritless thing it is . i prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves ; fierce and free and keen as steel ! 
why should i feel such pain ?   should be the other way round ... i could vex you ... make you dance your life away ... 
you ... you ... you mortal you ! 
what shape i take matters not .   long you for another ?   i 'll give you your heart 's desire . 
a faerie 's love makes anything possible . 
pray you be sweet as your words dear jack . 
and sweet ? 
tell me i 'm fair as you did the hag . 
jest with me then . 
then why do you speak sweeter words to jenny greenteeth ? 
and am i not fair ? 
do i not please you jack ? 
fie !   do n't speak of charms .   i should charm you for being so dull- witted . 
only that ? 
i 'm partial to oaks as are all faerie folk .   may n't i come visit sometime ? 
then tis not for chastity ? methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night . 
such a sad world be there no unicorns to brighten it . 
no need for bells jack .   i 'll nay enchant ye . 
were i a mortal girl jack methinks i 'd be in love with you . 
courage jack . 
it 's so beautiful . 
he 's here .   check the bathroom . 
i guess it depends on what you give up on . 
since seventh grade . 
i woke up this morning at three and could n't fall back asleep .   everyday i think i see more of sam than i 've seen in years . 
oh honey .   there 's not much to do there . i mean it 's all work . 
you can go back to bed ... or lois might let you go swimming . 
i thought i might stop by . 
will he talk to me ? 
he 's not the type to worry . 
well he does n't need to worry . 
he 's at work while i 'm here . 
why is that ? 
you 're so nice to let sam use your shower . 
i better get the kids home . 
do n't move ! 
are you going to kiss me ? 
i could die . 
back .   neck .   back . 
' i 'll be in the bedroom . ' 
no goodbye .   no fuck you .   no ' are you in love with george ? ' 
peter left me yesterday . 
i kept thinking about it what you said ... i hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me . 
is your back still killing you ? 
i need to know . 
if i were n't married ? 
i 'm married . 
it sounded like a pick - up line . 
you 've never said that before . 
that thing about i was the most you know beautiful person you had ever known .   what was that ? 
when i picked you up from the train station ... what you said . 
nothing is going on with us is it ? 
i thought we were helping . 
do you know alyssa thinks something is up with us ?   she 's giving me crap about being away from peter and now you 're trying to do the same thing !   what no one seems to realize is that peter is n't there !   he 's not there !   and when he is he is n't !   so if you do n't want me here or you do n't want my kids here just tell me george .   i 'll stop coming .   but it wo n't be because of peter .   it 'll be because you asked me to stop .   say what you need to say because i 'm not leaving until i hear it . 
what is it with this ?   they would n't spend less time with peter if they lived here !   he has no time ! 
i know they 're not much help but they love coming here george . 
no .   why ?   i like to be with sam . 
let 's see if you 've gotten any better . 
i smiled at him . 
this was my very first slow dance . 
do you need help ? 
or wound .   let them keep their eyes and fingers . 
i kind of said that maybe they could do something .   help .   i 'm sorry .   they really wanted to come .   i really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me .   i do n't think they 'll be too much trouble . 
where 's sam ? 
do you need anything ?   i 'll go to the pharmacy .   i have some demerol at home . 
i thought you 'd be up with the sun . 
you 're not well . 
i 've been wrong a lot in my life . 
the antibiotics were n't working .   it 's what i believe george . 
my tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him . 
that was n't a dream .   that was sam . 
it was perfect george .   amazing .   it was so real . 
i dreamed about your house last night . 
i 'm fine .   nothing .   i 'll drop by your lunch tomorrow . 
we have it on video !   was that when ?   my parents were down for his sixth birthday ! i remember that . 
do you remember ? 
what have you been before today ? 
sam 's favorite . 
the first and the last . 
i was here six years .   and i only hated two . 
i used to live here . 
it makes me sad . 
well for later then . 
i did say he could go . 
no .   i was going to let you do that . 
last time you were gone for a week ! 
i drove over and you were gone . 
what was i supposed to do ?   when you did n't show up saturday i tried to call . your phone is n't working . 
i 'm married . 
no you do n't .   trust me . 
forget it really .   i 'll survive . 
one of you would end up dead . 
thank you for at least sounding sincere . 
you and sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer ? 
he does n't want to spend the weekends with you anymore . 
friday ... god i hate the thought of him home all day . 
look i was n't serious about you taking sam so you do n't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it . 
where will you live ? 
how many years did i live with your beams and boards ?   first in the garage then in the living room .   we 're going to do it robin .   next year .   next year .   salvaged floorboards from a house in pasadena . doors from a church in new hampshire ... 
you 've been saying that for twenty years . while we were dating you said it . 
why call me ? 
why would they tow your truck ? 
but you ca n't call me while you think ? 
what did you do with your dog ? 
where have you been for a week ? ! 
you did n't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat ? ! 
you 're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion ! 
i called everyone everywhere !   you just vanished !   you could be dead ! 
because he put the lock on !   do you think i told him he could have a nose ring ? ! why do you ask me everything you should ask him ! ?   i do n't know anything anymore ! 
he never answers . 
what are you doing ? 
where he always is . 
lock the door behind you . 
did sam call to tell you he would n't be over this weekend ? 
ring the bell before you try the door . 
i feel in love with george again . 
i hardly recognize you with a beard . 
sam took them to a movie . 
that 's the problem . 
despite you . 
you never really trusted me . 
what are you doing home ? 
i know . 
sam is working at something for the first time in his life .   once in a while he even talks to me .   i want to be around for that . 
we have n't been away together for three years .   what difference does a few months make ? 
i ca n't go right now . 
i 've been helping for the last few days . weeks .   sam 's working .   i told you sam was working .   i mean he really is . 
i 'm helping george build his house . 
after the kids are back in school . 
i 'd love to drive through new england in the fall . 
the biggest waste of time since television . 
to shave your chest ? 
what would you be if you asked adam and ryan to run in now and hug you ? 
it would worry me . 
do you think it 's odd your kids do n't hug you ? 
i 'll make you something . 
we 've eaten . 
a man he respects . 
i do n't have a clue anymore .   i wish you 'd talk to him .   he needs a man . 
i read the letter .   you read the will . he wants you to keep it .   to live in it some day . 
you could keep it and rent it out ? 
you 're sure about this ? 
i do n't know what i 'm doing . 
can you stay for dinner ? 
i did n't go in your room . 
in the bedroom . 
go tell your father we 're eating . 
nothing r okay ? 
would you stop being ridiculous ?   your father wants sam home as much as i do . 
adam that 's not true ! 
i brought a few of my own . 
ryan would you rather swim or work ? 
not all day .   i 'll be home after lunch . 
i just thought it would be nice . 
what did you say ? 
he 'll be gone for his birthday . 
run downstairs and give your dad a hug . 
who are all these people ? 
i 'd be more comfortable if you had n't slept with josh .   and george would be more comfortable if he were n't dying . 
i 'm going to bed . 
uh ... using josh like that . 
i 'm supposed to be mad at you but i 'm not . 
what are you doing up so early ? 
you 'd better call and cancel . 
and why was the alarm on ? 
what 's wrong ? 
i do n't know ...   more like when i kissed sam . 
it 's not what i was expecting . 
my mother would die . 
did you feel anything ? 
i want you to try something with me okay ? 
i need to ask you something mr. nelson . 
he would n't use around me .   i do n't like any of it . 
he 's not gay .   i found out purely by accident believe me . 
i 'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer i 've decided . 
what 's that ? 
is that legal ? 
why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage ? 
marilyn manson ... and i guess he 's into guys .   i hate nose rings .   and the blue eye shadow thing really is n't working . 
he seems lonely . 
sorry i got you into trouble . 
where are you ? ! 
he asked where you were !   he wants you with him . 
not if what he left me was real . 
if he tricked me into loving him is what i meant . 
are you afraid of heights ? 
okay but then we 'll just be friends . okay ? 
no i don't ... no .   i thought we were just friends . 
i thought i was helping you . 
not really . 
i was wondering . 
josh said ... 
are you sure you 're totally into guys ? 
does everything have to have a point ? 
it means i 'm gon na shampoo my hair and stay out of your way . 
why are you so uptight ? 
we 're not gon na do anything . 
i 'm coming in . 
i 've seen lots of people .   it 's not a big thing for me . 
this is serious !   i do n't have my license .   he was my ride . 
he asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars . 
his parents took his car .   they 're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer . 
i 'm okay . 
josh and i are going to south coast . wanna ride ?   maybe see a movie ? 
turn over . 
i wanted him to marry her . 
your dad dated my mom after her divorce . 
do you remember me from when you lived here ? 
i 'll get your back . 
come over to my house whenever you want . i 'll tell my mom . 
you look better without make - up . 
where 's your dad ? 
you should stay . 
well if you do n't go i guess i 'll see you . 
your dad 's really gon na build his house ? 
where to ? 
what are you doing here ? 
he wo n't leave my room . 
if my kids and my wife were always at an ex - husband 's house i 'd worry . 
i guess i 'd just be jealous if i were him . 
just i mean well you 're here every single day . 
he 's got a standing invitation . 
he wants the entire roof taken off and lowered . 
funny how he 's the architect and you 're just a loud mouth cop . 
i would n't want you as a friend . 
i mean but did you both go camping on weekends ?   listen to music ?   masturbate together ?   talk on the phone ? 
are you guys ' friends ? 
it could have been a squirt gun . 
ipo 's caused the rat population on this street . 
this is such a street of whiners . 
i would totally love to go there . but i hear it 's really hard to get in . 
all these good people have totally been led astray . 
i 'll call her later . 
try four and a half . at first i totally did n't like him . 
oh . my . god . i ca n't believe you 're here . welcome . can i just tell you i am so excited right now . 
you 're already there ... 
it would be so okay . 
i 'm not a hundred percent on that . god said when the time comes you 'll know what to do . 
stronger yes . smarter definitely . but you have something he does n't have . 
yeah you do ... 
she 's so nice . 
we can see what 's going on anywhere on earth . look . 
it was a long time ago at some heaven and hell mixer . 
angels do n't get any older son . 
well she was about six - three only spoke portuguese and had really long grey hair . 
unh - huh . which would make you half angel . 
try an angel . 
a mountain goat ? that 's really sweet . 
okay can i just ask you something ? what do you know about your mom ? 
maybe try the opposite of that . 
i love you . 
where 'd a sweet southern boy learn to fight like that ? 
do n't do it . 
we 're going to jersey ? 
can we go fly over central park ? 
okay i do . get back up here . 
look just because you 're floating does n't mean i 'm gon na forget about you giving me the finger . 
am i supposed to not be freaked out right now ? because i am . 
why would you be floating ? 
what are you doing ? 
are you dead ? 
what were you thinking coming here ? 
nicky ? oh my god . stay right there . 
what was that ? 
you know what 's nice about you ? you just seem happy being yourself . you do n't try to act cool . 
basically yeah . 
sometimes sure . 
my perfume ? 
parsons school of design . i knew growing up i was n't much to look at so i put my energy into making things that are pretty . 
i 'd love to have a dog . but i go to school full time . it would n't be fair to the dog . 
you have a dog ? what kind ? 
this town is really going to hell lately .   so what part of the city do you live in ? 
it 's not that cold . here let me wrap it . 
if you want to . 
that 's alright . i already ate lunch . i actually would n't mind getting a gelati . 
well i 'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out . 
i 'm sorry . it 's really tough when your parents get older . 
my dad 's an optometrist . 
why are you laughing ? 
i 'm sorry . i just assumed . your accent maybe . where are you from ? 
that 's okay . i get messed with all the time and when i saw him doing that to you i just lost it . i hate when people take advantage of tourists . it ruins it for the rest of us . 
... and he was hunting the first one this one . was n't he ? was n't he ? this one was running the other one was hunting him ... 
holly . holly ! please ... the other sandman . remember the one who came after -- 
no holly -- wait ! he 's running . tell them the rest ! 
when do you go up ? 
why are n't you in nursery ? 
where do you live mary ? 
what 's your name ? 
is it inside the city ? 
what does that water do ? 
beloved husband ... 
and sanctuary ? 
i want to be alive and with you that 's all i want . 
you want to go back to kill is that it ? ! now you 'll want to kill your own ! ! ! kill sandmen ! ! ! killing 's all you ever ... ! ! ! 
things wo n't change ... you know that ! we can live here together logan ... have a life as long as his ... together ! 
you 're lying ! you 'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything ! you 'll be killed the moment you 're seen ! 
to what ? 
he asked if we would bury him when his time comes . 
you 're wrong ! ! it has to be ! ! it just has to be ! ! 
there has to be ! i know it exists ! it has to ! ! 
there 's a sanctuary ... there is ! 
he had a mother and father -- and he knew them . 
look at his face ... and his hair ...   is that what it is to grow old ? 
yes do you think that 's why he looks so sad ? 
then the answer 's yes ... 
... but i still have the choice ... ? 
you can have any woman in the city . what do you really want ? 
what does it mean ? 
thirty thousand years did n't last very long did they ? 
maybe we 're the first ones to get through ...   maybe sanctuary is near now ... another protected place . it could n't be outside . 
do you think he was telling the truth ? 
do n't ever let go . 
do you think everything 's going to turn to ice ? 
it 's getting dark and cold . i 'm tired . 
do n't ! 
i hate outside ! i hate it ! 
and yours . 
what 's that ? 
for us . 
because you felt like a runner did n't you . 
i wanted to ...   ... and you ... what made you kill sandmen ? 
you 're really one of us now are n't you ? 
i do n't know what 's going to happen to us logan but --   are you glad you did n't kill him ? 
i 'm afraid . 
ycch .   to kill things and then eat them . it must have been a savage world . 
what do you suppose this was ... ? 
how do we know this is the right way ? 
will you take me with you ? 
they 're watching us now . they 'll let us in when they 're sure . 
exactly four steps now . let me lead you .   now to the right . it 's narrow here you 'll have to get behind me . 
we 'll convince them . 
they wo n't listen . 
they wo n't believe us . 
he 's good is n't he ? 
yes .   i do n't know what else to do -- with him following us .   why do you keep running from your -- 
no . not that either . 
i -- i ca n't . 
yes but they wo n't know that ... or care . they 're hunting you logan . maybe me too now ... 
logan i do n't know where sanctuary is . but if i take you to them they 'll kill you . 
i 'm ashamed . i was bringing you to be killed . 
muscle ? i do n't know that one . 
but what is this -- why ? 
i do n't remember exactly ... except i was a green .   what would you like to relive logan ? 
i have . 
i 'm only telling you what i 've heard ...   have n't you ever wondered what your seed - mother was like ... ? 
some people say children need human mothering . 
maybe they 're angry because they 're grown in meccano - breeders . 
i 'd rather be with you . 
you 're not going are you ? 
we 're coming to arcade .   shall we relive together ? 
of course -- 
i wish i knew what you think i know . 
i wish i could help you . 
what 're you going to do ? 
what do you need ? 
i never heard of a sandman running ... ever ... 
please ? what friends ? 
i do n't .. 
and then you killed him right ? 
where did you get that ? 
how can i ? 
i know what everyone knows . try like hell for renewal . you have the same chance everyone else has . 
about running dying what ? 
why tell me ? 
why show me ? 
i do n't believe you . there has to be more . 
you can have any woman in the city . what do you really want ? 
then it 's still no . 
thanks ... but i have the choice . 
i 'm the most beautiful woman you 've ever seen i suppose ? 
here i am .   shall i come in ? 
you could have called me yourself . 
six . i go red next year . 
i did n't say that i would run ... i just ... 
i suppose . but what if you want to live ? 
why is it wrong to run ? 
i 'm afraid to tell you . 
not about that . 
how a sandman lives . 
i changed my mind . 
i thought i had to do something . 
nobody . i felt sad ... i put myself on the circuit . 
is n't it right ? is n't that what you do ? kill . 
he was killed . 
a friend of mine went on carousel tonight . now he 's gone . 
nothing . i felt sad i put myself on the circuit . it was a mistake . 
no .   just no . 
please ... no . 
come with us . 
we 'll remember . but that 's a long time off ... 
at least it 's over ... 
what 's that ? 
what people ? 
what belongs to the people ? 
i do n't know . 
are you sure ? 
and ... and how were you grown ? inside your mother ? 
but there are so many of them . do you know each one separately . 
i do n't know if i want to stay here . i do n't feel safe .

i thought you were getting me a drink ? 
but that does n't solve the problem . who is doing this ? and why ? 
i do n't know . maybe a hotel . 
why would anyone do something like this ? 
on the tape ! there was something else on the tape . 
what was that ? ! ! ! 
what the hell is going on ? !

it 's me ... 
okay baby .

i want more . 
where 's your phone ? i have to call another taxi . 
okay then i 'll take you to dinner . 
how would you like to take me to dinner ? 
i was here yesterday . 
fuck you ! ! fuck you ! ! 
you're sorry ! ! 
what 's the bitch 's name ? ! 
you fuck me whenever you want ... you do n't call ... tell me who she is . 
you 've been fucking somebody else have n't you ? 
i did n't know you cared . 
i was ? 
where 'd you come from ? 
why do n't you like me ? 
i do n't know . 
what do you want ? 
no ... i really do n't want to talk about it . 
i do n't want to talk about it ... 
it was weird ... 
you really do n't remember ? 
you still care about me ? 
you were acting like a different person . 
you sure were n't acting like the pete dayton i 've always known . 
last time i saw you . 
what do you mean ? ... you 've been acting strange lately ... like the other night . 
what 's happening to you ? what happened to your face ? 
why have n't you called me ? 
you want some company ? 
what are you guys doin' ? 
i missed you . 
i 've thought about it for years .   i knew you 'd come . and i knew if you did - you 'd never leave .   am i forgiven for sending for you ? 
would you like to wring my little neck ? 
why mother ? 
i was just going to . 
struggling why ? 
goodness no . from what you tell me about it it certainly does n't sound very attractive . 
you see it 's not a dream . 
i 'm sure of it . just as i 'm sure there 's a wish for shangri - la in everyone 's heart . i have never seen the outside world . but i understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy . yet i just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security where there 's beauty and comfort where they would n't have to be mean and greedy . oh i just wish the whole world might come to this valley . 
perhaps because you 've always been a part of shangri - la without knowing it . 
i 'm so glad . 
i 'm sorry . i thought i was to be the light . but why do i confuse you ? am i so strange ? 
what is ? 
i 'm thirty . 
yes i know . 
well i was almost born here . it took place in that wild country beyond the pass . my father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year . when chang found us only father and i were alive . but he was too weak to climb the pass . he died on the way . i was brought up here by father perrault himself . 
i 'll help you . to begin with you 'd like to know what i 'm doing here . whether i was born here . 
i really only brought you here to show you my pigeons ! 
as a matter of fact all i saw was a little boy whistling in the dark . 
oh i know . it was full of this and full of that . but you were accomplishing nothing . you were going nowhere and you knew it . 
i saw a man whose life was empty . 
that was easy . i read your books . 
yes . hold this pigeon . 
oh you mean my pigeons . 
my name 's sondra . 
yeah ... ? 
what are you doing ? 
are you sure you do n't ? 
the only thing i could think of would be ... you 'd have to get rid of the queen . 
out of focus ? 
what the hell does that mean ? 
what do we do ? 
it would 've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks . 
man hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all . 
it 's the most amazing insect nest i 've ever seen .   and i 'll tell you one thing it sure as hell ai n't the andean mollatoosa . 
i swear to god that was not here two days ago ... 
well first of all it 's entomologist . 
i do n't think so .    i mean him he could be a scientist maybe .   but you ...   exterminator i 'd understand .   but entopolgist ?   no way . 
it 's hard to find .   it 's an old civil war cemetery .   nobody ever goes there .   so ... what is it you say you do ? 
once-- just once-- i thought i 'd made the discovery of a lifetime ... 
do have any idea what i just said ? 
with exclusionary frecto - inhibitors ? 
yeah right .   even i can barely read all my work . 
so ... how 'd you hear about this ? 
or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare .   i really like that .   let the other girls have the guys like you . chiseled jaw perfect nose quirky dimples .   i find you all so boring . 
actually they disgust me .   but that 's what i love about them .   like a car wrack you know how you should n't look but you always pull over and watch real close or even pretend you 're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures ? 
really nice wheels by the way . 
seriously .   i 'm not going any further until you tell who you are . 
the what ? 
hmnn ... wall it 's funny cause usually i 'm not all that attracted to stupid guys but-- 
come again ? 
i mean i dunno .   i 've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability .   but never like this . 
yeah .   nov i know it looks normal but watch this . 
scientific american ?   really ? 
i 'm sorry john but you have to run again . 
she 's not alive but she did n't die . 
she grew up . 
the drowning woman .   anne ... but it was too late .   her little girl was already gone . 
ca n't you see ?   she just wanted her little girl back . 
i am going back .   i see myself there . 
i always wondered what the world would be like .   but now that i 've seen it i do n't need to see any more .   it 's all right .   once i 'm in the tank i wo n't remember any of this . 
the other two will die without me . 
i have to go back . 
where are we going ? 
but you still have a choice .   the others never had a chance to see their future .   you did . 
please i want to go back ... 
what is it ? 
anderton leave . 
he wo n't . 
no .   follow him . 
do it .   right here .   on the ground . 
drop some money . 
can you see the balloon man ? 
take it . 
they 're inside . 
is it now ? 
is it now ? 
can you see ? 
john ?   what is it ? 
i know ... i do too ... 
about who ? 
think john .   why would they set you up ? 
found ?   where ? 
then who was he ? 
then how did he -- 
oh god what did you do ? 
anne lively ... but i never said she drowned . 
no .   i do n't think you do .   the other day when he came to the cottage he talked about a lot of things but danny witwer the man he was supposed to have just killed ?   he did n't mention him .   he did n't say his name even once . 
no .   that 's what everyone thinks .   john shot a man dead in baltimore six months before . 
lamar do you know the reason why john came here to work with you ? 
he also said crow was a fake . 
anne lively .   john was talking about her right before they took him . 
i thought you were retiring ? 
you look great . 
no it is n't lamar .   there was nothing anyone could do . 
i have n't seen him in two years . 
to what ?   trap him ? 
i left him because every time i looked at him i saw my son .   every time i got close to him i smelled my little boy .   that 's why i left him .   and now you can leave . 
he shot a hole in the damn ceiling . so what ?   you lose your son let 's see how well you handle it . 
the fbi found something that belonged to my son .   a sandal ... anyway john was upset . he ... he ... 
it was n't a suicide attempt .   i regret ever saying that . 
it was nobody 's fault . 
since right after we lost our son . 
that was our apartment . 
no but then i do n't talk to john that much anymore . 
i do n't have any sugar either . 
we used to every summer . 
i do n't have any cream .   sorry . 
thanks .   you take anything in your coffee ? 
i know who you are . 
the female . 
it 's always in the more gifted of the three . 
sometimes in order to see the light you have to risk the dark . 
actually i think you 'll have to run out but yes that 's what you have to do . 
if ... you have one . 
inside the precog who predicted it .   all you have to do is download it . 
the safest place of all . 
i said the record is destroyed . the original report exists for all time .   i designed the system so that whenever a report occurred it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared . 
you should n't .   you should n't trust anyone ... certainly not the attorney general who wants it all for himself .   not the young federal agent who wants your job .   not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he 's created .   do n't trust anyone .   just find the minority report . 
hold that thought . 
but you will bring it down if you kill leo crow .   why that will be the most spectacular public display of how precrime ... did n't work . 
do you ?   really ? 
the system would collapse . 
yes of course he knew but at the time he felt -- we both felt their existence was ... an insignificant variable . 
i used to joke with lamar that we were the mother and father of precrime .   well in my experience parents often see their children as they want them to be not as they are . 
i 'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might just might have an alternate future . 
obviously for precrime to function there ca n't be any suggestion of fallibility .   after all what good is a justice system that instills doubt ?   it may be reasonable but it 's still doubt . 
because these minority reports are destroyed the instant they occur . 
most of the time all three precognitives will see an event in the same way .   but once in a while one of them will see things differently than the other two . 
i ca n't help you .   no one can .   the precogs are never wrong . 
how can you avoid a man you 've never met ? 
and yet a chain of events has started .   a chain that will lead inexorably to his death . 
so many of them ... despite what we did for them .   or maybe because of what we did to them .   it does n't matter .   it 's a perfect system now is n't it ? 
back then he was still a da and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom . you have to understand these people were the dregs of society . but once they saw their children ... he decided he would do whatever he could for them .   he 's that way you know paternal about certain things .   precrime .   the precogs . you . 
it began as play .   a guessing game like you play with any toddler except these children always guessed right .   and then the nightmares started . they were all different but all the same .   they were all about murder .   and the murders were all happening . 
you think the three in the tank come from a test tube ?   they 're merely the ones who survived . 
the innocents we now use to stop the guilty . 
i 'm not .   i was trying to heal them not turn them into ... something else . 
if the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention then yes i invented precrime . 
and how would i know that ? 
just what is it you think i can do for you ? 
you have three minutes to tell me what you 're doing here before i feed you to a few of my more predacious plants . 
the vine -- the baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall ... 
yes i 'm afraid that would be from the doll 's eye . 
something wrong ? 
i want you to take her with you . 
take her . 
do n't you get it ? i do n't want to leave . this is who i am . 
goodbye bobby . 
i never promised you anything . 
do n't get my hopes up . if i quit what then ? i ca n't go through this again . 
yeah well max offers a lot of things . and i got news for you . he 's not the sweet old man you think he is . 
with what ? 
look at the bills . i ca n't . i 'm not gon na put my daughter through what i went through . 
listen to me bobby . this is my job . it puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay . 
shhh . he 'll hear you . 
ho 's a good guy -- 
maybe if you did n't go rambo every time i did a lapdance you 'd still be doing it yourself . meantime i got ta feed my little girl . 
yeah ? you sure ? 
leave me alone . i have n't touched anything in months . 
forget ricky . you should be glad max got you driving for me . 
you should n't . he likes you . 
fine . you want to help ricky talk to maxie yourself . 
the only way he 'll go with ricky is if you 're in too . 
i 'm not gon na mention ricky to him . 
bullshit . these are classy customers . you ca n't show up all fucked up with a fila running suit on . 
she 's downstairs with ruth . get ready . 
will you cut it out ! get ready we 're already late . 
oh please . 
they requested her . it was her gig . max put me on as a favor . 
bobby this is a plumb gig . it 's a bunch of young agents and it 's at a restaurant . it 's gon na be easy and we 'll make a lot of money . 
oh my god . what happened ? 
the easy kind . they 're young and rich and well mannered . 
easy night . bachelor party . can we give wendy a ride ? 
where were you ? 
i just put them to bed . can we come to the meeting tomorrow ? 
dear heart where are you ? 
malcolm they keep calling threatening us . i 'm going crazy when is this going to stop ? 
stop calling us . leave us alone . leave us alone . i 'll kill you . i 'll kill you . 
dear heart i love you . 
get some sleep . 
open your eyes you can face death 24 hours a day ; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind . if you wo n't do that for yourself do it for us . 
we need you too ! 
dear heart you have to help me . i 'm raising our kids practically by myself while you 're running all over the world . you do n't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home ? 
will they ? are you sure ? are you sure or are you blind ? 
what do we have malcolm . a broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs . we do n't even own our own home . what about our children ? what about me ? you do n't even own life insurance . 
a long time ago . you 've repaid them many times over . ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture . 
do you know what bembry is doing ? you 're so blind everyone can see this but you ! ! ! 
to bembry ? is bembry your friend ? 
we 'll get to that too but this is n't just talk any more . 
the talk is everywhere ! 
we 've never had a fight . not a real one . but we 're going to have one right now if you do n't talk about it . 
i 'm not made of glass . 
because you 're in trouble . 
the simplest thing in the world : i want to have a lot of babies with you . dear heart i love you . 
i never told you but when i first saw you on the podium cleaning your glasses i felt sorry for you . nobody as young as you should be that serious . but i do n't think that anymore . 
you 're with me even when you 're away . 
hush your mouth . 
just hold me . 
yes . did you eat ? 
yes i did . did you hear my answer ? 
i know . 
being a good muslim a good nurse and a good wife . 
and dogged when i set my mind to something . 
there 's a few things you do n't know about women brother malcolm . they 're possessive and vain . 
but brother bembry says i 'm tall enough for a tall man . 
if it 's just idle i wo n't answer it . 
why do you ask ? 
you have enough worries of your own . 
i can handle it . 
oh ? purely scientific interest i 'm sure . 
there 's nothing to talk about . 
how do you like it ? 
you 've been on your feet for days . and did n't even finish your salad . 
could we sit down someplace ? 
i see your point . 
considering today 's standards of animal raising and curing meats i do n't fully understand the restriction on pork . 
that you have n't time for either marriage or eating -- 
shall i tell my sisters that we oppose marriage ? 
if you want to tell me . 
she ate . 
you got that right . 
i could do it . remember the day you wanted the pencil ? i know why . and i saw that car again . i wrote the license number in my notebook . except i missed the last number . 
i 'm going to keep people safe someday . just like you . 
there 's no such thing as tough creasy . just trained and untrained . 
you should break all my fingers creasy then tape them back together . i wo n't be able to play the piano but i could still swim . 
frank . frankie . 
you think too much ? 
my mom drinks too ... why do people drink creasy ? 
i know because i go in your room and check the bottles . 
you do n't drink like you used to . 
could i ask you a question ? 
i 'm a prisoner in them . until the gunshot sets me free . 
why today ? and why 'd she have to go with him ? 
what 's so important in los angeles ? 
i 'm tough creasy . i 'm tough as you . 
the gunshot holds no fear . 
are you afraid of me ? 
i 'm not afraid you creasy . 
it 's no wonder you 're late . why did n't she just come with you ? 
where 's my mother ? 
you were never late before i was worried . 
you 're late . 
did you used to ? 
do you have a girlfriend creasy ? 
good things happen too creasy .   like meeting me . 
i do n't understand . 
what did you do in asia ? is that where you met the man with cigarettes ? 
so how come you know so much about those countries ? 
[ yeah . can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand ? ] 
it must be difficult having lots of wives . 
but the emperor of china had 1000 of them ! how can that be ? 
it was in a book at school . concubine . 
does n't matter . i always finish second . 
it 's not too bad . will it take a long time before it 's better ? our big swim meet is in three weeks . interschools . i was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle . 
i 'm too old for him . do n't tell my friends . 
the night you arrived mom asked you if you had a family and you lied did n't you ? 
my ankle . 
it hurts . 
they can stay for two weeks . i do n't care . 
it 's better to be free right ? 
how do you think he got out ? 
maybe . did you hear him ? 
calling for emilio 's macaw . i thought i heard him . 
once i get in the water but not starting off . by the time i catch up it 's too late . 
i go to school do n't i ? 
i 'm not crying . 
so you were unhappy ? 
but why not ? 
not at all ? 
did you like school creasy ? 
we 're taking a different way home . 
there were 24 kidnappings in mexico city in the last six days . four a day . what do you think about that mr. creasy ? 
being black is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in mexico ? 
someone gave him more money than we could . 
are you going to quit ? my last bodyguard quit . 
potential ? i do n't understand . 
why not ? 
you can drive and talk at the same time ca n't you ? 
i know . but which state ? 
where are you from creasy ? 
in between you can take mom shopping and to lunch . does that sound alright mr. creasy ? 
my last bodyguard . he drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon . 
that 's ' bird . ' emilio forgot to take him with when he left . 
frank only responds to commands in german . he was trained in frankfurt . my dad loves the idea of having a dog around but hates the fact he lives inside . 
frank does n't take to most people . do you speak german ? 
do you like dogs mr. creasy ? 
you 're going to miss mexican halloween . the day of the dead . 
bye mom . 
i think he 's been sick . he 's alright now but i think he 's been very very sick . 
he 's like a great big bear .   ' creasy bear ' ... 
i like him mom . 
yes mom ? 
could he speak english ? emilio could n't speak english . 
i 'm trying mom . 
creasy ... wait . 
you 're lying . i do n't believe you . 
i do n't believe you . 
planned what ? 
why are you here ? why did n't you die ? 
the traffic takes some getting used to . 
please it 's lisa ... i 'll be coming with you tomorrow . i have lunch with friends . 
it makes it all seem so serious . 
no you 're right . you were hired to protect her that 's enough . i 'm confident you 'll do that . 
you should know they 're tenacious when they want something . and pinta wants to be friends . 
yes she told me . do you have children mr. creasy ? 
how are you getting along with pinta ? 
it insults maria . slip it to the dog if you have to ... do you mind if i talk to you for a moment ? 
is the food alright ? maria tells me that you did n't eat . 
mr. creasy i wanted to make sure you have everything you need . 
you 've done much of this work before ? 
you 're american . 
the world of our children . how dare they ? 
i 'll call you from detroit baby . 
do n't forget your towel . 
well think about going to sleep . good night baby . 
you do ? 
this is mr. creasy . 
we 'll see . and thank your father in the morning . a man always needs to be thanked . 
samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard . it may take a few days but you 're going back . 
good news . you 're going back to school . 
you should be sleeping baby . 
she 's young . she 'll get over it . 
he has to go . 
it 's not . 
pinta likes him too much .   she thinks of him as a father . 
he has to go samuel . 
creasy . pinta likes him . 
she likes him . 
you realize that you 've brought a killer into the house . 
i think it 's nice he 's american . 
do you have any family mr. creasy ? 
lisa martin ramos mr. creasy . 
samuel it is not something we should skimp on . a bodyguard 's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent . now he 's gone i feel totally exposed . 
our child 's safety is at stake . 
i 'm only asking for one thing . and it 's not an extravagance . it 's not even for me ; it 's for our daughter . 
a man 's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes . only the amount matters . 
catherine you are a blanket of gloom . wherever you are the rain follows . someday you gon na smile and we gon na declare a holiday . 
i do n't sell this house i tell you that . this is my husband 's house . i had six children in this house . 
that 's the first time marty ever brought a girl to this house . she seems like a nice girl . i think he has a feeling for this girl . you heard him sing . he been singing like that all morning . 
oh sure .   this girl is a college graduate . 
well what marty you think is gon na be here in this house with a girl ? 
hey i come home from your house last night marty was here with a girl .

i know it pains . 
oh catherine please ! do n't make a tragedy . you come to my house where you know you be happier yourself .

i been getting a pain in my shoulder . 
i came to see you . how you feel ? 
well maybe that 's what they teach you in new york university . in real life it do n't work out that way . you wait till you are a mother . 
where do you think a mother - in - law should go ? 
you do n't think my sister catherine should live in her daughter - in - law 's house ? 
hobby ! what can she do ? she cooks and she cleans . you got ta have a house to clean . you got ta have children to cook for . these are the terrible years for a woman the terrible years . 
it 's a very sad business i tell you . a woman fifty - six years old all her life she had her own home . now she 's just an old lady sleeping on her daughter - in - law 's couch . it 's a curse to be a mother i tell you . your children grow up and then what is left for you to do ? what is a mother 's life but her children ? it is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home . 
well siddown a minute . i just come inna house . i 'll take off my coat . siddown a minute .

you just sit here i got ta turn the fire on under the cooking . 
we got ta ask marty of course . 
she 's right . she 's right . young husband and wife they should have their own home . and my sister catherine she 's my sister but i got ta admit she 's an old goat . and plenty - a times in my life i feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself . and i tell you now as far as i 'm concerned if catherine wantsa come live here with me and marty it 's all right with me .

they 're the worst . college girls are one step from the streets . they smoke like men inna saloon . my son joseph his wife you know she types onna typewriter . one step from the streets i tell you . mrs. pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment . 
were the lights on ? 
your son marty ? 
these are the worst years . i tell you . it 's gon na happen to you . i 'm afraida look inna mirror . i 'm afraid i 'm gon na see an old lady with white hair like the old ladies inna park little bundles inna black shawl waiting for the coffin . i 'm fifty- six years old . what am i to do with myself ? i have strength in my hands . i wanna cook . i wanna clean . i wanna make dinner for my children . am i an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close ? these are the terrible years theresa ! terrible years ! 
it pains that they should do this . 
so i am an old garbage bag put inna street . 
my son thomas came to see you this afternoon and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house ? 
what they say ? 
when was this ? 
i keep one eye open when i sleep because she 's gon na come in stab me in my bed . 
she gave me the evil eye . 
she 's a witch that one . i tell you what happen yesterday ? 
did i tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me ? 
that 's my son thomas 's baby . 
you know the old man upstairs in this house . old irishman always drunk . he got pleurisy . he was inna hospital two weeks . he died yesterday . 
well he died . you know who else died ? 
do you remember emilio digiorgio owned the tavern in abruzzi ? 
that 's nice . i got ta letter from my husband 's cousin in abruzzi . his mother died . 
that 's nice . 
i got ta pains in my shoulder too . i have a pain in my hip and my right arm aches so much i ca n't sleep . it 's a curse to be old . how you feel ? 
i got ta pain in my left side and my leg throbs like a drum . 
hey ! what are you doing here ? 
we just live one flight up . 
how do you do ? 
all right . 
i 'll wait for your call . 
i 'd like that very much . 
no marty please ... 
maybe that would be a good idea . 
oh i 'm fine . 
no thank you . i do n't think i should stay very long . 
yes i know . 
actually i do n't make friends easily . 
i 'm afraid of being lonely . 
well that 's what i was saying . my father is getting old . and we 're very close . he 's a wonderful man really ... 
... it 's really a fine opportunity for me . but i 'm not sure i want to be a department head . it 's mostly executive and administrative work . well anyway i told you about my father and he depends on me a great deal and ... 
i really should get home i told my father ... well i suppose a little while longer . i wonder if there 's any place around here i could put some makeup on ... 
i really should get home ... 
i think anything you want to do you 'll do well . 
it 's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop marty . 
i do n't . 
there 's nothing wrong with being a butcher . 
yes i know . 
yes i know . 
thank you . 
benjamin franklin high school . 
i 'm twenty - nine years old . how old are you ? 
you 're a very nice guy and i do n't know why some girl has n't grabbed you off long ago . 
i 'm having a very good time too . 
this is something recent with me this bursting into tears at the least thing . 
well the last time i was up here that 's where i sat . i sat there for an hour and a half without moving a muscle . now and then some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind . i 'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap . then i began to cry and i had to get up and go home . 
i was up here twice before . once with a friend of mine and once i came up alone . the last time ... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there ? 
goodnight mrs. pilletti . 
it was very nice meeting you mrs. pilletti . i hope i 'll see you again . 
it 's silly of me to argue about it . i do n't know the people involved . 
i do n't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life . 
well i do n't know the people of course but as a rule i do n't think a mother - in - law should live with a young couple . 
you must n't feel too harshly against her daughter - in - law . she also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for . 
could n't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time ? 
no thank you really mrs. pilletti . 
no mrs. pilletti . we were just going home . thank you very much anyway . 
yeah . lavender and old lace ! 
yeah . you too ? oh joe . . . oh i 'm sorry darling . . . why do n't we tear the building down ! 
a big rich slob like d. b. norton buys a paperand forty heads are chopped off ! 
john please let me go with you ! please john ! 
yes i did john . but ii had no idea what was going on . 
i do n't know . about three hundred thousand . 
i guess so . then what happened ? 
you were ? i thought you were chasing me ? 
ted sheldon . 
well a tall handsome ubangi i suppose . 
about me ? 
no thank you . 
uh - huh . 
oh it started as a circulation stunt but it is n't any more . mr. norton wants to get back of it and sponsor john doe clubs all over the country . he wants to send you on a lecture tour . 
uh - huh . . . 
oh but you do n't know how big this thing is . you should see the thousands of telegrams we 've received and what they 're saying about you . 
uh - huh . to carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech . 
look john . something terribly important 's happened . they 're forming john doe clubs . we know of eight already and they say that there 's going 
hello john . 
never mind . let him alone . he 's all right . i 'll be right over there pulling for you . 
you know something ? i 've actually fallen in love with him . 
john doe the one in the speech . 
john doe . the one in there . 
of course not . he would n't be . 
now look john . here 's the speech . it 's in caps and double - spaced . you wo n't have any trouble reading it . not nervous are you ? 
grab it eddie grab it ! 
oh look . i 'm the umpire and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and i call it a ball . what would you do ? 
against anything . just protest . 
never mind those guys . all right stand up . now let 's see what you look like when you protest . 
yeah . no no !   no ! no look . you do n't have to smell the world ! 
yes you 're sore at the world . come on now . 
oh come on now . this is serious . you 're a man disgusted with all of civilization . 
here . sit down !   quiet egghead !   all right now a serious expression . 
um - hum . 
he likes you well enough to stick around . 
are you all right ? 
would you be willing to say you wrote that letterand stick by it ? 
er would you er would you like to make some money ? 
john ! i 'm so glad to see you . ii was terribly worried . 
mr. d. b. norton ! 
a third party ? 
oh ! oh it 's beautiful d. b. welli do n't quite know what to say . . . 
oh somebody else sitting there ? 
better let me talk to him . 
yes sir . 
thank you very much for everything . 
how do you do . 
a hundred dollars ! 
oh i 'm sure i can . 
thirty dollars . 
yes sir . 
here . wait a minute . let me comb your hair . sit down . there . that 's better . 
no no no . this man 's going to jump off a roof . 
huh ? oh yes . let 's go .   now let 's see . we want some action in these pictures . 
hello there . well well ! if it is n't the man about town ! 
you bet i will ma . 
father 's . . . i never knew he had a diary . 
oh yes father certainly would . 
yeah i do n't know . i simply ca n't get it to jell !   i created somebody who 's gon na give up his life for a principle hundreds of thousands of people are gon na listen to him over the radio and unless he says something that 's well that 's sensational it 's just no good ! 
oh i 'm sorry ma . oh do n't pay any attention to me . i guess i 'm just upset about all this . gee whiz here i am with a great opportunity to get somewhere to give us security for once in our lives and i 'm stuck . if i could put this over your mrs. burke can have six babies ! 
if you 're thinking of that thousand dollars forget it . it 's practically gone . we owed everybody in town . now you 've just got ta stop giving all your money away . 
you 're marvelous ma . you 're just like father used to be . do you realize a couple of weeks ago we did n't have enough to eat ourselves ? 
the websters ! 
and the fifty 's all gone huh ? who 's the ten for ? 
what for ? i gave you fifty just the other day . 
yeah i know . what are you looking for ? 
stick a fork through me ! i 'm done . i 'll never get this speech right . 
thank you . 
that 's fine honey . now get out ! 
what 's the idea ? 
sure it 's a meal ticket for me . i admit it but it 's also a windfall for somebody like mr. norton who 's trying to crash national politics .   that 's what you bought the newspaper for is n't it ? you wanta reach a lotta people do n't you ?   well put john doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em . he can say anything he wants and they 'll listen to him . 
if you do mr. norton you 're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is ! excuse me . 
well what about it ?   let them see him !   we 'll go them one better . they can also hear him .   you own a radio station mr. norton . why not put him on the air ? 
before you pop too many buttons do n't forget to make out that check for a thousand . 
take it easy john doe . 
i got it all ready . here . 
friend of his . they play duets together . 
oh swell ! is that the contract ? 
we 'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomunder bodyguards . we 'll make a mystery out of him .   did you speak to mr. norton ? 
yes but not because he 's out of a job . that 's not news ! this man 's going to jump as a matter of principle . 
no no no ! you ca n't take pictures of him like thateating a sandwichand with a beard ! 
when you 're desperate for money you do a lot of things mr. connell . he 's our man i tell you . 
that 's our man . he 's made to order . 
he 's perfect ! a baseball player . what could be more american ! 
oh the chronicle would consider it dirt cheap . 
plus a bonus . 
that 's fine ! that 's fine !   now fall right into their laps . go ahead . say john doe walked in and called the whole thing off . you know what that 's going to sound like on top of this ! 
you 're supposed to be a smart guy ! if it was raining hundred dollar bills you 'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place . 
anybody ! er erbeany'll do ! 
well you 're catching on . 
the one we hire for the job you lunkhead ! 
john doe . 
now then comes the drama . he meets discouragement . he finds the world has feet of clay . his ideals crumble . so what does he do ?   he decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization . he thinks of the river !   but no no he has a better idea . the city hall . why ?   because he wants to attract attention . he wants to get a few things off his chest and that 's the only way he can get himself heard . 
sure !   when you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you do n't drop it like a hot potato . why this is good for at least a couple of months . you know what i 'd do ? between now and let 's say christmas when he 's gon na jump i 'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood his schooling his first job !   a wide - eyed youngster facing a chaotic world . the problem of the average man of all the john does in the world . 
our john doe ! the one i made up ! look genius now look . suppose there was a john doeand he walked into this office . what would you do ? find him a job and forget about the whole business i suppose ! not me ! i 'd have made a deal with him ! 
john doe . 
well the whole town 's curious about john doe and boom just like that you 're going to bury him . there 's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market ! 
uh - huh . you said you wanted fireworks . 
there is no letter . i made it up . 
there is no letter . 
there is no letter . 
what letter ? 
what 's that ? 
i remember distinctly being fired . 
oh i can do that . i know this town inside out . oh give me a chance please . 
i 'll tell you what i 'll do . i get thirty dollars a week . i 'll take twenty - five twenty if necessary . i 'll do anything you say . 
look mr. connell . . . i just ca n't afford to be without work right now not even for a day . i 've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . . 
oh let me go will you ! 
oh . gee you 're swell ! oh . 
where 's connell ? 
have you seen him ? 
has he been here ? 
oh stop worrying . he 's all right . 
well nobody asked yuh . 
how many is that six ? pretty hungry were n't you ? 
where 'd you play ? 
what do you do when you work ? 
had any schooling ? 
there 's enough in it for a hundred speeches things people ought to hear nowadays . you be careful of it wo n't you dear ?   it 's always helped keep your father alive for me . 
that 's your father 's diary ann . 
wait a minute . . . 
darling there are so many complaining political speeches . people are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio . if you 're going to have him say anything why do n't you let him say something simple and real something with hope in it ? if your father were alive he 'd know what to say . 
well honey of course i do n't know what kind of a speech you 're trying to write but judging from the samples i 've read i do n't think anybody'll listen . 
do you mean the speech you 're writing ? 
well yes i know dear but these people are in such need and we have plenty now . 
you remember those lovely people your father used to take care of ? i thought i 'd buy them some groceries . oh ann dear it 's a shame those poor 
the websters . 
yes i know dear but mrs. burke had her baby yesterday . nine pounds ! and there was n't a thing in the houseand then this morning the community chest lady came around and 
your purse . i need ten dollars . 
oh yes you will ann dear . . . you 're very clever . 
know what you are ? ! you 're a prude roper . 
you thought i was talking about getting married ? ! 
i 'm talking about me ' n ' you stripping down on this beach and gettin ' you know ... ' naked in tahiti ' . 
... the hell are you talking about ? 
that 's right . we 've got to bare it all . here and now . 'cause i think i 'm finally ready to go for it ... 
i was just thinking ...   there 's something special i want to talk to you about .   i think it 's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship .   a deeper level . 
you 've changed you know . i do n't think there 's anything you ca n't do once you put your mind to it . 
things have been going pretty well between us have n't they ? 
i 've been thinking . 
i 've never seen sea so blue . tahiti is magnificent scottie . 
scottie scottie ... 
i think i 'll stand out here in the sun . 
i do n't think you 're old and fat enough for me . 
and you think he 'll ... 
in europe women find older men very sexy . 
there is ? 
it 's very nice . 
how 's paco doing ? 
just now . 
it 's okay . we broke up . 
it 's not that world . it 's your world . it 's part of who you are . 
scottie remember the day you lost that hostage in union square . you came over that night and we made mad crazy love . but i did n't even know what happened ... ' til i heard it on the news the next morning . 
yeah that 's it . 
mmm needs a little something . 
and it 's hard to get . 
no . the kind from kraft with the macaroni and the cheese . 
it 's already started . 
you got a bet on the game tonight ? 
if you did you never showed it . 
do n't try to make me feel guilty . the whole time we were together you went out of your way to prove you did n't need me . now suddenly for one night you need me again . i ca n't do it . i ca n't be more than your friend . because i know what will happen . in a few weeks you 'll be back on top and you 'll shut me out just as soon as you do n't need me again . 
what do you want from me ? 
scott you ca n't save everyone . 
you do n't usually talk to anyone when you 're hurting . 
about 4 months old . i 'm working in a new style . 
yeah . i 'm sorry . 
maybe you should be . 
a little late for that scottie . he 's asleep .   jack daniels ? 
oh i 've got to get a shot of this . 
i 'm going out with greg tomorrow . 
you know what i think ? i think you only want me now because i 'm with somebody else . 
you worship yourself . 
really ? ! he 's a wonderful guy . he makes two million a year and he worships me . 
there was no other choice . 
i 'm sorry . 
what 's the difference ? 
but you were with me . 
i was n't with you . 
way you kiss me . 
and it meant something . 
for what ? 
but i do n't know anything about programming . 
you said we were on the same programming team . 
that 's not possible .   no one can do that . 
-- the inside ?

the thing is i 'm responsible for the way he 's acting . it 's the nightmare juice . it 's got to be . 
five cc 's . 
what 's the maximum safe dose ? 
left - handed he was < u > funny</u > . he 'd been doing all this scary intense work ... then he found out he could draw this stuff and make me laugh and he liked that . < i></i > and then the nightmares just ... stopped . 
i 'm serious . it was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance . he was a rightie so i made him switch the pencil to his left hand . just to see what 'd come out . 
switch hands . 
he had n't gotten a good night 's sleep in years . the nightmares would wake him up and he 'd start right in painting ... < i></i > that boy looked like pluperfect hell . 
yeah ... before your time . 
stu . that was right about the time we met . 
i do n't know . i guess it was ... 
oh poor buster . he has n't been fed in a day and a half . let me get some food ... 
kool - aid ! ? but who 'd would want to - 
what 'll it do if they pull the plug ? 
i do n't want to < u > stop</u > the nightmare hutch . i want to crank it up . i want to take it right off the charts . i want to < u > scare him awake</u > . 
no . i want to give him < u > more</u > . i want to give him a massive dose . 
he 's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop . < i></i > anybody here know what oneirix is ? 
but the heirloom ring . your grandmother 's ring ... 
it looks so ... <u > new</u > . 
you 're wearing a < u > topcoat</u > stu . - where are your pants ? 
baby do n't lie . i know you went out . 
stu ? is that you ? where did you < u > go</u > ? 
what 's this about merchandising ? you always hated merchandising ! 
i had to park two blocks away . is something -

i 'm heading in to work baby . are you sure you 'll be okay ? 
well . as long as it 's okay with monkeybone -

you 're acting kind of ... odd . 
stu are you ... feeling okay ? 
baby ? why do n't you just ... rest on the sofa for a minute . i 'll be right back . 
oh baby i ca n't believe you 're back . 
what 's the matter ? 
oh stu . tell me i 'm not dreaming . 
it was great baby . let 's get you to the er . 
i 'm fine baby . we 're all okay . we were lucky . 
i do n't think so . 
< i></i > if you do i 'll be right there beside you . so face it . you 're just going to have to be happy ! 
stu - stop it . that monkey is < u > good luck</u > . you thought him up and everybody loves him and he 's probably going to make you rich . so relax ! enjoy it ! 
ca n't you give it to me later ? 
it was you who got the standing o. it was you drawing on the belly over there ... 
you want to leave ? but stu - you 're a big hit ! everyone loves you !

the ring ... 
i 'm fine kimmy . fine .

i 'm just concerned about my daughter . 
and you do n't deal drugs ? 
my daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe .   is that true ? 
excuse me sir .   i just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday .

oh let me get out of your way then . 
oh please do n't hurt me . 
goodbye sweetheart . 
mm hmm . 
i can make my own decisions . 
at my age i 'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better . 
dear i was thinking .   why do n't we go to paris next year ?   i 've never been .   your father god bless him was n't much for traveling . 
oh i do n't want to be in the way . you 've got your career and everything . 
mm hmm . 
i 'm sorry . 
oh i hope so dear . 
if it 's about the bikers dear i do n't want to talk about it . 
oh that has nothing to do with it . 
what 's wrong ? 
my daughter lives right across the street from the satan 's disciples ' clubhouse and i was so worried about her ... so i went over and introduced myself . and they were the nicest people . 
oh it 's so nice to meet you . 
you know you never tell me anything . 
he seemed quite taken with you . 
but i was dusting . 
well they were right out in plain view . 
you know ...   ... whoops ! 
what about the fellow in those pictures ? 
dating anyone ? 
how are you doing sweetheart ? 
i just ca n't seem to focus on anything these days . 
the motorcycle gang ?   do n't they deal drugs and rape young girls ? 
... what are they all doing there ? 
i wanted to ask you something .   those motorcycles across the street ... ? 
well when i walked up the block i ... well my word ! 
well once you 're inside it 's nice . 
i wonder what they do in there ?   do n't they frighten you ?   they all look so ... 
he 's an organic farmer . 
you know you ought to come out to south dakota some time and meet my son steve . he 's single . 
poor man had to leave town .   and i hear that other women came forward . 
oh it was such a big scandal . 
men ... they 're all the same .   our pastor in sioux falls was caught with his wife 's sister . 
oh .   you need a cappuccino . 
she 's at work .   i 'm her mother . 
who is it ? 
forty - five ?   i thought it was only supposed to be thirty ? 
i see .   how much ? 
this way ? 
you mean it 's dangerous ? 
ohhh .   do you know the east village ? 
i 'm from south dakota .   where are you from ? 
... and the children thought i should take a trip . 
uh yes .   my husband passed away recently ... 
she would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but she just started a new job and well i guess no one drives here . 
i came to new york to visit my youngest daughter . 
i 'm sorry i 'm a little nervous .   it 's my first time in new york .   just a minute . 
are you sure you got my bag in ? 
well bye .   and have a safe trip ... and ... paris in the spring ! 
i love you mom .   i have to run .   you remembered to call the limousine service right ? 
here you go .   i think you should talk to dr. byrne when you get back about how much valium he 's prescribing .   okay ? 
i 'd love to . 
you would n't be in the way .   i like having you around . 
i think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer . 
it 's unusually quiet tonight is n't it ? 
yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk . 
you know that guy in the pictures you saw ? 
no i had a dream about daddy .   do you think i 'll ever meet anyone like him ? 
mom i need to talk to you . 
no no it 's my fault .   i 've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own . 
mom ... i mean it 's amusing to imagine such a thing but ... how many of those pills have you been taking ? 
mother i ... 
don this is my mother .   mom this is my boss don palmer . 
that 's not true .   besides i do n't want you dusting .   i want you to see new york . 
i do n't want to talk about it . 
i was seeing aaron and there were some ... complications . 
behind the books . 
what pictures ? 
no i 'm working too much i do n't have time . 
i 'm good . 
that 's why it 's good you came to visit me . 
i 've never had any problem with them . people say it 's the safest block in the east village .   i just hope their motorcycles do n't keep you up at night . 
that 's the satan 's disciples ' new york headquarters . 
uh - huh ? 
that 's new york .   it looks rundown but it 's safe during the day .   you 'll get used to it . 
you do n't like where i live ? 
so what do you think ? 
freedom of the press ! mr. james taylor blindfolding a whole state--   wait a minute ! if that 's how he wants to play * i 'll * get through to that bunch -- i'll get plenty of words into that state-- !   come on diz get that stuff you 've written -- let me have it-- 
diz -- get what he says to the people back in that state . it 's up to you and the boys . keep those wires hot . fire away pal ! 
the war 's on ! 
well then that 's great ! and that 's a great place to leave it ! it 's no use * my * barging into this now and-- 
you do n't think he 'd want * me * within fifty miles do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give ! did you see his * face*-- ? 
why me ? 
i 've told you ten times -- if i had anything they could n't bat down in a second do n't you suppose i 'd 've been up in that hearing yelling murder ! sure -- he was cooked the night i sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works ! 
take me home diz . 
right now -- everything i own-- ! 
i 'm getting out of there . right now diz . right now . bonus or no bonus . i 'm gon na clear outa that office-- everything i own -- my extra hat-- everything-- 
i wo n't take it ! see ? i wo n't be party to murder . see ? steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting taylor mob is low enough . but helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides -- nobody 's gon na make me do that . no sir . 
nothing like -- uh -- susan -- or anything like that huh ? 
you do n't know a name off - hand you like better do you diz ? 
they decoyed the little general off to a tea party to keep him out of the senate . 
that 's taking place outside now . 
did you like the first act ? 
diz -- don quixote with bill is going to get to his feet in a minute and speak two important words--*willet creek * . when that happens -- if my hunch is right -- the silver knight will fall off his tightrope and puss will jump out of his boots . 
you play -- left field . 
the silver knight . soul of honor -- on a tight - rope . 
that gorilla in man 's clothing-- mcgann . 
ah . one of the supporting characters . 
certainly .   now there 's the principal actor in our little play . 
sit tight diz . the show commences in just a minute . 
wait -- wait . let 's see -- watchdog mcgann-- he 's bound to move right in -- get him out of the way first--   pardon me friend -- i've got some telephoning to do-- ! 
get my * whole * fall outfit -- and quit this job in style ! 
whadaya mean--*right * ? 
i 'm still asking myself -- what is he-- animal vegetable or mineral ? a senator ! a united states senator ! i thought i 'd seen everything but-- why he does n't know what time it is diz ! when i think of myself sitting around -- playing straight for all that phoney patriotic chatter-- * me * carrying bibs for an infant with little flags in his fists -- no i ca n't take it diz -- i'm through -- i quit ! 
yeah . should have seen me seven years ago -- when i came to this town . * now * what am i?--chambermaid to the pied piper of jackson city ; * honorary * appointment ! scratch this thing an you 'll find they wanted a dope here for two months . 
what ! who ? 
no -- don't do it . i 'm sure . the truth is diz -- there 's no man i 've seen yet or -- must be something wrong with me . i 've been feeling low for weeks . 
diz you 're a swell playmate -- but-- . maybe if i saw you once with your hair combed or something -- or -- no no -- i do n't think even that would do it-- 
oh -- that again . yeah . 
what 's this diz ? 
when foley died why did n't i clear out ? how many times did you hear me say i was fed up on politics and-- ? but * no*--i let 'em talk me into staying . secretary to a leader of little squirts . why ? because i need the job and a new suit of clothes . 
tell me why ! 
well why do n't they try the police-- get some blood hounds -- or indian guides-- 
no not yet senator paine -- not hide nor hair of the man . you mean to say the boys haven't-- ? 
okay . for the dollar i give you mcgann * and * bill and carl . i got paine .   hello ... oh yes . 
well -- who d'you take this time -- paine bill carl -- or mcgann ? 
i give that trail blazer five more minutes to show up--   --*five more minutes * ! 
sure -- sure . he must have a compass with him . 
how do you * like * this ! you do n't suppose that ranger met up with some kids -- and took 'em for a hike ! 
sure . sure . i 'll hang a light in the steeple . one if by land -- two if by sea ! ... okay !   diz -- you wo n't believe it . daniel boone 's * lost * ! 
jeff -- wait -- they want you to speak ! 
to a hard night 's work son . come on ! 
we 'll * find * one ! only throw compromise out of the window -- stick to jeff smith the man who first came to this town -- get up and * fight*-- and we 'll find * some * way . i do n't know where we 'll wind up -- but the flag'll be flying-- ! 
jeff -- listen -- remember the day you got here?--what you said about mr. lincoln?--that he was sitting up there -- watching -- waiting for someone to come along ? well -- that was * you * . someone with a little plain decent uncompromising * rightness*--to root out the taylors -- yeah and really light up that dome for once . this country could use some of that -- so could the whole drunken cockeyed world right now -- a * lot * of it ! and when the right man comes along -- no matter * what * the odds -- he ca n't * ever * quit ! a little fellow called david walked out with only a sling- shot -- but he had the * truth * on his side-- 
i do n't care * what * you 've done ! do n't quit . do n't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces -- other men could -- but not you . as long as you lived you 'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals-- ! 
what you * have * to do is fight ! 
i * do n't * think that 's the thing to do ! no ! i think what you ought to do is--*fight * ! 
well i guess it 's a chance . 
it might save some of the pieces jeff . it would leave a doubt about the whole thing -- about you . might blow over this way . 
what are you going to do ? 
no . that night -- i -- well * you * know-- i was pretty-- . no -- diz is a -- a sort of brother that 's all-- 
i 'm not . 
and you 're writing ma all about it . and your pigeons will carry the message of love . and the first thing you know -- susan paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted ! 
get your hat senator . we 've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow-- 
yes -- right here . just a second--   miss paine . 
do n't mention it-- 
thanks a lot . 
do you want to dictate them ? 
not another bill ? 
second drawer . 
oh those are only local . wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country . 
contributions from boys who read about your camp . 
must have been tickled pink . 
one of the plagues on members of congress -- office - seekers cranks people with pet bills . get my son into west point -- or * outta * west point . i 've got a scheme to put people to work . how do i get rid of cockroaches ? some woman 's composed a hymn to replace the star spangled banner . want to hear it ? 
no i have n't . i guess i thought the name was familiar .   by the way you discussed with senator paine where the camp was to be situated and everything ? 
in terry canyon ? 
and a beautiful woman too -- don't you think ? 
now * susan*--that 's really a * pretty * name-- 
you win . it's -- clarissa . 
no ! stop it ! 
it * is * not ! 
well if it 's all the same to you-- 
look -- i think we ought to skip it . 
i also answer to whistles . 
terrible thank you . 
go right ahead . 
i do n't see where we are * with * it . 
have i ? 
no complaints . 
no they could n't . father was a doctor . the kind who placed ethics above collections . that speaks well for father but it always left us kind of--   could we get on with this senator ? 
since sixteen or so . 
city - dwellers never do that -- for fear of what might drop * in * 'em . 
baltimore . pure city - dweller . 
now this camp is going to be out in your state of course-- 
uh -- getting back to this senator-- 
he did ? 
but you 've just taken care of the spirit all right . 
on paper ? 
now let 's get down to particulars . how big is this thing ? where is it to be ? how many boys will it take care of ? if they 're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions ? your bill has to have all that in it-- 
try sitting down . 
yes senator--*twice * . 
thanks very much . 
yes -- sure . why not ?   you do n't mind if i take the time to get a pencil ? 
yes . house . more amendments -- more changes -- and the bill goes back to the senate -- and * waits its turn on the calendar again * . the senate does n't like what the house did to the bill . they make more changes . the house does n't like * those * changes . stymie . so they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out . besides that all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against -- government departments get in their two cents ' worth -- cabinet members -- budget bureaus -- embassies . finally if the bill is alive after all this vivisection it comes to a vote . yes sir -- the big day finally arrives . and -- nine times out of ten they vote it down .   are you catching on senator ? 
pardon me--*this * is . where are we now ? 
a committee of the majority party leaders . they decide when a bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list-- 
do you really think we 're getting anywhere . 
that 's the order of business . your bill has to stand * way * back there in line unless the steering committee decides it is important enough to be-- 
yes . they give it to a * sub*- committee where they really give it a going over -- hold hearings -- call in people and ask questions -- then report back to the bigger committee -- where it 's considered some more changed amended or whatever . days are going by senator . days -- weeks . finally they think it 's quite a bill . it goes over to the house of representatives for debate and a vote . * but * it 's got to wait its turn on the calendar-- 
good . where are we ? 
look -- committees -- small groups of senators -- have to sift a bill down-- look into it -- study it -- and report to the whole senate . you ca n't take a bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety - six men . where would you get ? 
that 's how congress -- or any large body -- is run . all work has to be done by committee . 
you get to your feet in the senate and present it . then you take the bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box -- on the side of the rostrum . just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in . clerks read it and refer it to the right committee-- 
uh - huh . well dinner comes in on trays . we 're executives . and we light into this . it is dawn . your bill is ready . you go over there and introduce it-- 
tonight .   look -- uh -- i do n't want to seem to be complaining senator -- but in all civilized countries there 's an institution called * dinner*-- ! 
a * day * ! 
oh yes . and * i 'm * helping . simple-- and i 'm helping . so we knock this off in record - breaking time of -- let 's say three or four days-- 
i see . * this * one is so simple-- 
fine . now what does he do ? he 's got to sit down first and write it up . the where when why how -- and everything else . that takes time-- 
if i were * triplets * i couldn't-- . look senator -- let me give you a rough idea . a member has a bill in mind -- like you -- a camp . right ? 
my dear senator have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a bill passed ? 
pardon me . senator paine decided this * with * you ? 
one moment senator . do i understand you 're going to present a * bill * ? 
we 're going right ahead with--*what * ? 
i had a lot to do with that little press conference last night-- 
go ahead -- punch . 
you * could n't * ? 
oh -- a wonderful thing -- yes . get you right in the mood -- yes -- yes . 
no . what had you better-- ? 
with or without 'em .   twelve -- noon . the senate convenes at twelve o'clock . 
you -- uh -- you better relax senator . you 'll be plumb wore out . 
i would n't know in the * day time * . 
now if you 're ready senator we can start for the hotel . i 'll * see * that you get there . 
well -- he 's got nothing on me . 
most natural thing in the world ! 
there * what * was ? 
did you say -- bus ? 
yes i 'm saunders -- and this is mr. moore -- a member of the press . meet the * senator * mr. moore . 
oh no -- no !   my dear * senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take french leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours-- 
what 's your name ? 
* no * ! 
what is it ? 
why he 's a senator is n't he ? i 'm surprised at you mister mcgann-- 
the head man 's writing a bill . 
i would n't wait if i were you . 
my my -- you sho ' are pahwerfully upset mister mcgann -- but you ' awfully cute . 
that 's what he 's been doing since last heard from . 
how 'd you like a punch in the nose ? 
well that 's out . either it 's * lots * of reporters and * lots * of tickets or-- . now will you go and call 'em before i change my mind about the whole thing ! 
look nosey -- your pals would like to get in on this would n't they ? 
well well ! 
go away nosey . 
he did it . 
so i go right back where i was-- carrying compromises -- covering up-- back to political tricks -- this time for-- ! no ! i was just getting rid of all that . if i did * anything * i ought to go and tell him to stand up and-- . no ! i do n't want any part of it ! smith or anything else ! i 'm all through . i want to be left alone ! 
* me ! me * ! i * still * do n't see why i should-- ! if you love him so much why do n't you go to him yourself and-- ? or better still -- get up in that senate and * fight * for him ! 
all right--*yes * ! and what does that make me to him ? * nothing * ! i 've got to go about my own business -- and forget it ! 
what are you talking about ? what difference-- ? 
well -- me too ! 
why do n't you do it yourself ? 
what are you driving at ? you want * me * to get him to sign that ? 
what do you want senator ? 
well when i first came to washington my eyes were big blue question marks-- now they 're big green dollar marks-- 
yeah ?   and what else ? 
yeah -- i see i 'm right where i 've been for seven years-- 
and i 'm an old hand at following instructions-- 
nice * compliment * ! 
look senator -- i was n't given a brain just to tell a boy ranger what time it is . what do you need me for ? get somebody else -- get a registered nurse-- 
that 's right . 
yes . he went to mount vernon to give himself a patriotic address . 
no -- i'm sorry . i merely saw him home . i 'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle . that 's mcgann 's job . 
the ranger 's notices ? no idea at all . 
you want to see me senator ? 
well your children are very bright-- and * they * say jefferson smith . 
no wonder -- without your dinner . 
why i think it 's very sweet of the children-- 
nonsense . why do n't you listen to your children for a change ? you might actually learn something ? 
we 're waiting hubert . 
dinner hubert . 
save that for the laying of cornerstones hubert !   oh that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman ! 
this is n't a home it 's the crossroads of the world ! 
ca n't that wait hubert ? 
whom are you calling -- in the dead of night ? 
great saints ! 
what is it ? 
what is it ? 
that infernal phone ! 
i knew it ! i knew a night 's rest was n't possible in this house !   hubert ! 
you 're not going to take your * suit * off ! 
well -- i-- 
well ! you do n't say ! 
and how 's your bill senator ? 
i 'm splendid too . 
then you * did * say it . 
did you hear father ? he did n't mean it when he said i was beautiful . 
how are the pigeons ? 
well we * must * see a lot of you senator . come father . 
what ! not ol' honest abe ! 
how nice . how do you do senator ? 
father -- oh . 
such pretty knees for a big boy ! 
i 'm afraid we wo n't have room in the car father . senator smith can follow with mr. mcgann and the pigeons . 
how nice . 
i do n't care to meet anybody until i get paid -- come on -- come on . one dollar each please for the milk fund . 
would you like to go for a walk ? 
why not ? 
you do n't go out with girls very much do you ? 
no . are you ? 
yes ! ! ! 
what 's that got to do with it ? 
what 's that got to do with it ? 
oh thank you ! 
it is n't all ! i 'd like to explain 
yes but i 
they 're colored ! just to make him look silly ! 
no ! ! 
no ! i resigned last week ! 
it 's obviously a frameup ! they 're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him ! 
oh hello darling . 
yes of course . 
yes here we are again .   good night . 
a girl ? 
no i do n't mind . 
i do n't blame you . 
are you ? when ? 
let 's just walk okay ? 
thank you . 
i 'll get my hat . 
you threw them out ! 
i did n't think you could come with the party and everything . 
i 'd like to read it some time . 
well that 's very nice . thank you . 
no - not at all . i could n't sleep either . 
it had better be good . 
oh i suppose you could do better . 
the drums . he taught me to play some . 
yeah i know . 
he played in the town band too . 
i 've often thought about going back . 
probably as small as mandrake falls . 
i 'm from a small town too you know . 
you must have met a lot of swell society girls since you 've been here . do n't you like them ? 
what did you mean by that ? 
you said i was a lady in distress . 
you know you said something to me when you first met me that i 've thought about a great deal . 
here 's a nice place . 
oh they just do it to sell the newspapers you know . 
you 're worried about those articles they 're writing about you are n't you ? 
why do n't you try ? 
there 's times square . 
now what do you see ? 
i say to most people it 's a washout . 
to most people it 's an awful letdown . 
there you are . grant 's tomb . i hope you 're not disappointed . 
yeah let 's . 
would you like to walk the rest of the way ? it 's so nice out . 
uh - huh . 
what are they going to do ? 
what did they say ? 
what did they say ? 
oh . what 's happening about the opera ? 
well i 'd like to - but i have a job to think of . 
i enjoy it . 
oh i do n't mind . 
you 've been having quite an exciting time here have n't you ?   all those meetings and business deals and society people - have n't you been having fun ? 
oh that was so lovely . thank you . 
well i guess i 've told you almost everything there is to tell . my folks live in a small town near hartford . i 'm down here alone trying to make a living .   oh i 'm really just a nobody . 
mmm it tastes so good . mr. deeds i do n't know how i can ever thank you . 
well i guess i walked too much . i 've been looking for a job all day . i found one too . i start tomorrow .   you 've been awfully kind . thank you very much . 
oh no really - i 'll be all right . 
no thank you . i 'll be all right . 
oh did i ? i 'm sorry . . . 
we 're not going out tonight . 
what else can i do ? keeping this up is no good . he 's bound to find out sometime .   at least i can save him that . 
tell him i had to leave suddenly . i got a job in china - some place . 
i just could n't stand seeing him again . 
no - of course you do n't . we 've forgotten . we 're too busy being smart - alecks .   too busy in a crazy competition for nothing . 
he 's got goodness mabel . do you know what that is ? 
is he ? yeah i thought so too . i tried to laugh but i could n't . it stuck in my throat . 
here 's a guy that 's wholesome and fresh . to us he looks like a freak . you know what he told me tonight ? he said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms . 
yeah then what ? 
why ? why do we have to do it ? 
i 'm crucifying him . 
mabel that guy 's either the dumbest the stupidest the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he 's the grandest thing alive . i ca n't make him out . 
good night . 
i ca n't write it mabel ! i do n't know what 's the matter with me . 
do n't be ridiculous . 
no . it 's nothing . 
hello . . . 
this is for you   mac . the names of all the headwaiters in town . you can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices . 
telling him is the long shot - i 'm going to take it . 
that 's the rub . 
he 'll probably kick me right down the stairs . i only hope he does . 
i 'm having lunch with him today . he expects an answer . it 's going to be pretty . 
i 'm going to tell him the truth . 
yeah . funny twist is n't it ? 
print one line of that and i 'll blow your place up ! 
last night he proposed to me . 
with pay !   she is out the door . 
oh no . no . our deal was for a month 's vacation - with pay . 
i even moved into mabel dawson 's apartment - in case old snoopy cobb might start looking around . 
tonight maybe .   i 'll phone him at noon .   oh my lunch hour . i 'm a stenographer you know . mary dawson . 
i do n't know . i had to duck to get the story out . he was so far along he never even missed me . 
had the boys follow us . 
if we could sell tickets we 'd make a fortune . 
he 's the original . there are no carbon copies of that one . 
i was the world 's sweetest ingenue . 
it took some high - powered acting believe me . 
have lunch . 
leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow . 
with pay ! 
can i have a month 's vacation ? 
oh he 's not getting away with anything . 
look i can do it ! 
why there she is !   of course she 's home .   stupid of me . . . 
just a minute . no you do n't . 
you 're acting like a school girl . 
what 'll i tell him if he calls up ? 
running away is no solution . 
you 're a fool babe . 
aw cut it out will you ? you 'll get me thinking about charlie again . 
the guy 's balmy . 
search me . ask the gypsies . 
you started out to be a successful newspaper woman did n't you ? 
people have been crucified before . 
uh - huh . 
you have n't gotten very far have you ? that 's where you were an hour ago . come on let 's knock off and go down to joe 's . the gang 's waiting for us . 
my unfailing instinct tells me something 's gone wrong with the stew . 
what 's up babe ? something 's eating you . 
what 's the matter hon ? 
thank you so much . good night . 
oh yes i think it 'd be a swell night to go for a walk . a nice long one . 
yes lovely . we 've had a lot of nice weather lately . 
you mean   by the neck or something ? 
yeah . what ? 
huh ? oh yes - yes of course . her sister . yes i 've been her sister for a long time . 
-- when i was in high school the thing i wanted most when i was stuck in class the thing i was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass . that 's all i wanted . i loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there ... and that 's how i feel right now ... like i have some giant all- day hall pass . 
i know my time 's up but i 've got to get this out while i 've got hold of it -- 
it 's happened before .   i 'm shocked by how little i 'm feeling . i ca n't understand it .   i 'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon wo n't i ? 
we argued on sunday . he went to work on monday and stayed in the city during the week like always . but on thursday when he normally comes home he did n't . did n't call either . not till saturday afternoon . 
it 's irrelevant . it had nothing to do with what happened . 
oh all the great writers -- shakespeare charles dickens moby dick ... those people . each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents . it 's a magnificent set -- and only $ 33.50 per volume . right away you get great expectations for just $ 6.99 . 
-- the argument had nothing to do with it . 
yes . jeremy will be home for the weekend . and you can meet the kids . 
i said ... you must come out to the house for dinner on thursday . 
mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm . 
they said if i did n't get help they would n't deal with me any more .   what do you think about that ? 
it 's the kids you know not jeremy . he had nothing to do with this -- except pay of course . he 's always willing to pay . he 's extremely generous .   i 'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me . 
why are they ganging up against me ? 
what do they want from me ?   what have i done that 's so wrong ?   they act as though they do n't have their own peculiar things ... they do ! believe me . everybody 's got something ...   even you probably have things . 
well come on in . 
you do ? 
meat loaf turkey quesadillas or salad nicoise . 
it 's okay . they pre - order . there 's a choice of three entrees . 
i 'd better get in there . 
i 've seen you going by on your board but i did n't realize -- you 're so young ... to be so ... 
too bad . that 's tough i mean it . i 'm not unsympathetic . but skip says you 're in love . 
clean up the mess . no matter what it takes . 
here it is some advice -- do the hard thing . 
yes you do you damn well do . 
i want to give you something . will you let me ? 
skip and i would n't have got together if it were n't for you . that 's a big deal . 
i do n't want you to be mad at skip ... 
... so accomplished . 
it 's a pleasure to meet you . 
you 're on your own today honey . 
they come through a few times each year .   hello mrs. saito good to see you again !   it 's a tour . 
no gentleman caller doc .   not that i care . i 've had it with men . they 're so fascinated by their own crap . took me four years to get the last one out . almost turned me into a dyke ... these days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed . now that feels good . and you do n't have to do all that ... listening . 
shocking . did you know the government is wasteful ?   you heard it here first . oh and being a supermodel ... it 's no walk in the park . 
it was insane here man . ' hadda call in the national guard .   then i did my laundry ... watched 20/20 . 
and the brocketts ? 
do we run into the street ? no i did n't think so .   nice car . how 's that place ? 
doc .   ainge ... 
not sure . let me think about it . 
so what makes you so popular ? what 's your secret ? 
you know who that is do n't you ?   you really do n't ? that 's skip skipperton man . he gets himself hit by a truck this whole town shuts down . 
four months two and a half weeks -- that 's how long .   and you 've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined . 
how long you been in this town ? 
you 're terrible . i 'm never telling you anything . 
man you see him a lot . and it 's very wrong to reveal it . next you 'll be saying what his problem is . 
i think it 's like ... inquisitive . 
who was that ? 
you 're early ... it 's not ready . what happened ? 
mother ... go away ! 
dr. mumford does yes . i 've put myself completely in his hands . for today anyway . 
we 're going for a walk . 
hello mother . i want you to meet dr. mumford . 
of course ... i have n't got the energy to get out of town that fast . 
we 're only talking about six weeks . 
you got off easy . 
what is your name ? 
... but first you have to tell me something ... 
i do n't know . depends . i 'm in a bad mood . 
but nothing ... i 'm mad as hell . this is a terrible thing you 've done . 
i am irate ! 
you deserve it . 
you feel violated ? 
... how violated i feel ? 
which show was that ? 
i think you can understand why i have some serious questions about your methods . i mean obviously it becomes much more likely that i 'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs - ville and do all these highly romantic activities -- 
yes and that is what i have got right now . i have taken my feelings of gratitude ... and relief ... and transferred them onto ... you . i have taken all those warm grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you ... so that now i am under the delusion ...   ... that i am in love with you . 
i know a little about psychology . i took three different courses in college . it 's true none of them were above the two hundred level but i took them ... and there was one concept i remember very well . 
the point is this -- i am not a blank page . i did not just fall off the turnip truck . do you know what i mean ? 
i 'm saying that since i 'm doing so much better -- which i attribute to you -- i 'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings . 
given that i 'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way . 
first of all i have been feeling much better lately . i do n't know if the syndrome is over -- if it 's just run its course or something -- but i feel a hundred per cent better than when i first came to you . 
all right ... i 'm going to come right out and say this because that 's what your shrink is for right so you can tell him what 's bothering you ? 
no it is not something i 've heard about you ! it is someth--   why ? is there something i should have heard about you ? 
how intuitive ! that must take years of training right there . maybe you can guess what has upset me . 
yes something 's very wrong dr. mumford . 
it might 've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor - patient relationship . 
i need to talk to you ... doctor . can i come in ? 
thanks to this therapy i now know what i 'm looking for . i need to find a man like you .   not one who 's treating me of course .   and i 'm going to do it dammit ! you 've given me the confidence . 
you 're shockingly honest that 's what makes you great . i 've never had a man treat me this way . with you i feel really ... listened to .   can i tell you something ? it 's a little embarrassing but i feel very unguarded with you . 
yes ! and my ex - husband -- he never accepted me for who i was just like mother . the things you 've said have helped me understand what a dick he is . 
i ca n't tell you how much i admire you . you have a wonderful way with people . and you 're very insightful . i feel like you 've seen me clearly ... i never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was . you 've made that possible for me . 
-- you 've been a tremendous help to me . 
i bet i know what changed your mind ...   ... my mother . she was so horrible you decided you could n't desert me . 
my brother said you were about to fire me . 
why 'd you come to the house the other night ? 
which thing ? 
when i was in high school we used to come up here and make out . i liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down . 
and this is legitimate therapy ? 
it 's all right . 
i 'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this . how hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old ? 
and he 's where ? 
so whose route is this ? 
no that 'd be a good story but that was just the beginning of the end . we went on for another year or so . 
and i 'll bet you can interpret the whole thing 
that was really bad was n't it ? 
... who thinks there 's nothing really wrong with me . 
you 're purposely making me talk while we do this ...   ... because you think this is good for me ...   ... and you 're a sadistic bastard ... 
oh ... this makes me sound irrational which is probably right but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he 'd told me about some preference of his . well i was so ... tired of it .   seems like my whole life someone 's been telling me ... i 'm just not getting it right . can we rest for a second ? 
i do n't know if i 'm going to make it the whole way . 
well then my life has been some kind of huge rip . 
you actually address yourself by name in your thoughts ?   so you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage ? 
is that like a party trick ? 
no not really . they 're about the same . my marriage was one long headache . 
i do n't know if i mentioned the headaches . 
yes yes and definitely yes . also ... i get confused . 
uh - huh . 
well ... i 'm tired all the time obviously . i always feel like taking a nap . but when i try to sleep i have trouble .   my muscles ache . and my joints . i feel like an old person or like i did back when i used to work out too hard ... what else ? ... 
i 'm embarrassed . the list is so long . 
'cause i 'll tell you none of the others have tried this approach . 
is this the treatment ? 
you 've got a funny idea of funny . 
we do n't discuss it . 
is that the technical description of what i 've got ? 
she 's not in a bad mood . she 's like that all the time .   it does n't bother me anymore . it 's my dad and my brother i worry about . 
mom 's such a cutie . 
oh boy ... this should be interesting . 
i 'm not making any promises . 
can i ask you something ?   did n't you tell my dad you did n't think it was a good idea to come to the patient ?   so what changed ? 
is it contagious ? 'cause everyone agrees my immune system 's way down . 
you have the best answer for everything .   you seem so ... hopeful . are you always this sunny ? 
i do n't think i can afford it . i do n't want my dad paying . 
i do n't know . i barely made it today . 
what would you do ? 
even if you do n't think it 's real ? 
hmm ? is that a professional opinion ? 
no ... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final . that 's not too suspicious is it ? ... but it was n't like i was feeling bad about the divorce . just the opposite . 
i saw it . i saw it in your eyes . 
you think that now ! you think it 's a bunch of hooey do n't you ? 
about six months ago i guess it is now . god it seems like years . what a bore ! i 'm embarrassed by it . before this happened -- when i 'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- i thought it was a bunch of bullshit . 
oh lord . it 's almost too exhausting to tell you ...   ... about my exhaustion . i did n't really want to come . i 'm not hopeful right now . but i could n't take the look on my dad 's face . he 's a truly kind person which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story . he 's the opposite of me i guess -- all stamina and resolve . 
i 'd better not i 'll fall right to sleep . i think it 's too soon for me to be sleeping with you . 
he 's pitiful doc a goddam puppy . i do n't know how much longer i can put up with it . i already got two arms and legs i do n't need another appendage . 
i do n't know if i can quit . we 're gon na try it together like you know aa or something . and i made him give up his .22 . no more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune . 
i said i 'd consider it . nobody owns me . and the last thing was insane . i do n't know what 's wrong with him ... no magazines . 
... what balls on this guy ? what 're we ...   ... going steady ? jesus . 
first off he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes . i told him abso - fuckin'- lutely no . as you can see -- 
no . i do n't know what he wants . but i know i do n't like being watched . nobody 's ever paid any attention to what i did and i liked it just fine . where does he get off telling me i disrespect myself ?   fuck him . look in a mirror bozo . 
there 's this kid at school ... martin brockett . he has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares . you would n't believe the crap he lays on me ... who appointed him my spiritual leader ? if he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle ? and why 's he spend all his time chasing after me ? probably thinks i 'm gon na give him a hummer ... 
this shrink school you went to ... did you hear about it on an infomercial ? 
i do n't think you know what you 're talking about . 
these appointments were not my idea remember . 
what are you talking about ? 
i want to have the session . i thought it would be cool if i could show you some of the things that interest me . but i guess you 're not into it ... which we already knew . 
what are you doing ? we 're not done . i just need to find the thing ... 
just chill for a second . look at this guy it appears he 's actually dead ... but gorgeous . 
is n't she amazing ? that is such a wicked look . 
it 's a really weird thing for a shrink to say ... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they 'd accept that some things do n't change -- that it 'd be some kind of a relief or something ... 
i knew you would n't answer . i 've been thinking about what you said last time . how me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions . how maybe i ca n't lose the weight ever ...   which we already knew ... 
have women found you attractive ? 
pro boner ?   pro bono huh ? for whose good supposedly ? 
the school board does n't pay you ? what kind of deal is that ? 
do n't do that thing ...   ... that shrink thing . 
monthly ! god how shallow do you think brad is ? why do i waste my time telling you this stuff ? 
in maybe three or four issues . 
oh yes always . 
what just happened ? 
that 's one way of putting it . 
i 'm thinking that if the black book of the dead can bring people back to life -- 
in the necropolis when i saw him - alive ... walking he called me anck- su - namun . and then in mister burns ' quarters he tried to kiss me . 
and you think this justifies killing innocent people ! ? 
what is he doing here ? 
see the cartouche there it 's the official royal seal of seti the first i 'm sure of it . 
you put up with me because i can read and write ancient egyptian decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic and i 'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library . 
i 'm sorry it was an accident . 
do you realize we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years . 
what are you doing here ? 
yes and if you cut him down we will give you ten percent . 
i would never ! 
three hundred pounds ! 
two hundred pounds . 
i will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life . 
i am an english woman . 
where are they taking him ? 
and what did he say ? 
and what is he in prison for ? 
yes i know and i 'd like to keep them . 
i have no choice . 
got it ! 
i think you were jealous 
you called me your girl ? 
the creature ! ? are you sure ! ? 
i 'm staying . 
that 's what i am to you ? a contract ? 
it 's everybody 's problem ! 
according to that book once this creature has been reborn his curse will spread and as he grows in strength so will his curse grow infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed . 
then we 'll have to find some immortal ones . 
alright then me i ... i read the book i woke him up and i intend to stop him . 
no we are not . we woke him up and we must try and stop him . 
no we are not . 
having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking - talking corpse tends to convert one . 
it 's just a book no harm ever came from a book . 
yes they never used it because they feared it so . it 's written that if a victim of the hom - dai should ever arise he would bring with him the ten plagues of egypt . 
according to my readings our friend suffered the hom - dai the worst of all ancient egyptian curses one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers . in all of my research i 've never read of this curse actually having been performed . 
very slowly . 
no . i 've never seen a mummy look like this . he 's he 's still ... 
oh my god i 've dreamed about this ever since i was a little girl . 
no ... why ? ... should i ? 
why would i do that ? 
i 'm not ? 
i 'm going to kiss you mister o'connell . 
i may not be an explorer or an adventurer or a treasure hunter or a gunfighter ! mister o'connell but i 'm proud of what i am . 
egypt is in my blood . my father was a famous explorer he loved egypt so much that he married an egyptian . my mother ! who was quite an adventurer herself 
i know you 're wondering what 's a place like me doing in a girl like this ? 
no . i believe if i can see it and i can touch it then it 's real . that 's what i believe . 
you two ! 
a key ! that 's it ! that 's what he was talking about . 
quarried granite with a cobalt lining . 
they did n't they buried him at the foot of anubis . he was either someone of great importance . or he did something very naughty . 
oh my god ... it looks like it looks like a sarcophagus . 
you two are worse than a couple of schoolboys . 
for entering the afterlife . 
oh my god it 's a preparation room . 
ancient egyptian trick . you 'll see . 
according to bembridge scholars inside the statue of anubis was a secret compartment perhaps containing the book of the living . 
for what ? 
are you sure ? 
well of course i can swim if the occasion calls for it . 
oh that 's comforting . 
you know your history . 
i do n't believe in fairy tales and hokum mister o'connell but i do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there the book of the living . it 's what first interested me in egypt as a child . it 's why i came here sort of a life 's pursuit . 
yes i 'm hoping to find a certain artifact a book actually my brother thinks there 's treasure . what do you think is out there ? 
did i miss something ? are we going into battle ? 
if you call that a kiss . 
the only thing that scares me mister o'connell are your manners . 
twenty - five percent and not one single farthing more . 
could you tell me how to get there ? the exact location ? 
what did you find ? what did you see ? 
no i mean -- 
you swear ? 
yes well ...   i know my brother . 
you were actually at hamunaptra ? 
how do you know the box pertains to hamunaptra ? 
we uh ... found ... your puzzle box and we 've come to ask you about it . 
broad ? ! 
ah ! ah ! ahmenophus ! 
what 's it look like ! ? 
finish the inscription idiot ! 
read the inscription on the cover ! 
shut - up and get me off of here ! 
yes . he 's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing . 
well neither do i thank you . 
i ca n't believe i allowed the two of you to get me drunk . 
what do you suppose killed him ? 
it 's called mummification . you 're dead when they do this 
according to my calculations we should be right under the statue . we 'll come up right between his legs .   oh my . 
after all you rode us night and day to win that bet . 
personally i think he 's filthy rude and a complete scoundrel . i do n't like him one bit . 
do you really think he 'll show up ? 
but he 's just a filthy criminal ? 
you stole it from a drunk at the local casbah ? ! 
i 'm your sister . 
you lied to me ! 
you told me you found it on a dig down in thebes ! 
all we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2134 b.c. 
yes . the city of the dead . where the early pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of egypt . 
he was the last pharaoh of the old kingdom said to be the wealthiest pharaoh of them all . 
i think you found something . 
oh no not another worthless trinket jonathan if i bring one more piece of junk to the curator to try and sell for you . 
well i wish you 'd do it sooner rather than later before you ruin my career the way you 've ruined yours . 
have you no respect for the dead ? 
you ... ! you ... ! 
stay away ! 
i 'd better go . 
i 'm not that kind of girl . 
who 's the artist ? 
just wanted to ... powder my nose . 
sure -- i guess . 
just a waitress . 
roy ... we might never see each other again so i 'd better tell you now ... i think you 're wonderful . 
then at least i will have died trying right ? 
just shut up and listen . hold off the attack as long as you can . if i can discover the location i 'll call you -- 
listen casanova may be a supervillain but he 's got a weakness and i 'm it . maybe -- just maybe -- i can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing . 
i 'm going inside . 
at the frankenstein center . 
it 's me . 
that 's what i mean ... ' night roy . 
you know what ? underneath all that anger i think there 's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him . 
you do n't seem very angry right now . 
champion 's going to bounce back and i want to be here when it does . 
i 've thought of leaving going to chicago or new york but ... 
me too ... i love this stupid old town . it 's noisy . it 's smelly . it 's falling apart . 
have you always lived here ? 
what 's your real name ? 
i 've never been able to figure out what to do with my life which is why i guess i 'm still a waitress . 
who would n't ? 
most people just want to make money or be famous or something . but you risk everything just to help people . 
being a superhero wanting to save the world . it 's so ... unselfish . 
i admire you . 
that was easy . 
i get off work in fifteen minutes . walk me home ? 
alone tonight ? 
not tonight . 
i guess ... are you always so angry ? 
maybe you guys ought to forget this superhero stuff and join kiwanis or something . 
here you go . 
so what can i get you ? 
so you 're like ... struggling superheroes ? 
are you famous ? 
really ? like captain amazing ? 
you guys going to a costume party ? 
please sir come into bed or i shall die of a chill . 
lisette la croix . 
br - rrr these sheets are like ice . 
do you have three francs sir ? 
would you like to take me there so that we can get warm sir ? 
is it a nice warm room sir ? 
are you staying with a friend sir ? 
one must take life as it comes -- do you live in lyon sir ? 
well one must do something to live you know -- and i have an elderly mother who depends on me . 
yes i am sir . 
yes it must be . 
the weather is terrible is n't it sir ? 
good evening sir . 
ah well my dear madame de montesquiou peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness . 
ah that is good . 
oh ... i see .   i understand .   how is ... the emperor ? 
ah my dear madame de montesquiou you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child at last .   i was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the empress . 
oh -- i did n't tell you ... i 've seen dr. corvisart and he was very reassuring and encouraging .   he has had excellent results with the waters of plombiers and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there . apparently he sent madame le floch there last year and she gave birth to twins . 
oh my darling .   i 'm sorry too .   i wo n't do that again -- whatever you do .   i wo n't cause you any more embarrassment i promise . 
who is it ? 
in case of a ... surprise attack ... at night ... i am such a ... light sleeper ... i could wake you ... i could scream . 
but you will not ... be safe ... 
separate bedrooms ? 
five minutes . 
five minutes . 
will you be joining us soon ? 
what are you doing in there ? 
where is madame trillaud ? 
i know what you 're doing in there . 
open the door .   it 's me . 
you are my old friend . 
perhaps -- but tell me you promise anyway . 
i do n't care but promise you will never leave me . 
promise me . 
promise me you will never leave me . 
she must have been in love with you . 
were any of them married ? 
were any of them prettier than i am ? 
were they pretty ? 
were you in love with any of them ? 
but you have had mistresses while you were away . 
and you are you in love with any one else ? 
now i know that i shall die if you leave me . 
i thought i was .   i was confused . 
oh you must forgive me general bonaparte i 'm afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but i know absolutely nothing about this . eugene is so independent -- he hardly tells me anything any more and he has so many things in his room i must confess i was n't even aware that he had this sword -- you know how boys can be ! 
oh ... how very nice of you to bring that for eugene ... did general de beauharnais give it to you ? 
yes i 'm afraid he is .   i believe he is riding .   i know he 'll be heartbroken to have missed you . 
yes of course .   hortense darling will you tell louise to bring some sherry ? 
oh it 's not the slightest inconvenience general bonaparte . it is an honor to have you here . 
may i offer you a drink ? 
oh ... yes of course !   have you met my daughter hortense ? 
ah how nice to meet you general bonaparte .   one has read so much about you lately .   please sit down . 
papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me . 
oh no i am very happy .   but you must have patience with me ... i know nothing at all of what a wife must know .   and i know nothing about men . my papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender . 
will it be possible to have my dog bijou sent here ?   i was not allowed to bring her and i love her so much . 
i hope you have patience with me .   i do not know how to dance the quadrille but if you desire it i will learn . 
i am told that fontainebleau has many lovely views .   i know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside . 
you are so good to me .   will you also allow me to have a botanical garden ? 
will i be able to play the harp ?   it is an instrument of which i am very fond . 
do you like music ? 
you are much younger and much more handsome than your pictures . 
and where did you see my portrait ? 
oh then you are ... 
you alright ? 
next time page me first . 
so what ?   let 's make'em wait . 
it 's locked . 
easier said than done .   we saved up to get away from them but they followed us . 
thanks for noticing .   it used ta be peaceful before they got out .   took over the house and caused my mother 's nervous breakdown . 
you did all this for me ? 
what ? ?   so you snuck in my room to tell me that ? 
what are you doing here ? 
better sooner than later . 
i just wanted to give you this . 
i 'm sorry for what my brother did this morning .   they 're assholes . 
hello remember me ? 
i do n't know . 
my brothers wo n't give me a ride . 
to the cucamonga shopping center . 
' take your car ? ' 
are you going to take me to see mom ? 
hey what 's going on ?

i thought you were taking me to see mama ? 
you sent my assistant on an errand . 
but i want to make some changes . get krista in here right away wo n't you ? 
all right i 'll do it . 
truth is besides the headache i 've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc . make my apologies . 
nothing . i broke a lamp . 
do n't remind me . 
what 's he doing here ? 
lousy . and i have siesta hair . i 'm thinking of canceling the speech . 
good luck . 
of course . i 'll get a car to drive you . 
for not believing you . 
i would also like to apologize . 
i ... 1 would like to ... thank you mister wat ... gene . 
i love it when pistolero 's talk of trust . 
i 'd prefer we did n't refer to it as my last speech . 
i said i 'd listen to you not necessarily believe you . you 're telling me my people are in a plot against me . you 're telling me my husband wants me killed . what do you expect ? 
what the hell are you saying ? 
who did ? 
you shot her ? 
how do you know that ? 
you were very nervous . 
i remember you ... in the elevator . 
that's ... a comfort to hear . 
one loud scream will bring them in here instantly . you wo n't get very far . think it over . 
my security people are right next door . 
of course .   i wish everything were that easy . 
you were saying ?   your daughter .... ? 
what can i do for you mr .... watson ?

proof he 's declawed . as for him we buried him good and deep . 
bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go . found him in an old boiler room just like before . saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore drunk an ' asleep with his weird knives by his side ... 
oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place and fred krueger was free just like that . 
your father the cop . that 's a good one .   forget fred krueger . you do n't want to know believe me . 
dead and gone . 
put that damned thing down ! 
but that 's just not reality nancy ! 
i threw that filthy thing away -- i do n't know what you 're trying to prove with it but -- 
i do n't think you 're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee ! 
okay ... you need anything just call . 
you okay ? 
take this it 'll help you sleep . 
and no school tomorrow either . you take a little vacation relax and rest for a change . 
no television forget the homework no phone calls . 
to bed with you c'm on . 
you okay ? 
it happens all the time .   i 've got some warm milk all ready for you . why do n't you jump into bed ?   i 'm gon na turn on your electric blanket too . c'm on now . 
you 're not falling asleep are you ? you could drown you know . 
get into bed . 
nancy do n't fall asleep in there . 
right home after . 
did you sleep ? 
i could hear you tossing and turning all night kiddo . you 've no business going to school . 
where you think you 're going ? 
maybe you do n't think murder 's serious -- 
apparently he was crazy jealous . nancy said they 'd had a fight rod and tina . 
meanwhile whatever you do do n't fall asleep . midnight . 
you 're a jock . you must have a baseball bat or something . come to my window at midnight . and meanwhile ... 
you heard me . i grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up . we both come out you cold cock the fucker and we got him . clever huh ? 
good then you wo n't mind cold - cocking this guy when i bring him out . 
if i ca n't then you all can relax because it 'll just be a simple case of me being nuts . 
just like i did the hat . have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up . 
my dream . 
do n't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when i bring him out . 
yeah and if he gets me i 'm pretty sure you 're next . 
the killer . 
coming up on the seventh day . it 's okay i checked guiness . the record 's eleven and i 'll beat that if i have to .   listen i ... i know who he is . 
much better . 
i found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on ventura . 
what happens if they do n't do that ? 
and what if they meet a monster in their dream ? then what ? 
and if you ca n't do that you sleep . 
just checking -- keep out of sight ! 
shhh . now listen here 's what we 're gon na do ... 
it 's nothing too hard or anything .   i 'm just going to ... look for someone and ... i want you to be sort of a ... guard . okay ? 
listen i got a crazy favor to ask . 
you believe in anything ? 
you believe in the boogey man ? 
well at least i have an objective wall to bounce this off .   you believe it 's possible to dream about what 's going to happen ? 
m'god i look twenty years old .   you have any weird dreams last night ? 
not really . 
guess i did . 
sometimes i wish you did n't live right across the street . 
yeah . something slippery all over here ...   tina ? 
oh -- jeez -- glen ! rod 's gone ape ! 
because he was scary that 's why . 
glen . not now . i mean we 're here for tina now not for ourselves . 
then bring us back its tail and whiskers . 
worked like a charm . 
dad ! get us outta here ! 
and you 'll be here to catch him right ? 
that 'll be exactly half past midnight . time for me to fall asleep and find him . 
-- i want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that ? 
fred krueger did it daddy and only i can get him . it 's my nightmare he comes to . 
please . i 'm gon na go get the guy who did it and bring him to you . i just need you be right there to arrest him . okay ? 
i 've got a proposition for you . listen very carefully please . 
you know he 's dead though right ? 
hi daddy . i know what happened . 
dad -- what you doing here ? 
you do n't know he did it . 
just want to talk to him a second . 
dad i want to see rod lane . 
you used me daddy ! 
she had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her last night . that 's why we were there ; she was afraid to sleep alone . 
she dreamed this would happen ... 
rod 's not a lunatic . 
okay . hi dad . 
feeling better ? 
just sleep now mom . 
give me the key mother . 
all these years you 've kept those things buried down here ? in our own house ? 
go on ... 
so he 's alive ? 
i do want to know . he 's not dead and gone -- he 's after me and if i sleep he 'll get me ! i 've got to know ! 
i want to know how where -- if you do n't tell me i 'm going to call daddy . 
mom i want to know what you know about fred krueger . 
what 's with the bars ? 
screw sleep ! 
it 's real mamma . feel it . 
what i learned at the dream clinic that 's what i 'm trying to prove . rod did n't kill tina and he did n't hang himself . it 's this guy -- he 's after us in our dreams . 
did you ask daddy to have the hat examined ? 
go even crazier ? 
yeah . just had a little dream . i 'm falling right back to sleep . 
i must be going nuts ... 
yes mother . g'night . 
no mother . yes mother . no mother . 
warm milk . gross . 
mother for petesakes . 
i will . 
i wo n't . 
right home after . see you . 
i 'll sleep in study hall promise . i 'd rather keep busy you know ? 
it was n't that serious ... 
what you mean ' all at once ' ? 
well then how can you say somebody else was there ? 
how could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it ? 
and then what happened ? 
the door was locked from your side . 
you were screaming like crazy . 
nobody 's gon na kill you . 
he does n't know you .   could n't you change ? 
we should get her out of here ... 
i dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater ; i dream in color y'know ; he walked into the room i was in right right through the wall like it was smoke or something and just stared at me . sort of ... obscenely . then he walked out through the wall on the other side . like he 'd just come to check me out ... 
maybe we should call rod have him come over too . he might get jealous . 
nice to have a fire . 
right . well she did n't exactly ... 
forget it the point is everybody has nightmares once in a while . no biggy . 
he 's nuts about you . 
from leon . 
it 's from paris . 
bring me forty - five back . 
well here are fifty francs . 
have you any money ? 
you can have it for good . it is my wedding present . 
you want this ? 
what is it anna ? 
you feel it though . 
well sometimes they 're not completely covered but ... they do n't freeze . 
no my dear it is true . that 's how they live in the other world . here we dress to have our bodies covered ... to keep warm .... 
when you get up you put on a negligee and then you change to a morning frock . 
a dress you wear in the evening . 
an evening gown . 
it was very silly .... i would be ashamed to wear it here . 
well a hat ... 
no i left everything in paris . i just happened to be wearing this . 
thank you anna . i 'll dry it up here when i wash it next . i should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear . 
i see . 
i have nothing to hide . 
i have n't talked to anyone about paris . i have n't said a word . 
about what ? 
you should be more careful anna . 
well i 've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we 'll manage . 
an omelet . 
a few friends ... just a little dinner party . 
too bad ... you missed an inspiring day anna . 
are n't you late ? 
good evening anna . 
who gave you this idea ? what is responsible for all this ? 
i do n't know how i can get you out of it this time . how will it end ? what will happen to you ? 
friends ... friends buljanoff iranoff ... 
is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment ? i must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account . 
but comrades ... 
do n't forget the day will come when you will have to face razinin . 
i must be stern with you . 
do n't worry ... there will be enough . 
let 's not close our eyes . there are many good things to see here too . 
now let 's forget everything except that we 're together . 
huh ? ... why do n't you get a haircut buljanoff ? you all look so wintry comrades . and why do we always keep the windows closed ?   is n't it amazing at home there 's still snow and ice and here ... look at the birds . i always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries . now i know why . we have the high ideal but they have the climate ... well comrades i do n't think i need you any more . 
you might get me an accurate map of paris . i want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city . 
do you spell buljanoff with one or two f 's ? 
comrade buljanoff ... 
you did n't get legal advice ? 
which part of the room is mine ? 
very good . the last mass trials were a great success . there are going to be fewer but better russians . 
you mean you are deserting russia ? 
you 've done it again and i am responsible . how can you forget yourselves this way ? you were sent here to make money not to spend it . 
but buljanoff iranoff kopalski ... 
look for yourselves . 
only myself and two other girls . one is a cello player in the opera and the other a street - car conductor . 
come now you must not talk that way .... you have to adjust yourselves .... we must be brave . 
well it means another two weeks in paris . 
two thousand francs . if i stay here a week i will cost the russian people seven cows .   who am i to cost the russian people seven cows ? 
do you know how much a cow costs comrade iranoff ? 
a week ? 
how much does this cost ? 
i am nina ivanovna yakushova envoy extraordinary acting under direct orders of comrade commissar razinin . present me to your colleagues . 
i am looking for michael simonovitch iranoff . 
do n't make it difficult for me . this is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you . 
we will get that ... we 'll get everything ... maybe a little bit later but we 'll get it ... we must be patient ... finally we got the spring did n't we ? we got the swallows and you will get your apfel strudel too . 
now comrades ... there is something better in life than crumbs of french pastry . 
the same spring we had in paris . just as good . 
and it 's great ! think what it was a few years ago and what it is now . 
sssh ! once and for all we 're in moscow ! 
how are you you three scoundrels ? 
no not a thing . would you like to go out ? 
oh yes power and light . thank you . 
you comrade iranoff go to the public library and get me the section of the civil code on property . 
we can not feed the russian people on your intentions . fifty per cent to a so - called duchess ! ... half of every loaf of bread to our enemy ! comrade kopalski go at once to our embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in paris . 
will you send me some cigarettes please ?   comrades i am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the state .   you were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry . why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time ? our next year 's crop is in danger and you know it . unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people . and you three comrades ... 
i will not repeat your mistake . i will have no dealings with the grand duchess nor her representative . 
i hope so for your sake .   let us examine the case . what does the lawyer say ? 
i am ashamed to put the picture of lenin in a room like this .   comrades your telegram was received with great disfavor in moscow . 
what 's that ? 
no thank you . 
why ? ... why should you carry other people 's bags ? 
do n't make an issue of my womanhood . we are here for work ... all of us . let 's not waste time . shall we go ? 
au revoir . 
well there 's nothing we can do about it . why get excited ? 
i know gentlemen but it is in the hands of the court . we 're helpless are n't we ? 
that 's two weeks from thursday ... 
i 'm sorry gentlemen . the other day i heard such a funny story ...   it still makes me laugh . it is very funny .   i am sorry . oh yes ... about this injunction ... 
well when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country how can i waver ? no one shall say ninotchka was a bad russian . 
but leon i am only here for a few days . 
so -- you 're behind all this . i should have known . 
so happy and so tired . 
comrades ! people of the world ! the revolution is on the march ... i know ... wars will wash over us ... bombs will fall ... all civilization will crumble ... but not yet please ... wait wait ... what 's the hurry ?   let us be happy ... give us our moment ....   we are happy are n't we leon ? 
thank you leon ... thank you masses .   can i make a speech now ? 
is this the wish of the masses ? 
they belong to the people . 
czar peter gave it to his wife catherine the great . for it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market . 
... they are the tears of old russia ... see that stone ? 
it would n't be fair to the man in the street .   there they are ... they are terrible things those jewels .... 
there it is ... thursday ... you ca n't rip it out of the week .... 
no music . 
it 's dead . 
well then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven ... 
no no news . we do n't want to know what 's happening in the world . we want to be left alone do n't we ? 
oh yes yes . it has a little knob that turns ... a little knob ... it must be somewhere around here ... yes ... here ... i see ... 
radio ! what is radio ? 
i have paid the penalty . now let 's have some music . 
much happier . 
everyone wants to confess and if they do n't confess they make them confess . i am a traitor . when i kissed you i betrayed the russian ideal . leon i should be stood up against the wall . 
i am so happy . no one can be so happy without being punished . i will be punished and i should be punished .   i want to confess darling . 
our salute will be a kiss . 
... and we wo n't clench our fist ... 
and we wo n't stretch up our arms ... 
no do n't let 's have it any color ... no color ... just a house house ... let 's form our own party . 
not white darling . 
are we going to build our little house ? 
do n't tell them where we 're going sweetheart . 
i love you my little leonitchka ! 
no speech ? 
they are all duchesses here ... thousands of duchesses ... and i am going to tell them . 
comrades ! good people of france ! 
do n't shush me . i am people ! i want to make a speech . i want to overthrow the duchess ! 
i must talk to my brothers ! 
comrades ! comrades ! 
oh everything is so wonderful ! it 's getting farther and farther away ! 
oo ! darling ! something is the matter . 
to the loveliest story i ever heard . 
wonderful -- if one could believe it . 
go on . 
you never finished the one about the two scotchmen with the names . 
quickly please ... tell me one of your funny stories . 
how do you do ? 
from what i read i thought champagne was a strong drink . it 's very delicate . do people ever get drunk on this ? 
it 's funny to look back . i was brought up on goat 's milk i had a ration of vodka in the army and now champagne . 
i would n't know . the closest i ever came to champagne was in a newsreel . the wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship . 
leon do n't ever ask me for a picture of myself ... i could n't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer ... i could n't breathe i could n't stand it . 
i suppose she is very entertaining ... it must be lots of fun to be with her so witty so glamorous ... 
she is very attractive . she has great elegance .   she 's what you call a woman of the world is n't she ? 
when i was here before i noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame . i thought what a waste of silver . that 's all that interested me then . now i would like to know ... what happened to the woman ? 
did you make any change in this room ? 
if you do n't want to answer you need n't . but if you do you must tell me the truth . 
leon i would like to ask you something . 
leon i want to tell you something which i thought i never would say which i thought nobody ever should say because i thought it did n't exist ... and leon ... i ca n't say it ... 
leon you know the jokes you told me a few days ago ? i wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them . now leon that 's wrong . i know they 're not funny they 're silly . they 're stupid . and still ... i laugh ... and when i look at buljanoff and iranoff and kopalski i know they are scoundrels and i should hate them -- then i realize who made them like that and instead of sending my report to moscow i tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat ... and if this keeps on ... am i too talkative ? 
not radio . let 's have music that 's just for ourselves . 
well first i should like to take off my hat and jacket .   then could we have some music ? 
it 's nine o'clock . 
for twelve francs seventy - five . 
i do n't look too foolish ? 
i do n't think so . 
i wish they had never met . 
i have never heard one . 
probably not . 
on which boat ? 
ha ! ha ! now go back . 
then you should go back to your table . 
at what ? 
but you have now and i know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in russia would be punished by death . 
your tactics are useless . my name is neither buljanoff iranoff nor kopalski . 
what are you after ? 
this is a place for workmen . 
then how did you get here ? 
i do n't like your following me . 
send me a plate of raw carrots and beets beets predominating on a ratio of sixty - forty ... what ? there is a strike in the kitchen ? good ! will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause . i hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables ... what ? you wo n't serve me either ? now look here comrade i think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you 're weakening the people . 
i kissed the polish lancer too ... before he died . 
then do it through my lawyer ! 
it is out of the question . if you wish to approach me ... 
as a representative of moscow ... 
i was sent here by my country to fight you . 
let 's forget that we ever met . 
i must go . 
but one of your friends may be in need of you . you must answer . 
the telephone is ringing . 
thank you . 
no that was restful . again . 
it 's false sentimentality . 
that 's the way a clock works . there 's nothing wonderful about it . you merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration . 
it 's twelve o'clock . 
just what you see . a tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution . 
do n't pity me . pity the polish lancer . after all i 'm alive . 
a polish lancer . i was sixteen . 
i was a sergeant in the third cavalry brigade . would you like to see my wound ? 
i was wounded before warsaw . 
it 's never too late to change . i used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself . my father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm but i preferred the bayonet . 
do n't do it please . 
you repeat yourself . 
you do n't have to do a thing . chemically we are already quite sympathetic . 
i acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all . 
you are bringing in wrong values . love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological or shall we say chemical process . a lot of nonsense is talked and written about it . 
look at me . the whites of your eyes are clear . your cornea is excellent . 
your general appearance is not distasteful . 
that is correct . 
you pronounce it incorrectly . ni- notchka . 
that is why i believe in the future of my country . 
you are something we do not have in russia . 
and what do you do for mankind ? 
and what is your profession ? 
i will start with you . 
i should say this room is eighteen by twenty - five . 
is that customary ? 
what do we do now ? 
thank you . i 've had all the calories necessary for today . 
the day will come when you will be free . go to bed little father . we want to be alone . 
he looks sad . do you whip him ? 
good evening comrade .   this man is horribly old . you should not make him work . 
then why do n't we go ?   you might be an interesting subject of study . 
then you do n't want me to go there . 
does that mean that you want me to go there ? 
so that is your house ? 
i see a house that looks like any other house . what 's remarkable about it ? 
i do not deny its beauty but it is a waste of electricity . 
do not misunderstand me . i do not hold your frivolity against you .   as basic material you might not be bad but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture . i feel sorry for you . 
yes it is . 
you gave me some very valuable information . thank you . 
that 's a strange angle . 
go ahead . 
your type will soon be extinct . 
i have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society . it is having a superior earning power that makes you like that . 
you are very sure of yourself are n't you ? 
for my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale ? 
suppress it . 
i am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points . must you flirt ? 
and where are we ? 
why do you need my finger ? 
how long does it take a man to land ? 
i am interested in the eiffel tower from a technical standpoint . 
no ... i am looking for the eiffel tower . 
correct me if i am wrong ... we are facing north are n't we ? 
you might hold this for me . 
thank you . 
in other words you do n't know . 
have you never been caught in a similar situation ? 
how many minutes between the first and second whistle ? 
at what intervals does he whistle ? 
how long do we have to wait here ? 
yes . could you give me some information ? 
you please . 
that 's not the way to win him back ... not leon . 
go on . 
i see . you have calculated in terms of hunger . 
wo n't those two years in court be expensive for you ? i know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people but now ... 
under soviet law the jewels belong to the state . france is going to uphold that ownership . 
in other words moral ideas have no weight with you ... all right then let 's deal with legal facts . you know that france has recognized the soviet . 
they always belonged to the russian people . they were paid for with their sweat their blood their lives and you will give them back ! 
i will have to face the consequences but so will you . do n't forget they will ask how you got them . 
you leave me no choice . 
where are they ? 
where are they ? 
i told you to go madame . 
in that case i can only say good - by . 
i must insist that you leave . 
it is not enough to be witty madame . people grow tired of being entertained . you made that mistake before . problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony . 
people can not be taken away madame neither a hundred and sixty million nor one . not if you have their love . you had n't . that 's why you 're not in russia any longer and that 's why you came here this morning . 
if this is meant to be a joke it is not funny . or do you still think you 're issuing orders from your palace in petrograd ? 
madame if you ... 
i must ask you to leave . 
we have nothing to discuss . 
please come to the point . what is it you want ? 
if you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night i am afraid you misunderstood my attitude . 
i think we can cut your visit short . leon is not here . 
you 're right madame it will all be over by thursday . 
exactly . you see it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low - cut gowns in the old russia . the lashes of the cossacks across our backs were not very becoming and you know how vain women are . 
not at all .... i understand perfectly count d'algout gave you a dog . you made it very clear madame . 
that 's no business ... that 's a social injustice . 
what do you want ? 
i will do my best . 
how can i make myself clear ... it is difficult to express but i 'd rather not go to foreign countries any more . please comrade ... let me stay here ... let me finish my work ... i am in the rhythm of it now ... i do n't want to go away . i do n't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again . it throws one out of gear .... let me finish my work ... i have concentrated everything in it ... please ... do n't make me go . 
i am sorry i do n't want to overstep my position -- but please ... do n't send me . 
i appreciate the confidence you show in me but i must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission . i should hate to interrupt my present work . i am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne . 
you want me to go to constantinople ? 
oh they should n't do such things . are you sure this report is correct ? 
may i ask what has happened ? 
thank you . 
may i ask why ? 
i need very little sleep . we must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange . i have already started a survey of our most urgent needs . 
yes it does . 
good morning comrade commissar . here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months . 
the future of the common people . 
bring me something simple . i never think about food . 
raw carrots and beets . 
this will do . 
where is it ? 
where is that ? 
where do you eat ? 
can you recommend a restaurant ? 
just for the honeymoon . 
you know i told you that pavlov and i are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers . would it be asking too much ... 
ninotchka i would n't bring this up if we were n't such good friends . 
they must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft ... something you do n't even see . 
and there ? 
now ninotchka you 're exaggerating . 
you mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day ? 
what do you wear in the morning ? 
evening gown ? 
as beautiful as that ? what else ? come tell me . 
what was it like ? 
tell me ... what else did you have ? 
ninotchka you know i am your friend you can trust me .... did you bring back anything else ? 
you know how it is today ... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter - revolution . 
when i passed through the laundry yard today i saw all the women huddled around this so i brought it up here . things like this create a bad feeling . first they did n't know whose it was . then they saw the paris label and did it start a commotion ! some said it 's what we all ought to wear and others said it 's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline . it undermines our whole cause . 
you should . i 'll show you . 
that 's just it . it makes people feel queer . i do nt ' want you to get in any trouble . 
ever since you have been back from paris ... 
and you too ninotchka . 
i 'll tell you later .   that gurganov you never know whether he 's on his way to the washroom or the secret police . 
it just goes to prove the theory of our state . if you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you 're true to the collective spirit and stick together you 've got an omelet .   that reminds me ... have you heard the latest they 're telling about the kremlin ? 
an omelet ! are n't you living a little above your ration ? 
what are you serving ? 
i know ... my heart is sad ... but my feet are happy . when all the tanks and guns were roaring over the red square i sat here all by myself and played a beethoven sonata . not bad at all .   are you expecting someone ? 
no the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade . 
good evening ninotchka . 
blue ? let 's offset his mood . find a striped one and brighten it with a great blaze of tie . 
nonsense . how can you fight the reds and make yourself agreeable to the whites if you do n't keep up your strength . 
that 's all right . 
good morning gaston . 
general would you mind making my excuses at our table ? i 'll be back in a few moments . 
you 're looking magnificent leon ...   ... is n't he general savitzky ? 
general please ... if you hear any rumors that i am a charitable person will you please kill them at their source ? 
are they indeed ? thank you . 
yes general savitzky ? 
thank you louis . 
that 's perfect ! 
count d'algout ... 
good evening louis . you seem to be very crowded tonight . can you manage a table near the floor ? 
just in case they do n't give you your visa to russia i want you to know that i have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the touraine and if you feel the need of a change ... 
count d'algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him i 'll be delighted . 
after our talk last night i took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning . knowing how difficult it is to get into soviet russia i thought i might be of some assistance to you .   may i introduce myself ? i am the duchess swana of russia ... another russia . 
hello leon darling ! 
she 's gone leon . 
knowing the efficiency of the french air service i think i can guarantee that madame yakushova has already taken off for moscow . 
the same old trouble leon . you 're always late . whether you 're taking me to the opera or calling for me at a beauty shop you 're never on time . and now when it 's a question of your reform -- late again .   by about five minutes . 
leon ! this has the ugly sound of regeneration . 
say it over and over again leon . words are a wonderful safety valve and that 's what you need -- because you know it 's impossible do n't you ? 
and i thought it was something serious ! how could you frighten me so ? 
brutal frankness if you insist . 
all right i 'll listen . 
oh no my little volga boatman . have you forgotten our first commandment : never complain -- never explain . it has worked so often and so perfectly do n't let 's break the rule . and please do n't look so guilty otherwise i 'll ... 
is this by any chance going to be a confession ? 
did i act stupidly last night ? should i apologize ? 
leon darling how nice ! have you ordered tea or a cocktail ? 
a very wise suggestion leon . i 'm afraid madame and i will never agree .   the only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week . i understand everything will be over by thursday . am i right ? 
i 'm going leon ...   but before i leave i must compliment you on your gown madame yakushova . is that what they 're wearing in moscow this year ? 
poor madame yakushova ... here we are talking in mysteries .... i 'm sure you wonder what it 's all about . 
he won another blue ribbon and bit the judge . ha ! ha ! ha ! i bought him the cutest sweater as a reward . you should see him strut down the street in it . he looks like a little boulevardier .   you see count d'algout gave me punchy for my birthday .   you must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as punchy did n't you leon ? 
i 've some wonderful news for you leon . it 's about punchy ... do you mind if i sit down ? 
how do you do ? 
am i interrupting ? 
it 's a dream of beauty . he never takes my word for anything but i was right was n't i ? 
did n't i tell you benson and benson were the tailors for you ? 
is this your new dress suit ? 
now darling soak in your beautiful pine bath and let gaston shave you . 
you saw all that in one glimpse ? 
that bad ?   old or young ? 
imagine the carpets of a self- respecting parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik ! what does she look like ? 
you just told me you had n't seen her . 
that proletarian ! in the old days we 'd have had her flogged . 
you have n't seen her yet ? 
now ... here we have two very handsome soft - boiled eggs . do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs ? probably not . they have such unfeeling eyes . we 'll put in a great nugget of butter plenty of pepper and salt ... darling i have n't seen you for three livelong days ... seventy - two hours ! 
not in your condition .   make it tepid gaston ... tepid and tender . and lay out his gray suit .   afterwards i 'll drive you through the bois . slowly ... in waltz time . 
darling you 're taking my business affairs far too seriously . much as i 'd love to rob the bolsheviks of their filthy money i wo n't do it at the expense of your health . particularly as we know we wo n't get much .   you look so pale ... pale but interesting . 
do n't tell me the bed has lost its best friend . 
is anything wrong ? are you ill ? 
leon ! what in heaven 's name ... ! 
it looks pretty hopeless ... there may be a chance ... that 's all ... the french government has recognized soviet russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake . he might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money money money ! ... that 's all they are interested in -- those lawyers ! 
shhh !   ... but how can there be a question ? ... are you my lawyer or theirs ? ... all right i 'll let you know ! 
this is the duchess swana ... i want to speak to monsieur cornillon ... it 's very important ... please get him right away ... hello monsieur cornillon ? the most incredible thing has happened ! my jewels are here in paris ! three bolshevik swine are trying to sell them ! yes ... yes ... we must act immediately ! ... call the police ... have them arrested ! ... well then get an injunction ! ... but do something monsieur cornillon !   ... but they are my jewels ! there must be some way of getting them back ! 
rakonin bless him has given me the most amazing news ! 
tell him i wo n't be able to see him for a half an hour . 
he 's a waiter at the clarence poor devil . you know him . 
was i ? no ... not by a bolshevik ! 
a couple of bloodhounds and we have uncle tom 's cabin . 
first tell me are you my little volga boatman ? 
my little volga boatman ! stop threatening ! i do n't deserve this .   are you my little volga boatman ? 
imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou ! think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages ! i can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments ! 
was it for this that i refused to endorse dr. bertrand 's mouthwash ? i could have made a little fortune by saying that the vincent vacuum cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the romanoffs ... and now you want them to smear my life 's secrets over the front page of a tabloid ? 
oh leon ! 
what a gruesome proof of the power of the press ! 
those newspaper people ? 
oh leon you are so good to me . 
did you win ? 
do n't you find that restful ? ... why did n't you come last night ? 
it 's really a wretched morning ... wretched . i ca n't get myself right . i wanted to look mellow and i look brittle . my face does n't compose well ... all highlights ... how can i dim myself down leon ? suggest something . i am so bored with this face . i wish i had someone else 's face . whose face would you have if you had your choice ? oh well i guess one gets the face one deserves . 
hello leon ! 
i think i know leon quite as well as you ... possibly a little better . leave that worry to me . five - forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with monsieur mercier but naturally you 'll be too busy for any farewells . i 'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and i will also see you to the airport . that 's my proposition comrade yakushova . 
i am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five - forty plane to moscow . 
no i just wanted to be absolutely impartial . both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years . we can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition . ninotchka now realizes what she is after . 
i may run out of money but you have already run out of bread . two years is a long time for your comrades to wait . 
my lawyer agrees with you . he says france will uphold it in every court but i will drag you through every court do n't forget that . and when i say it will take two years i am as always conservative . 
now let 's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way . our situation has changed considerably . before i had only a claim to the jewels . now i have the jewels . 
i told you we had plenty to talk about . shall we sit down ? 
that 's very simple to answer . they were given to me by my mother . they were given to her by her mother in fact they 're mine you can not steal what belongs to you ! 
wo n't it be rather embarrassing for a soviet envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them ? 
do n't worry . fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open . perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a russian .   i just put this on for sentiment . the rest are absolutely safe . i assure you . but if you feel like notifying the police ... 
you were very careless with our precious jewels my dear . they 're too expensive a toy for two children to play with . 
believe me leon ca n't help you . he does n't know anything about the jewels ... i give you my word ... i swear it . 
i would n't waken leon . after last night i would say not before three o'clock at the earliest . 
not before you agree to use those reservations to moscow . 
you ca n't deny we gave the people their money 's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling romanoffs -- eight ! 
my dear you do n't know how impressive i could be . did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels ? 
very interesting my dear but could n't you write all that from moscow ? a dissertation on love on soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox . 
my palace in petrograd ... yes you took that away from me . you took away my czar my country my people everything i had ...   but nothing more -- i warn you . 
do n't worry . i have already made reservations . it 's perfect flying weather . they assure me there 's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to moscow in no time . 
leave ? that 's exactly what i came here to ask you to do . leave ! i do n't mean this hotel and i do n't mean paris ... i mean france . there 's a plane for moscow at five - forty . 
that 's all right ... i grow on people . 
now there you are completely wrong . if we sit down for a little chat i 'm sure we wo n't run out of conversation and what 's more it wo n't be dull . 
i just dropped in to have a little heart - to - heart talk with you . 
do n't worry you were quite rude enough .   do you mind if i let in a little fresh air and sunshine ? i 'm sure it will make you feel better and i want you to be at your very best . in full possession of your faculties at least . 
how stale last night 's gaiety looks ! it has the taste of a dead cigarette . 
of course not my dear ! i did n't come here with any such suspicion . how ridiculous !   nor did i come here to pick up his hat . 
it is tomorrow morning ... tomorrow noon to be exact . i hope you will forgive me . i know it 's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour . do n't you recognize me ? i am the duchess swana . 
good morning . 
it is unfortunate that you have so few more days in paris .   be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to moscow .   good night .   good night leon . 
you 're absolutely right about the cossacks . we made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts . they had such reliable guns . 
is n't it amazing ! one gets a wrong impression of the new russia .   it must be charming . i 'm glad conditions are so improved . i assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances ? 
dear me ... i must be losing my finesse . if i 'm not careful i 'll be understood by everybody . 
thank you so much my friend . i will get in touch with you . 
alexis ! do you know what you are saying ? 
why do you bring this up after so many years ? 
my jewels ? ! 
what is it rakonin ? did you lose your job ? 
how do you do my friend . 
there 'll be time for that . 
it 'll be over soon . 
no .   they 're not yours .   they are you . you should burn them . 
and what would i find out that i have n't known for years .   what makes it so damn sad is that you could n't confide in any of us . you had to make a record ... for the whole world . 
i remember alger hiss .   i know how ugly you can be -- you 're capable of anything .   but you see it does n't really matter at the end of the day what 's on them .   because you have absolutely no remorse .   no concept of remorse .   you want the tapes to get out you want them to see you at your worst ... 
you do n't expect me to believe that for one minute do you ?   does it matter what 's on them ? really ? ... murder dick ?   sex ?   your secrets your fantasies ?   or just me and you and ... 
what matters to me is whether you understand it . 
why did n't you ? 
thank you ?   dick sometimes i understand why they hate you . 
no it is n't .   i wo n't interfere with you anymore .   i 'm finished trying . 
i 'm the only left dick .   if you do n't talk to me you ... 
whatever it is you 've always been hiding .   you 're letting it destroy you dick .   you wo n't even ask for help .   you 're destroying yourself dick . 
i wish i knew .   you 're hiding . 
you .   what ' you 're doing -- 
ron told me that bob haldeman 's been calling .   but you wo n't talk to him ... if he 's convicted will you pardon him ? 
it 's not the press that matters . nixon 's wife is proud of him . 
congratulations dick . 
you 're a long way from whittier . 
penny for your thoughts . 
but they never will dick .   no matter how many elections you win they never will . 
sometimes i think that 's what you want . 
you personally ? 
they 're all your enemies ? 
then what are you scared of honey ? 
no you 're not .   so stop comparing yourself to him .   you have no reason to ... you have everything you ever wanted . you 've earned it .   why ca n't you just enjoy it ? 
yes it 's been a long time ... 
i was thinking tonight -- do you remember dick ?   do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys ?   you did n't want to let me out of your sight . 
why do n't we go down to key biscayne together ?   just the two of us . 
i 've missed you . 
he looked old did n't he ? 
will you ... would you kiss me ? 
can i just ask for one thing ? 
then i 'll be there for you . 
and then you 'll be happy ? 
do you really want this dick ? 
i do n't want them to love me . 
you should be going ... the primaries are soon are n't they ?   new hampshire ... 
were you planning to tell me ? 
they 've lost a brother .   you know what that means dick . 
then call him .   i 'm sure it was an oversight . 
you do n't have to go . 
dick you should call bobby . 
is that the truth ? 
are you serious ? 
we can be happy .   we really can .   we love you dick .   the girls and i ... 
dick do n't ... 
that 's what you said the first time we met .   you did n't even know me . 
no i 'm not !   i 'm finished . 
you 're ruining us .   if we stay with you you 'll take us down with you .   this is n't political dick .   this is our life . 
the girls will grow up .   they only know you from television anyway . 
i want a divorce . 
not that .   us . 
it 's over dick . 
no .   i 'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again . 
i suppose castro staged the whole thing just to beat you . 
you 're not going to blame this on castro are you ? 
you 're not a failure dick . 
it is .   we know that .   and it 's enough that we know .   just think of the girls .   they 're still young .   we never see them .   i lost my parents .   i do n't want them to lose theirs ; i do n't want them to grow up without a mother and father ... 
we do n't have to put ourselves through this again dick . 
it makes us human ... 
i know ... 
llewelyn would never ask for help . he never thinks he needs any . 
if i tell you where llewelyn 's headed you promise it 'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else ? 
yeah right . sheriff can you give me your word on somethin' ? 
why you tellin ' me that sheriff ? 
he can take all comers . 
he wo n't neither . he never has . 
llewelyn can take care of hisself .

i better go check on them . 
wait a second ! i am not the reason you're here ! i was minding my own business living a perfectly boring life until you came along ! 
i 'm sorry . 
i thought you were a garbageman of humanity or something . 
i wrote that when i was twelve ... where 'd you get that ? ! 
i do n't feel that no . i just ... i 'm not really who you think i am . 
umm i do n't think that ... 
i am ? 
... well if you 're not going to slit my throat why 'd you come up here ? 
drugs ? god no ! i 'm totally against drugs . 
i have no idea what he was mixed up in ... it was always something . 
i 've got a pretty good idea . you 're here to kill me so kill me . you want me to be afraid but i 'm not . i do n't care who you are or why you two killed my husband ... 
... i ... i know what you are . 
... i s'pose you did that so i could take my sweater off or something . 
this is roy ostrey he 's a reporter . and this is sheriff ballard . we all went to fair oaks high together ... 
umm ... yes . back home . 
yes ma'am . 
it 's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun has palm trees out front mountains in the background ... 
of course he 's only here two days a week . he 's also on staff over at loma vista . 
dr. ravell 's the finest surgeon on the staff . you must know him . he 's incredibly handsome gentle considerate . he 's being sued for sexual assault right now but --   it 's not true . he was set up . 
i got ta go . 
tell del i 'm sorry . i left so quick but i need to do this . 
what are you talking about ? 
sue ann i thought you of all people would back me up on this you know what del 's like . how did he take my note ? 
sue ann i 'm sorry about all this but i just know there 's something special out there for me ... 
something bad happened to del and me did n't it ?

yep . hey i got a surprise for tonight . we 're going to the starlite in style ! 
did you watch it yet ? 
... it 's too bad you 're such an asshole . 's the only thing that del was ever right about .

mmm - hmm . listen i forgive you mr. mccord ... 
kinda like you 'd been saying it since you got on the plane ...

i 'm sorry ... oh my gosh are you george mccord ? ! 
david please -- 
what do you mean ? what did i do to you ... 
why are you doing this to me ? 
david i do n't ... can we talk privately for a second ? 
ad lib ? 
i remember . you said it to her but it was meant for me was n't it ? 
well i just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around . i promise ... 
... but i love listening to you so that 's okay ... 
it 's easy to be dedicated when you care about something ... 
i know that 's why we were meant to be together ... 
no i would have remembered that name . the only stella i ever knew was a parrot .   was this before leslie ? before us ? ... 
you never mentioned a ' stella ' to me . 
she 's a little jealous i think . and confused when it comes to men ...   so where are we going ? 
i know . it 's up to us . 
of course . 
i just want everything to be perfect between us . 
you should have a little faith in people . 
are you sure i can borrow this ? 
no almost never . 
yes . i 'd never been in a place like that before . 
to a party in the hollywood hills . 
oh my gosh everything ! my trip out here what we 've both been doing you know ... 
he is real .

i do n't think she will . she 's a slut but i just do n't think she 's that mean . jasmine'll bring her around ... 
no . but i 'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back . 
no .   well her grandparents are down in oklahoma but that 's it ... 
i wish i could help you but i ca n't . 
does he ever talk about medicine ? his patients the hospital ? 
well what if this guy 's just playing with you ? what if he 's lying about who he is ? 
no please . go ahead it 's your funeral ... 
but you 're in love with someone who does n't exist . you come here you meet this guy who should laugh in your face and instead you leave with him !   betty you are one - of - a - kind ... 
this is n't fair you know . do you always get what you want ? 
i have lots of times . my mother used to clean them . i used to piss in their pools . 
was it a huge place ? with a view of the whole world ? 
no i 'm not sure i could begin to imagine ... so where 'd you go ? 
uh - huh ... so what 'd you talk about ? 
does he know you think he 's real ? 
you still in love ? 
were you with him this whole time ? 
you never know who you 'll see . 
oh it 's a charity dinner . the money goes to a good cause but i do n't have anybody to go with ... 
so what do you say ? can we be friends ? 
this is crazy . i come home you go to your room . you go in the kitchen i go to my room . it 's stupid . 
i 'm not going back on our arrangement . my word is good and my family owes you . but i think it 's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can . 
i helped you because i 'm an idiot ! ask my mother i love it when people take advantage of me ! i trusted you ! ! i thought he was real ! 
it 's not about gas money ! !   you have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera and we searched all over town for his character ! not the actor -- whose name is george by the way . his character ! 
i spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist . i should have been here at the hospital with my brother but i was with you . 
i'm talking about david ravell ! ! 
either you 're making a fool out of me because you get off on it or you got serious problems . which one is it ? ! 
on television ! !   cut the shit will you ! 
doctor david ravell . 
guess who i saw today . 
i was talking about what you could wear ! 
jesus ! they 're all gon na be calling me ! 
fuck the details they 're always to blame ... look too many of these guys duck out on us especially after they become doctors or lawyers . i see it at my company all day long ! so i 'm just gon na make sure you get your you know fairy tale ending or whatever ...   one of us should . 
... so we 'll hit the library first and fan out from there . they 've got all the l.a. phone books plus medical directories ...   we 're not gon na let him hide from you any more okay ? i 'm making this my personal mission . 
jesus i thought my love life was crazy ... 
her ' head ' ? ! you 're making this up ... 
god that 's awful ! 
he has a wife ? ! 
what are you talking about ? this bar is packed with professional people !   everybody says if you 're going to get married this is the spot to meet someone ... luckily i 'm currently off men so i 've got the luxury of not giving a shit . 
you made it ! hey that looks great on you . 's classy ...   so how 'd it go today ? you find him ? 
huh ? sure look in my closet take any dress you want !   we 're still on for tonight right ? 
just look for the really crowded road and follow that . 
tustin ? take the hollywood freeway to the five ... 
oh i dunno ... but just once i wish i 'd run into a guy who noticed the koi before my tits . 
yeah well at least fish do n't use your razor or pee on the seat ... 
no this one was worse ... i had to have the place sprayed when he left . twice ... he was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there which i 'm trusting you with 'cause if it gets out i 'm on the street ... 
i got this apartment with a guy . 
listen when someone does the kind of thing you did you got ta do something in return . so you stay with me until you find your david and live happily ever after . okay ? 
you can go get your stuff right now . i 'll walk you down . 
man that is love . 
' david . ' that 's your guy . so you staying with him ? 
so why 'd you come to l.a. ? 
you do n't sound like you 're from here . 
are you crazy ? ! ! stop it ! ! ! 
you 're hurting him ! ! 
what are you doing ? 
oh yeah ... man i 'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face watch her bubble burst in mid - air . 
i 'm not sure now . she said he used to be over at loma vista . i never heard of it . 
david ravell . 
she 's gon na have to 'cause i 'm out of ideas . 
betty . it 's o.k. except i 'm worn out . we spent all weekend looking for her doctor - boy . how can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself ? 
probably the same thing my mom would do if i got engaged ... have a heart attack . 
then do as you 're told . get her back . 
why would i give a shit how you feel . and i got news for you . i loved your ' icy water ' idea the other day ... i 'm toying with the idea of killing david ravell off in a boating accident . 
you fucked it up . who would n't freeze in those circumstances ? and i do n't care what her problems are . she would n't be the first one in that cast with problems . we have nothing to lose by making her an offer . 
this story is beyond belief which is perfect for us . it 's free advertising and it 's gon na run for months . 
i said forget it ! 
all right everybody ! that 's ten minutes ! 
is there a problem george ? 
what the hell 's going on ? 
actually she was my discovery ... just like you . 
i said i 'll think about it . 
i 'll think about it . 
i do n't know george ... 
no george we 've already done that with lonnie . the blind one last year remember ? 
we know that ... 
i know george i was there . i 'm not denying that she 's good . 
yeah bring your friend along . i 'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do ... 
funny that 's just what i was thinking ... 
alright i admit it you had me there . you 're better than most of them anyway ... do you have a headshot ? 
i counted to three honey . 
that was n't my doing ... 
i do n't care if it 's ninety thousand . 
uh - huh . 
well we need that ring . 
or in my chiffonier . i do n't know . 
or it might a been under the mattress . 
i said i thought it was in the rolltop desk . 
that 's one of aunt hurlene 's . 
that 's not my ring . 
that 's not my ring . 
that 's good honey . 
that 's right honey . 
no weddin ' . 
ai n't gon na be no weddin ' . 
we ai n't gettin ' married with his ring !   you said you 'd changed ! 
i ai n't worn it since our divorce came through . it must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin . never thought i 'd need it ; vernon bought one encrusted with jewels . 
mcgill . no the marriage'll take place as planned . 
i can and i am and i will - tomorrow ! i got ta think about the little wharvey gals ! they look to me for answers ! vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet ! the only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train ! 
no - you stop it ! vernon here 's got a job . vernon 's got prospects . he 's bona fide ! what 're you ? 
that ai n't your daddy alvinelle . your daddy was hit by a train . 
yes i do ! 
uh - uh ! not a chance ! there 's nobody in this town doing anything with his life except what his father did which is nothing . if i ca n't have more out of life than that i 'd rather be dead ! 
do n't you dare ask me that question . i 'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that ! 
i do n't know what it is . it could be anything . 
daddy i do n't want to get into anything with you tonight . i 'm tired and i ... 
i know i 'm late and i 'm sorry but mrs. rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and ... 
no ! that 's not true ! 
god help you lynette ! 
lynette where 's sid ? 
no . i never feel like that . 
that do n't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant lynette ! nothing justifies that . i ca n't believe you 're even thinking like that . i mean that 's really backward . 
no way ... would you ? 
what do you mean ? 
i have n't made up my mind . 
he 'll show . i 'd bet my paycheck on it . 
i told zack about saturday night too . the fifth week 's supposed to be the roughest . come wednesday he 'll be wishing he took my number . 
he ask you out for next weekend ? 
how did it go with you guys ? 
everything was different . 
yeah ... mmmm ... 
hurry lynette . it 's almost midnight . 
that was you guys huh ? 
do n't worry . it grows out about an inch by them . 
yeah i saw 'em . poor guys . 
lynette watch your mouth ! somebody might overhear . 
one more minute . 
maybe not but it is the truth . and zack you did n't kill him either . 
however you got it figured i did n't kill sid and lynette did n't kill him ! he killed himself ! 
i 'm not a puget deb . i hate that goddamn term ! 
yeah . you got the whole story just right . 
please stop it . none of that 's true . goddamnit i love you . i loved you ever since i met you . 
because he 's my friend too . 
i 'd like to come with you . 
i 'm not playing any games ! go look at lynette 's ! 
why 'd he do it ? 
sure .   zack i hope you know i did n't have to show you that picture . 
call me during the week if you get the chance . 
twenty - two years ago . 
because my real father would n't marry her . 
for a start i would n't marry a man i was n't in love with . 
some day . when i 'm sure i can do a better job of it than my folks . 
zack do you ever think about what it 'd be like to have kids ... a family . 
so after you graduate you go on to basic flight right ? is that in pensacola ? 
that 's okay . i 'm used to it . 
i 'm so embarrassed . i knew i should n't have brought you here . 
are those for me ? 
when i 'm good and ready . 
zack i do n't know if i want to do that ... 
i 've seen all that a hundred times . 
what 's the matter ? 
i understand . maybe we 'll see each other after the show ... 
does it still hurt ? 
who says i 'm not going after what i want ? my mother 's thirty - nine years old and she still works in that factory . every time i see her i know exactly what i do n't want . 
i do n't care what the magazines say ... it 's just not as easy being a girl especially from a catholic family . you do n't know the junk i grew up listening to 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act . 
you know sometimes i wish i was one of those girls they 're letting in the flight program these days . god i 'd love to fly . 
they found them like that shriveled up from weeks without food or water ... 
i do n't want you to move . 
want me to get a towel ? 
it sure was . 
any time sailor . 
zack when you 're through with a girl what do you do ? do you say something or do you just ... disappear ? 
i 'm serious . it 's gon na be hard to get enough . 
zack i dare you not to fall in love with me . i ai n't gon na get serious with you no way . but how can you resist me ? i 'm like candy . 
to have a good time with you until you have to go . 
i know who you are and what you want . 
wrong . i 've driven a hundred and twenty miles told a hundred and twenty lies and said a hundred and twenty hail mary 's since i saw you . hungry ? 
you got no manners and you never tell the truth ! you 're nothin' special . and if you ask me you got no chance at all of being an officer ! 
i do n't know who you think you 're talking to ! i ai n't some whore you brought here ! i 've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit ! 
where 's that coming from ? i would n't fuck now if my life depended on it ! 
opening up just a little would n't kill you ya know . 
where 'd you learn to fight like that ? 
he did n't give you much choice . 
i vote for the motel . 
who cares ?   mmmm . now i remember . mayo the wop . gee i 'm glad you 're here . i 've been looking forward to this all week . 
just think ' i 'm gon na do it ! ' program yourself . see yourself making it . it 'll happen . i know 'cause i just read this article in cosmo and it was about that very thing . 
think you 'll make it all the way to getting your wings ? 
no . i work for national paper . it 's a good job . i make eight - twenty - three an hour .   when i get enough money saved i plan to go on to college . 
to meet interesting people improve myself . you would n't believe the losers we got over in port angeles . 
not me . 
you got a girl ? 
really ? i 've never been out of washington except once when i visited this aunt of mine over to portland . i mean over at portland . ai n't it pathetic the way folks talk around here ? 
where are you from mayo the wop ? 
polish . what kind of name is mayo ? 
i 'm not pregnant . i got my period this morning . there 's no baby sid . 
sid there 's no baby . 
but ... but what would we do ? where would we go ? 
you what ? 
let 's go tell paula ! god i wonder where we 'll be stationed first . i hope it 'll be hawaii . i 've always wanted to go to hawaii . 
sid ! oh it 's beautiful ! you mean ... 
i ca n't go like this . ca n't you wait a few minutes ' til i 'm ready ? 
what 're you doing out of uniform sid ? you do n't want to get in trouble . 
let 's just wait and see what happens . 
what other issue is there sid ? 
what do you care ? suppose i was pregnant . just suppose it . you do n't think i 'd try to make you do anything you do n't want to do you ? 
what difference does it make ? if anything was to happen which i 'm sure it is n't it would be my responsibility . 
i 'm a little late that 's all . 
then i 'll see you around . 
if you wo n't take me to dinner with your parents i wo n't meet you at the motel . 
sid worley i think you 're ashamed of me . 
like pick up some booze and go to a motel ? 
do n't worry . i 'll respect you afterwards . 
now what on earth would give you an idea like that ? 
we do n't have to talk at all . 
i had a big brother who died over there too . he was n't no flyer though . he was just your basic marine corps type . i was only twelve when it happened so i do n't remember much about him . 
is your brother a flyer ? 
you been through the dilbert dunker yet ? 
is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here ? 
you 're no better than me paula ! you 're just the same ! 
already come and gone . can you believe it ? he dored in the twelfth week . how can you win ? 
i do . 
no more backward if you ask me than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us then ditch us .   do n't you ever feel used paula ? do n't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it ... ? 
i never used to think i 'd do something like that but now i 'm not so sure . you ask me nine weeks just ai n't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you . 
you know what i mean . would you ... let yourself get pregnant ? 
paula how far would you go to catch zack ? 
you serious about having him over ? 
you hope . 
no but i told him i 'd be at the town tavern next saturday night and he sounded like he might come . 
big sid came in about two and a half seconds then had the nerve to ask ' did you make it too sweetheart ? ' 
but in what ways ? 
what did he do ? did he do anything that was different ? 
details pokrif . from what i saw he had an incredible body . 
well it you 're not gon na ask then i will . how was it ? 
i got my foot on the floor .

that there is n't one as of today . i had my period .   i could n't believe it . he still wanted to marry me . 
well excuse me for livin ' ! 
god ! i 've never seen anything like that in my whole life ! did you see that guy 's nose ?

is that right dad ? 
what if you ca n't read what 's written on there anymore ? 
well ... i guess not . 
but where are we going mr. crandall ? 
i 'm ellen creed and i live at 642 alden lane dearborn michigan .   at least i used to . 
please hurry .

he 's a ghost . but he 's a good ghost . 
paxcow says daddy 's going to do something really bad . he-- 
paxcow says it 's almost too late ! we have to go back ! paxcow says it 's almost too late ! 
paxcow says it 's almost too late ! 
i want to fly it ! can i fly it now mommy ! 
but what if he dies and has to go to the pet sematary ? 
am i really gon na have my own room ? 
do you swear ? 
come with us daddy . please come with us ! 
and i 'm going to eat his breakfast cereal too even though it tastes like boogers . and ... and ... 
then why do i have to go to bed ? 
i 'm not tired ! 
yeah sure . 
i do n't get it . 
you believe in it . 
do you believe that ? 
sure carnation . like in that movie you rented audrey rose . 
i won't ... is missy in heaven do you think ? 
at school michael mcdowell said she was gon na fry in hell . michael mcdowell says all sewersides fry in hell . 
daddy do you think missy dandridge went to heaven ? 
missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world -- even mom said so . now there wo n't be any more because she 's gon na be dead forever ! 
no more chocolate chip cookies . 
she 's in bed . she was throwing up . ever since mrs. rogers called and said missy-- 
i hate that smell . 
because you promised . 
is he really all right ? 
cause i had a bad dream about him . i dreamed he got hit by a car and you and mr. crandall buried him in the pet sematary . 
fine ... except when mom was airing gage 's diaper rash he walked away and got into grampa 's study and pooped in grampa 's favorite chair . 
missy dandridge . and she says it 's a operation ! 
it does n't seem long to me . it seems short . i think the whole thing about pets dying s - s - sucks ! 
in the end he 's gon na croak is n't he ? 
that 's what i think . i heard missy dandridge tell mom when church was fixed he would n't cross the road so much . 
to remember . 
i want to look around daddy-- may i ? 
well i thought it was safe-- 
hurrts ! it hurrrrts ! 
i will . come and kiss me . 
of course i will . 
there are no ghosts ellie . i want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense . 
who is this paxcow ? is he like the boogeyman ? 
ellie ... ellie ... what ... 
in a minute hon . let gage finish his turn . 
honey church will be fine . 
yes but the rope might be-- 
it 's gorgeous ! 
do n't bother . i 'm coming home . 
was it pascow ? 
jud do you remember the name of the student that died on louis 's first day at work ? the one that was hit by a car ? 
how can you call it a good thing ? a graveyard for pets killed in the road ! built and maintained by broken- hearted children ! 
excuse me mr. crandall -- i've got to change this kid . it 's nice to meet you . 
i 'm rachel . thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy here . 
louis are you sure ? 
oh louis i just do n't know about this-- 
i 'm going to try to do better . 
not by me it is n't . i know how badly i acted how unfair i was . it 's just that i .. you know . 
i 'm sorry i could n't go with you to missy 's funeral . and that i blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard . 
that 's not true . the subject scares me . because of zelda . 
i heard you tonight . 
i got eggs down here ! 
thank you louis . 
do n't shilly - shally louis . give the little girl her promise . 
you 'll be fine ellie . now you can be excused . go and wash your face . 
i know what you just said . ellie clear your place . 
that 's enough of that kind of talk ! 
do n't be silly . church is not going to die . 
do you think i did n't hear her tonight crying as if her heart would break ? here she is thinking church is going to die . 
it was that place . that creepy cemetery up in the woods . whatever disease the kids in this town have got i do n't want ellie to catch it . 
she 's finally asleep . 
extraordinarily morbid maybe . 
it 's beautiful ! 
---and you 'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and--- 
you 're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy are you ? 
yes -- i know . this path louis ? where does it go ? 
thank you . thank you so much . 
gage 's gone ! 
come on -- let 's parole 'em . 
louis the house is beautiful . 
will -- you ca n't trust him . 
the curse drove you to gather this ? 
it 's a pirate medallion . 
then why are n't you eating ? 
dare i ask the fate of it previous owner ? 
can i trust you ? 
of course .   i did n't steal it if that 's what you mean . 
thank you sir . 
elizabeth --   turner .   i 'm a maid in the governor 's household . 
because it 's what you 're searching for .   you 've been searching for it for years .   i recognize this ship . i saw it eight years ago when we made the crossing from england . 
i 'll drop it ! 
very well . 
i want you to leave .   and never come back . 
captain barbossa ... i have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against port royal . 
well i am not going to stay hidden in some cabin or i suppose it 's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage ! 
then i can wear men 's clothing . 
not as a condition -- a request . 
commodore i beg you -- please do this ... for me .   as a wedding gift . 
commodore please ! 
no .   the pirates have taken will -- 
he can locate isla de muerta -- but i doubt he 'll be willing to help us from the brig . 
commodore you ca n't do that ! 
yes i 'm all right i 'm fine !   go capture him . 
commodore i must protest .   pirate or not this man saved my life . 
i ca n't breathe . 
his name is will turner -- that 's all i found out . 
boy overboard ! 
i think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate . 
about the day we met . do you remember ? 
women in london must have learned to not breathe . 
difficult ... to say . 
i knew it . 
it 's -- beautiful . may i inquire as to the occasion ? 
yes -- yes . 
yes father . 
actually i find it all fascinating . 
tell the captain that i am disinclined to acquiesce to his request . 
if an adversary demands parlay you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete . 
parlay !   i invoke the right of parlay !   according to the code of the brethern set down by the pirates morgan and bartholomew you must take me to your captain ! 
it does n't ! 
there .   and do n't you dare tell me that was n't a proper kiss ! 
i guess you can never truly know someone else 's heart . 
-- then we never would have met . 
to keep it away from them ?   no pirate would sail to london for fear of execution dock . 
truthfully -- you were a bit late . 
will how many times must i ask you to call me ' elizabeth ' ? 
what 's your plan ? 
these men will be facing an enemy that seemingly can not be killed . 
he might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late . 
you did n't tell commodore norrington everything . 
that signal is over a thousand feet high which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction .   the entire royal navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it ? 
one because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels . two -- 
yes the rum is gone . 
to freedom . 
mr. sparrow !   i 'm not sure i 've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk . 
jack it must be so terrible for you to be trapped here on this island all over again . 
you 'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the spanish main . 
well perhaps ... with a bit more to drink i might ... 
that was before i met one of course . 
oh no ... it 's silly .   back in england we did n't know a thing about pirates really .   they seemed so romantic and daring -- 
nothing ... it 's nothing .   just ... i 'm reminded of a song i learned as a child .   a song about pirates . 
drink up me hearties yo ho ... 
not when you can drink instead at least . 
a month ?   will does n't have a month !   we 've got to do something to help him ! 
so that 's it ?   that 's the secret grand adventure of the infamous jack sparrow ?   you spent three days on the beach drinking rum ? 
but ... you did it before !   last time -- 
what ?   what 's wrong ?   how will this help us get off the island ? 
captain sparrow !   we have to get off this island -- immediately ! 
has it changed since the last time you were here ? 
come on ! 
you 're in league with barbossa ! 
you ? ! 
you are despicable . 
miss swann . 
what did you use ? 
what are you going to do to him ? 
i swear to you argon if you do n't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one i ever build . 
how do you know we 're not heading in the wrong direction ? 
i suppose you are going to tell me where it is going . 
does that mean oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb ? 
no thank you . 
you ca n't mean that . 
but in another twenty - four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period .   there will be no way to stop it . 
if you think i would ever give you the nanobot after this you are deluding yourself . 
dr. argon i demand an explanation . 
make me ?   how ?   you think he 's going to torture me ? 
you mean the designs for the nanobot ?   you think after this i 'm going to give them to him ? 
you 're afraid of him . 
nigel ca n't you see he 's using you ? 
is that what argon told you ? 
argon is a lunatic !   i ca n't believe i was stupid enough to believe i could control him .   you heard what he said nigel .   he does n't care if all of calumet city is turned to jell - o.   how can that not affect you ? 
there 's a guard outside my door ! i 'm a prisoner nigel !   do you understand that ? 
i do n't believe this is happening ... 
dr. argon i know you want to use the nanobot on yourself but you must n't .   the situation is critical right now .   the replicators are growing exponentially .   if we wait much longer it will be too late . you have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown . 
you were never invited to my house . 
what i 've always done .   as long as i 'm the only one who can build the nanobot i 'm the only one who can say when it should be tested . 
i hope you 're right .   i 'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just did n't care . 
this day just keeps going from bad to worse . 
the replicators ? 
they 'll in validate the key . probably nothing . 
yeah .   but it was n't a group .   it was one man . 
they also tried using viral r.n.a. as the bonding element . 
do you remember about five years ago that uh ... incident at purnell labs ? 
i 'm not sure .   that 's the funny thing about him .   he 's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it . 
yeah .   i knew him when i was still in school . 
this morning .   i saw someone i have n't seen in a long time . 
what ?   oh i 'm sorry nigel .   i was just thinking ... 
things do change . 
do you suppose that was our problem ? we met before our time ?   i think that happens a lot .   people events planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place . 
god what a fight that was . 
god when we were in that store all i could think about was that one time when we were in school and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal .   do you remember that ? 
do the words ' hero fantasies ' mean anything to you ?   how about ' infantile dementia ' ? 
you 're not going after argon ! 
daniel just forget argon .   let 's get out of here .   we 'll find another way to stop the waste . 
the same thing i suppose . 
it 's too late .   argon injected it . 
oh shit the meltdown .   it 's spread to the tower . 
you do n't have to say anything daniel .   i 'm a scientist .   i know what 's happening .   i recognize the classic symptoms .   dizziness shortness of breath sweating palms ... i can feel my adrenals secreting my parasympathetic nervous system quivering the estradiol coursing through my entire body ... 
did you think i could just leave you ... ? 
run daniel !   get out of here ! 
argon 's private lab . 
oh no !   argon !   we have to stop him before he uses the nanobot !   we have to get the nanobot ! 
i did n't know what was going to happen .   i was just so worried something was going to happen to you . 
i do n't believe it .   you 're here ! oh thank god . 
you 're not going back to jail .   all we need to do is find the nanobot . once the meltdown is under control then we deal with argon -- 
oh no .   they 're trying to blame you for the accident .   that means they must not have been able to control the replicators . 
who is he ? 
did you go ? 
sort of .   we used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers . 
like a glove . 
it 's a crime fighting costume what do you think ?   it 's underwear so if you lose your clothes you 'll still be decent . 
that 's pretty good . 
i was hoping you were over that . remember to keep drinking fluids . 
i think it would be better for me to go alone .   i 'm sure sim is looking for you .   just sit tight .   i 'll bring you back a pizza . 
something else i want to try . 
i 'm going to go out for a while .   i want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment i need . 
how far can you stretch ? 
the nanobot ... it 's not here ... 
daniel i did n't hear you come down ... 
no problem . 
probably the caffeine . 
i 'm glad you came to me for help . 
just like old times . 
come on i do n't see you living in a cave ! 
and i 'm sure you thought columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world ! 
you 're not protecting the world you 're obstructing progress ! 
victim my ass !   you stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage !   maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved ! 
you have no one to blame but yourself . 
what 's that supposed to mean ? 
i 'm sorry daniel but you have to admit it 's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized .   it 's got to mean something . 
the polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate .   so what 's wrong ? 
what about it ! 
what ?   what 's wrong ? 
is something wrong ? 
lungs sound fine .   you did n't have any pre - existing physical conditions did you ?   allergies ? infections ? 
i think while we 're waiting we had better run some basic diagnostics on you . 
that 's right . 
with enough exposure the same thing they do to everything else . 
three days ago it was . 
the replicators start off like assemblers but the replicators never stabilize . 
the problem is the by - product created by the process . 
the nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a good year tire than a human being . 
to put is simply the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger r.n.a. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level . 
the nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste . 
if you do n't want to do it this way i can remove it surgically . 
the nanobot is still inside you . it 's programmed to exit through the urinary tract .   we need it as soon as possible so swallow those . 
mostly caffeine diuretics .   help you go to the bathroom . 
what has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to calumet city if we do n't hurry . 
we do n't have time for hysterics . 
once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure . 
it escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment . 
i do n't know . 
my first organic - polymerization was a lab mouse . 
... just like the mouse . 
the nanobot . 
sorry daniel i 'm a physicist not a psychiatrist . 
daniel what are you doing here ? 
daniel give him the trix . 
you 're insane . 
i 'm sorry i brought the whole thing up !   if you 're gon na flip your wig -- 
we 've had this conversation already daniel . 
god daniel i 'm not going to make agent orange . 
we 'll see ?   what does that mean ? 
and what i love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think .   it unifies the entire world on a single level . everything is completely connected . sometimes i can really feel it everything around us just a small part of a whole .   it 's really wonderful . 
nothing really worthwhile . 
well it was good to see you daniel but i have to be going . 
it was a long time ago daniel .   we were young different people heading in different directions . that 's all . 
and for cleaning up oil spills . 
it already is . 
i guess i should be flattered . 
jesus daniel .   it was n't ryker 's island .   it was work camp for white collar criminals . 
the big house ? 
is that so ? 
same old daniel . 
really ?   what have you been doing ? 
when did you ... ? 
okay barbie let 's get this over with . 
get him daniel !   knock his block off ! 
you wo n't .   that 's why you 're whispering . 
just one question .   since dr. argon no longer has feeling below his waist how is it that you 're still able to do your job ? 
look as i have said and will continue to say the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority -- 
under the circumstances i ca n't fathom what makes dr. argon think we are ready for anything bigger .   if c.n.n. or hell if the e.p.a. knew what was in my basement -- 
i am aware of dr. argon 's frustrations . 
can i help you mrs. argon ? 
what in the hell ? 
yes he might be . 
yes that is what i was thinking . 
it might be paranoia but i 've never lost my keycard before . 
you do n't seem to understand that this one 's different . he has brains . 
yes it 'll be a very interesting experiment . 
oh stew and i went for a long ride .   dexter is there any finishing school we can send him to ? 
i think you should miss gallagher . 
goodbye miss gallagher . 
miss wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need miss gallagher . 
indeed ? how interesting . 
you 're acting like a child . 
that 's ridiculous . 
you ca n't walk out of here like this . 
your house ? 
unreasonable !   have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs ? do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom ? 
the idea is simply this - that i want those people to leave here immediately . 
i see . 
good morning . what does this mean ? 
that 's exactly what you mean . heaven knows you 've made that clear to me often enough . well i 'm sick and tired of it . i 've given you party after party - i 've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful ? no ! you insult them and act like a bore . i 'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you 've done . perhaps it 's just as well you 're not coming tonight . maybe i can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you and what you 're going to do . 
meaning my friends are n't worthwhile i suppose ? 
but i do n't want to meet your gang . 
will you stop being silly stewart ? 
are you crazy ? 
look out for my lipstick stewart . 
stewart would you mind telling me why you 're not going ? 
what am i going downstairs and tell those people ? 
what are you talking about ? 
stop trying to be funny and get ready will you ? 
stewart ! we 're all waiting for you . where 's your valet ? 
is this true stewart ? did you really say it ? 
i thought i was very charming stewart . 
no ? what do you look upon her as ? 
yes - is n't it ? 
yes . as a matter of fact you failed to mention that gallagher was a girl . 
you know stewart you failed to mention that miss gallagher was a very beautiful young girl . 
oh yes of course . how do you do ? 
oh yes you will wear garters 
oh yes you will my dear - oh yes you will my dear - you 'll eat spinach but you 'll wear garters too ! 
oh yes you will my dear - oh yes you will my dear - you 'll wear garters and you 'll like it too ! 
darling i do n't care whether you can look gallagher in the face or not but you 're gon na be a good boy and wear garters . 
i know that . 
you wear them of course silly . 
do you like them ? 
i 've got a present . shut your eyes . keep 'em closed . i know you 're going to love them . 
oh i love that nose . it 's such a sweet nose . 
listen stew baby let 's not talk about things like that now 
what do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat ? 
you have the cutest nose i've 
of course i am stewart . 
but we do n't need it i 'm sure . 
oh darling of course it would . if it is n't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that is n't enough mother will give us the blue room too i think . 
do n't you think it 's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house 
your place ? 
you ought to get some new ties stewart . 
i 'm glad . 
now mother your attitude is perfectly ridiculous . it 's done now . stewart and i are married . 
that 's because you 're too far away stew . 
none of your ideas can be goofy stew if they concern me . 
why should i ? we 're happy are n't we darling ? 
hello natalie . mr. stewart smith . . . miss montgomery mrs. eames mrs. radcliff mr. radcliff 
please go . i 'll explain to mother . 
oh mother ! 
not if you 're going to lose any sleep about it . 
i 'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you . 
you do n't wear garters ! 
you 're a bit eccentric are n't you ? 
wo n't even pretend it is n't a very great favor . i wish there was something i could do for you 
you 're a peculiar person . why the other day i pleaded with you not to send in that story and  
i do n't know how to thank you . mother'll be so grateful - she 'll probably want to kiss you . 
for the letters of course . 
will - uh - five thousand be enough ? 
will you step into the library ? 
oh i do n't need another guess . it 's quite obvious . 
i suppose you 're going to print them ? 
where did you get those letters ? 
i 'm not interested . smythe will open the door . 
just a moment . i do n't see how that trash could possibly concern me . 
i 'm not interested in your literary recommendations . 
that 's considerate of you . 
what do you want ? 
you may go smythe . 
certainly . right over there . 
oh thank you i knew you 'd understand . 
you 're not going to print this silly thing are you ? 
i 'm sure you 're quite willing to be decent about this . 
do n't mind mother . 
why does n't dexter show some decency ? and you might show some too mother . what do you expect a man to do when he 's called such names ?   i 'm glad you hit that reporter stewart . he deserved it . 
you do n't have anything to complain about mother . he was all right last night was n't he ? i told you not to worry about him . 
oh the usual thing . blah blah blah attended the blah blah reception and wore the same blah blah things . 
good morning mother . did n't i tell you that he 'd be marvelous . everybody thought he was so charming last night . 
mother i promise you that he wo n't be a reporter much longer . once i get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named gallagher 
oh hello mother ! 
splendid mother . let 's hop over to monte carlo . it 's a great place to save a face . 
you should have known better than to write romeo . i found that out a long time ago . 
i think i better go stew . 
thank you . i 'll go and look for her at once . goodbye mrs. smith . 
yes - is n't it . 
i bet . 
thank you .   where is mr. smith ? 
why a list of the guests . that 's the usual thing is n't it ? 
i was sent from the post in place of our social editor . 
but that 's ridiculous ! you ca n't make a sudden change like that . 
what other girl ? 
well from now on the play will be easy . all you have to do is bring the wife back have her say she 's sorry and then your play 's over . 
what did he want ? 
who was that ? 
it 'll be ready in a minute . 
i would n't worry too much about it stew . she 'll see it your way . 
very good . 
nope - afraid i 'm all out of tricks tonight . 
here you are . 
what could i be ? 
oh sure . she 'd make a beautiful heroine ... 
then why do n't you write about something you know ?   write about yourself and anne . the poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there 's a swell theme . 
did n't he go to sea before he wrote about it ? 
is n't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about ? 
i do n't know a thing about him but is n't he the one you 're always yelling about ? 
did conrad draw on his imagination ? 
then how do you expect to write about it ? 
to old madrid . 
stewart have you ever been to old madrid ? 
well you 're not getting your play done but you 're certainly covering a lot of territory . 
how far have you gotten ? 
yes - and i 'd love it . 
i 'm sorry stew . i asked hank and hank did the rest . 
hello stew . 
oh that 's all right stew . forget it . as far as she 's concerned i 'm just part of the hired help . 
they all consider me just as one of the boys . 
my mistake - she 's glaring . 
do n't turn around now - but there 's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us . 
i dyed one and washed the other . 
say who 's been tying your ties lately ? it looks rotten . 
well i 'll have to look someplace else . 
i 'm pinch - hitting for our society editor tonight . i wanted to see some life in the raw . 
there you are ! 
mr. smith i 've read some of your plays and i 'd like an autograph . 
how is her family going to feel about it ? 
sure - i think so stew . 
do n't pay attention to him stew . he does n't know what he 's talking about . 
oh i 'll call you up some time . and if your social duties permit - why - 
oh no you wo n't mr. smith . you 're a married man now . mother always warned me never to run around with married men . 
my error . 
remember she 's a schuyler . 
do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates ? 
not since you broke into society . 
who me ? she would n't want to meet me . i 'm just an old load of hay . 
it 's the smoke . 
i hope you 'll be very happy . 
sure . i wish you all the luck in the world pal . 
i did n't run away . 
and the rest of us are truck horses ? 
on now stew do n't be too hard on her . i would n't call her a brewery horse . 
of course i have n't got a nose . 
well i 've seen her pictures and i do n't think she 's so hot . 
for heaven 's sake stew are you completely bats ? what for ? i thought the story was cold . you ca n't go back there . 
you what ? 
you 're sure going to be poison to that junior leaguer[4 ] from now on ! 
the boss is getting hoarse . 
stew your hands are shaking . you 've been drinking again . 
well ...   ... your father would never do anything like that . 
yes ...   it 's just that ... 
no . i want to know . 
well you hear all these things lately . you know -- kids spending so much time up there ...   is it holding hands ? that kind of thing ? 
what goes on up at lover 's lane ? 
can i ask you a question ? 
mary sue ? 
oh nonsense young lady . you 're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast . 
i put blueberries in them just the way you like . 
i just love you in that sweater mary - sue . it 's so flattering . 
i love you too . 
i 'm so proud of you bud . 
and ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold . 
there 's a meatloaf sandwich in there too . do n't go skipping dinner just 'cause you 're not here anymore . 
i had to say goodbye . 
i made you these for the trip . they 're marshmallow rice squares . 
thank you . 
and they wo n't be able to tell ? 
does it look okay ? 
in my handbag . 
i ca n't go out there . how can i go out there ? 
how 'bout some marshmallow rice squares ? 
why no . she 's still on her date with biff ... is something the matter ? 
bu - ud ... mary sue ... your breakfast is getting cold . 
bud . mary sue ... breakfast is on the table . 
like a drum . 
sounds nice ... once you get used to it . 
but i really should get home . 
what is that ? 
i 've got to go ... 
yes she is . 
she 's crying . 
she 's crying . 
where 'd you get this ? 
i think it looks nice . 
i just thought ... it 's beautiful . 
i 'm sorry ... 
hello bill . 
i 'm gon na go now . 
i made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...   i 'm gon na go now . 
no i 'm not sweetie . 
i do n't want it to go away . 
i do n't want to put on some make up ... 
look at me george . that meeting 's not for me . look at my face . 
no i 'm not . 
i told you george . i 'm not going . 
i got caught in the storm . you were gone all night too . 
i told you where i was . 
oh george ... 
oh darling that 's wonderful !   i always knew you could do it . 
how was your day ? 
you sure you want to know this ? 
... sex . 
it does n't matter . 
yeah ...   that -- and ... 
what do you mean ? 
actually -- i'm not real ... hungry . 
i said no !   ... i 've read like one book in my whole life and i 'll be damned if i let you throw it on that fire ... 
do n't ! just let go . 
i 'm busy . 
oh .   i ca n't . 
what are you doing ? 
trust me ... 
it 's s'posed to happen biff . 
... why ? 
oh yeah ... gorgeous . 
... lover 's lane . 
you wanna get out of here ? you wanna leave ? 
you want to get out of here ? 
oh you bet .   will you excuse me for a sec ? 
oh gosh no . 
well sometimes talking 's over - rated . do n't you think ? 
gosh . i hardly know what to say . 
really biff ? the keenest ? 
um ... it 's ... 
i 've done the slut thing david . it 's really kinda old . 
right here . 
besides . you think there 's like a chance i 'm gon na get into college back there ? 
i 'm not ready yet . i got ta do this for a little while . 
i told you . i 'm like positive . 
well i 've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and i 'm still like this . they have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they 're in technicolor . 
how come i 'm still in black and white ? 
can i ask you a question ? 
gone out with you . she woulda like rearranged your tonsils . 
no . she really liked you . 
so what is it ? 
seemed kinda sexy . look . i read 35 pages . 
d.h. lawrence . you ever heard of him ? 
yeah . ca n't believe you started such a dorky fad . 
what 's wrong ? 
but like only up to the part about the raft because i did n't read any farther . 
okay look this like -- wasn't my fault . they asked me what it was about and i like did n't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade but i told them what i did remember and the next thing i knew the pages had filled in . 
um ... they like wanna ask you a question ... i did n't know how to handle it . so ... 
not directly anyhow ... 
i had nothing to do with that fire . 
me too . sounds swell . 
um -- hello ? you want to like take a look ? 
i mean you do n't think it 's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it .   oh god ! i am just so personally horrified right now ... 
david nobody 's happy in a poodle skirt and a sweater set .   you like all this do n't you ? 
well if i do n't who will ? 
well maybe it needs to be messed with . did that ever like -- occur to you ?   you know they do n't want to be like this it 's just that nobody ever helped them before . 
so what 's the big deal . oh . okay . they 're like not good at basketball anymore . like -- omigod what a tragedy . 
he - llo ? i 've got like three pounds of underwire here ... 
so what 's the point ? 
what do you mean ? 
i 've worn some kinky stuff before ... 
i could like kill a guy with these things . 
i like -- really need a cigarette too . 
just watch . you know why those guys just get cats out of trees ? 'cause nothing burns around here that 's why ! they do n't need any firemen ... 
i got lost .   oh here ... look at this ! 
i looked in the library . they got covers with nothing inside them . 
it 's too weird david . this place is giving me the creeps . did you know all the books are blank ? 
no way . 
can we do any better ? 
those are my friends . 
who 's that ? 
why ca n't we just explain it ? 
no ! i 'm not gon na do it ! if i do n't dress like this for mom i 'm sure as hell not going to do it for you ! 
play along ? 
okay now you listen to me ! i do n't know what 's going on but you 'd better fix it ! i had a date with mark davis and i even bought new underwear ! 
you know him ? 
we 're supposed to be at home david ! we 're supposed to be in color !   oh god ... 
i still do n't see why we 're doing this . 
all that animal fat . i feel it in my pores or something . 
i 'm gon na hurl david . i swear to god . 
neither do i. 
what 's going to happen ? 
uchh ! look at me ? ! i 'm like so ... pasty ! 
what did you do ?

you ca n't be late . 
what time are you gon na be there ? 
right now you 're doing nothing ? 
what are you doing ? 
are you going to the party tonight ? 
what are you doing ? 
if you 're going to slander him then you do n't deserve to hear his stories -- 
he 's a writer not a madman . 
once or twice . 
no one 's forcing you to listen . 
do n't come any closer abbe . god 's watching . 
you 'll hate me now wo n't you ? 
what ? what 've i done ? 
why not ? 
mother 's not half so blind as you . 
it 's a sin against god for me to refuse your kindness . but my heart 's held fast here ... 
do n't turn us out abbe . 
i 've you to look after me have n't i ? 
i have n't been to see the marquis for ages . and i wo n't -- ever again -- i swear it . i wo n't speak to him i wo n't even utter his name -- 
he 's not the man who 's cast a shadow here . 
if i was n't such a bad woman on the page abbe i 'll hazard i could n't be such a good woman in life . 
i put myself in his stories . i play the parts . each strumpet each murderess . 
it 's a hard day 's wages slaving away for madmen . what i 've seen in life it takes a lot to hold my interest . 
do n't say that ; reading 's my salvation . 
i was wrong to free him but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink -- 
his stinking breath caused my eyes to run that 's all . 
yes abbe ? 
then how can we know who is truly good and who is evil ? 
it 's because of the marquis is n't it ? 
i 'm only a laundress ; not a detective . 
it 's not your cup of tea mama . 
... yes i 've got that bit ... 
a tale more horrible than all the rest combined ! 
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet ! there armed with a quill of my own i 'll commit it to paper ! 
tomorrow night whisper a new tale to your neighbor cleante . he 'll whisper it to his neighbor dauphin who 'll whisper it to his neighbor franval -- 
yes ; that 's it ! a final volley from us both ! 
you could whisper it through the walls of your cell . 
it need n't be ; not if you 've another story . 
he 's a man of god ; he 's true to his vows . 
the abbe 's sending me away . he fears for me here what with the likes of you -- 
i must say in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations . 
it 's only been described to me . in your books . 
they 've taken your clothes ? 
i do n't believe it ! 
what have they done to you now ? 
what 's that then ? 
you demand a lot from your readers you do . 
it 's a long story this one . 
oh you . you talk same as you write . 
must i administer them directly or might i blow them ? 
is it terribly erotic ? 
is it awfully violent ? 
your publisher says i 'm not to leave without a new manuscript . 
there 's something else i want from you . 
i put myself at life and limb . surely that 's worth a few louis . 
i suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours . 
you ? frighten me ? that 's a good one ! i 'm twice as fast as you are . who 'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind ? 
do n't start -- 
and why not ? my fortune siphoned away . my reputation past repair . i 've nothing left to lose .   silence my husband or you 'll come to know an infamy to rival his own . 
public scorn carries a terrible sting . trust me . i 'm a woman who knows . 
am i a cursed woman doctor ? must i be betrayed by every man i meet -- 
if only you 'd remained true to our contract ! opiates for his nerves ! restraints ! the man warrants a bed of nails -- 
i 'm on the brink of bankruptcy ; my husband 's resources are all but exhausted . and to what end i ask you ? 
once ... long ago ... in the folly of youth ... he made me love him . 
doctor ... can i impart to you his cruelest trick ? 
i am eternally in your debt . 
do n't toy with me doctor . 
it 's beyond perversity . that honor should carry a price tag ... 
oh but i am ! 
what thought is that ? 
it 's tainted money doctor . 
i am not a wealthy woman . 
i pay his stipend every month far more dutifully than i should . 
oh you do do you ? it is my dearest hope doctor that he remain entombed forever and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms . 
you 're new to charenton yes ? perhaps you 're not yet familiar with my husband and his unusual case . 
i beg to differ doctor . you work in a madhouse . your every waking moment is governed by the insane . 
desperation has driven me past etiquette all the way to frenzy . 
he refuses to be seen in my company ! he blanches at the mention of your name -- 
give me back my anonymity that 's all i ask ! let me be invisible again ! 
everywhere i go they point and whisper ! at the opera they hiss at me when i take my box . when i went to church ... the priest refused to even hear my confession ; he said i was already damned ! why must i suffer for your sins ? 
you ought to court the doctor 's favor not his contempt . 
to flaunt your deviance in public ? upon a stage ? 
i beg you donatien ... as your wife ... your only ally ... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself . 
how was i to know my darling ? 
forgive me i beg you -- 
.... shame on you truly ... 
she knew what she was signing on for after all she took the money . 
do n't insult me with your cute press quotes save it for louella . 
we 've known each other too long orson . sling the bullshit elsewhere . 
of being found out . of not being a genius 
you 're just scared . 
it 's gon na be fine orson . you 're gon na do great . 
so you ever gon na do a picture ? 
last week would this be ? 
marion everyone knows you 're not like that--

you need to get outta here rapunzel 
houdini mice . 
but i am that 's the killer honey . 
the character that 's supposed to be me susan alexander-- 
you know this citizen kane picture ? about pops and everything ? 
yeah . but all of a sudden it 's not 
thing that bothers me now though looking back is that i really think i could have been something ... special . 
i did my best but well you know me 
when i met him i was just 20 . and he was 55 . i saw the gold ring and just grabbed on . and he was going to make me a star . 
he needs me here . 
i ca n't 
and attractive in a hammy sort of way . 
mr. welles certainly is a caution 
it 's not so bad here . after all what girl does n't want to live in a castle ? 
with about twenty of his spies on my tail . no thanks . 
that 's why he has the parties he says it 's like bringing the world to me . 
god these parties are the worst 
and we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t - t- teeth and i 'm just imagining plague lice jumpin ' all over the damn place so we set t - t - traps everywhere . and every morning we would find the t - t - traps sprung but no mice ! 
i do n't want you to-- 
i just want to understand-- 
fuck you mr. kane . 
tough shit . we need to t - t - talk about this-- 
you will not walk out on me 
but why ? just so you can show it all off -- just so everyone can see what a b - b - big man you are ? ! 
there 's a different between want and 
did you need it ? did you need any of it ? 
i know where deauville is for c - c - christ 's sake . 
that -- did you need that ? how much did that cost ? 
you do n't need it ! that 's the problem you always think you need everything-- 
you do n't have any money left okay ? ! that 's the truth . i do n't wanna say it nobody else will say it but it 's the truth . you spent it all . you ca n't buy the tribune in chicago -- you ca n't buy ^ g - g- goddamn thing . now you better face up to it-- 
you got ta wake up now . pops . 
i 'm not asking you to defend anything . but we 're in a pickle and we got ta talk about it . 
a million dollars a year on art and st - st - statues and there 's nothing to explain ? ! 
then you explain it to me ? ! 
i am not that woman . 
bought and p - p - paid for . just like one of his goddamn statues . well at least in the movie he married her ! 
nailed us hub ? the crazy old man and his whore . 
well -- he got us did n't he ? she stands and goes quickly to pour a drink . a forced laugh 
how does one get 125 million dollars in debt ? 
we 're 125 million dollars in debt ? 
how much ? 
how much ? 
how bad is it ? 
you oughta lay off him -- he is the p - p - president after all . 
nuts . she only cares about the money . she thinks i 'll make you cut her out of the w - w - w - w ...   will . 
there . that 's right . 
this is supposed ta be siam or some such . some kinda lousy b - b - balinese temple . this look like a temple to you ? i ca n't see it myself-- 
there certainly is i there certainly is ! aw to hell with you ! 
goddamn it . i got ta have some kinda life ! 
as i said i have some j - j - j - j-   that i might wish t - t - to sell and i wanted an estimate-- 
thank you -- b - b - but i 'd really like t - t - to-- 
i um need an estimate on some jewelry i might wish to sell . but d - d - discretion is very important to me b - b - because i do n't want anyone t - t - to um know that-- 
ca n't you get the money from your friends ? 
jake be careful ! what 're you doing to the belt ? ! 
but they do n't have a case against you . 
what are you doing ? 
all right just do n't make any noise . 
the kids are sleeping . 
are you drunk ? 
i 'm sick of it . i ca n't watch you this way . you 're too drunk all the time . there 's too many girls . i ca n't ... i do n't wanna talk about it . i made up my mind . 
i got a lawyer jake . we 're getting a divorce . i 'm getting custody of the kids . 
no . i wo n't talk to you where you can use your hands on me . 
no . this time it 's true . i did n't bother to tell you until i had everything worked out . 
i 'm leaving you jake . 
tell him how you feel -- you miss him . tell him you 're sorry . 
why do n't you just call him ? 
i do n't know . 
no not that . 
why do n't you just call him up ? 
i want to say something to you without you blowing your stack . 
jake why do n't you just try lying down and get some rest . 
you know if there 's one thing -- i just do n't understand you not one single little bit . you love me ? 
you 're not only an animal you 're a stupid animal .   you 're rotten .   rotten .   rotten .   you 're a sick maniac . a maniac ! you belong in a mental hospital . 
nothing is what i said ! go on kill me .   kill me .   i 'm not afraid of you anymore . i do n't care if you kill me like you 're killing him . you 're a sick animal . 
you 're killing him . you 're killing him for nothing . stop it .

i did n't do anything wrong . i swear . i just had a few drinks . 
jake no -- 
i am answering ... 
what 're you talking about ? 
oh c'm on . for christsake do i have to tell you everything ? 
i went to the movies . 
i got bored so i went to the movies . 
i took the kids to my sister 's . 
i went out . 
what 's the matter with you ? 
but jake ... i did n't say anything ... 
you 're hurting my arm . 
all i did ... 
what did i do ? 
i never noticed his face . 
what did i say ? 
nobody . i love you remember ? 
yeah what ? 
jake c'm on now . do n't start . 
no i 'm not . 
i 'm not interested in him . 
no i 'm not . i 'm looking at you . 
i was just ... 
but jake i was just ... 
well he 's popular . a lotta people like janiro . you beat him and it only figures they 'll wanna see you get a title shot . but what do i know ? i should keep my mouth shut i should ... 
joey 's right . janiro 's up - and coming he 's good looking ... 
oh jake . 
i like the gym smell . 
jake you made me promise not to get you excited . 
you said i could n't . you 've been good for two weeks ... 
you said never to touch you before a fight . 
are you sure we should be doing this ? 
jake this is your father 's bedroom . 
what does that mean ? 
can you see it ? 
i ca n't find my ball . 
should i hit it ? 
it feels real good . 
you go first . let me watch how to do this . 
i ai n't no movie star . i 'm just in high school . 
you do n't talk very much . 
i do n't know . 'cause you 're cute . 
i just wanted to say hello . 
and i 'm gon na finish my drink . and i 'm gon na have a good time because i ai n't doing nothing wrong . 
that 's right take his part . you 're his brother . he 's never gon na be champ . too many people are against him . 
you do n't sleep with him . i do . i do n't get to breathe without tellin ' him . he keeps me in a cage . if he thinks i 'm lookin ' at somebody the wrong way i get used as a punching bag . he do n't trust nobody . if he saw the two of us talking together right now you 'd be in trouble too -- believe me . look at me joey . i 'm 19 years old . i wanna enjoy my life . i love jake but you do n't know . he gets crazy sometimes . i 'm scared . 
well go ahead tell jake . he 's gon na kill me anyway . it 's a matter of time . 
i 'm not doing anything wrong . i 'm just trying to have a good time . do i have to be cooped up in the house all the time ? 
what the hell am i doing wrong ? just because jake is training i ca n't go out ? what am i a goddamn prisoner ? 
i would say that is looked as if she was n't coming back . 
did n't you take it to the crime lab ? 
of course it 's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope . 
like disposing of their wives ? 
it was in her favorite handbag -- and mr. doyle that can lead to only one conclusion . 
shut up . i 'm all right . 
get an ambulance .   do n't move . try to lie still . 
shall we vote him in stella ? 
what for ? 
jeff if you 're squeamish just do n't look . 
and the last thing she 'd leave behind would be her wedding ring !   do you ever leave yours at home ? 
was n't that close ? 
it could be -- the knife and the saw . 
it 's just a picture of the backyard that 's all . 
is he cleaning house ? 
but you 're not ? 
do you like it ? 
i 'll rephrase the question . 
did mr. doyle think i stole this case . 
you and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man did n't kill his wife . we 're two of the most frightening ghouls i 've ever known . 
jeff -- if anybody walked in here i do n't think they 'd believe what they see . 
i 'm not much on rear window ethics . 
i hate funny exit lines . 
exactly what i had in mind -- along with some brandy . 
weird .   why do n't i slip into something comfortable ? 
the same . 
surprise -- is the most important element of attack .   and beside you 're not up on your private eye literature . when they 're in trouble it 's always their girl friday who gets them out of it . 
i do ? 
it 's utterly beautiful .   i wish i could be creative . 
i 'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night . 
a mark cross overnight case anyway . compact but ample enough . 
you said i 'd have to live out of one suitcase   i 'll bet yours is n't this small ? 
say anything else and i 'll stay tomorrow night too . 
i have the whole weekend off . 
night . i 'm going to stay with you . 
do n't rush me . we have all night . 
i 'd like to see your friend 's face when we tell him . he does n't sound like much of a detective . 
we 'll agree they saw a woman -- but she was n't mrs. thorwald . -- that is yet . 
well i have a pat rebuttal for mr. doyle -- that could n't be mrs. thorwald -- or i do n't know women . 
that mrs. thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband ? 
basic equipment . you do n't leave it behind in your husband 's drawer in your favorite handbag . 
they do not ! and they do n't leave it behind them . a woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup perfume and jewelry . 
but only her husband would know that .   and the jewelry ! women do n't keep all their jewelry in a purse all tangled getting scratched and twisted up . 
a woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it . then she takes a trip and leaves it behind . why ? 
women are n't that unpredictable . 
it does n't make sense to me . 
and you and you friend doyle --   did you hear from him again -- since he left ? 
all day long i 've tried to keep my mind on work . 
well i guess it 's safe to put on some lights now . 
suppose he does n't come back again ? 
i wonder where he 's going now ? 
someone not his wife ? 
what about it ? 
it does n't seem to be in any hurry . 
all right -- but what 's he doing now ? 
okay chief . what 's my next assignment . 
125 west ninth street . 
the name on the second floor rear mailbox reads mr. and mrs. lars that 's l - a - r - s lars thorwald . 
do n't you see how silly you 're being ? 
and that 's where you 're not being clever . he would n't parade his crime in front of the open shades . 
jeff do you think a murderer would let you see all that ? that he should n't keep his shades down and hide behind them ? 
you could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up and walked along the corridor and the streets and the backyard ? 
you could see all the things he did could n't you ? 
maybe he 's leaving his wife . i do n't know and i do n't care . lots of people have saws knives and ropes around their houses . lots of men do n't speak to their wives all day . lots of wives nag and men hate them and trouble starts -- but very very very few of them end up in murder -- if that 's what you 're thinking . 
there 's nothing to see . 
she could be under sedatives sleeping .   he 's in the room now . 
maybe she died . 
a lot of things . she 's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day . 
what makes you think something 's wrong with her ? 
what is it you 're looking for ? 
i do n't know what you consider it -- but if you do n't stop it i 'm getting out of here . 
sitting around looking out a window to kill time is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --   -- with with binoculars and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is is diseased ! 
jeff -- if you could only see yourself . 
something too frightful to utter . 
i would n't dare answer that . 
nothing thank heaven . 
homework . it 's more interesting . 
he likes the way his wife welcomes him home . 
tell me about it . 
i have one now . 
your mind is . and when i want a man i want all of him . 
without any future ? 
i mean what i said . 
not quite -- it seems .   goodbye jeff . 
and it 's deflating to find out that the only way i can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine . i guess i 'm not the girl i thought i was . 
you do n't think either one of us could ever change ? 
jeff you do n't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me i 'm wrong . 
oh i do that all the time . whenever i have a few minutes after lunch . 
of course not . 
you ca n't fit in here -- i ca n't fit in there . according to you people should be born live an die on the same -- 
it 's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special private little group of anointed people . 
what is it but traveling from one place to another taking pictures ? it 's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation . 
it does n't make sense to me . what 's so different about it here from over there or any place you go that one person could n't live in both places just as easily ? 
if you 're saying all this just because you do n't want to tell me the truth because you 're hiding something from me then maybe i can understand -- 
almost as if it were being written especially for us . 
i think it 's enchanting . 
you said it resembled my apartment did n't you ? 
she 's not in love with him -- or any of them . 
oh ? you can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street ? 
i could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit . 
do n't laugh . -- i could do it ! 
for yourself -- and me .   i could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow ... fashion portraits -- 
make the one you want . 
jeff -- is n't it time you came home ? you could pick your assignment . 
someday you might want to open up your own studio here . 
you ca n't buy that kind of publicity . 
she looked very cool . she had on a mint green -- 
what a day i 've had ! 
well i 'm going to make this a week you 'll never forget . 
i could n't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you 've been through . and the last week must be the hardest . 
big enough ? 
i wanted to jeff .   oh ! 
it 's cracked -- and you never use it . and it 's too ornate . i 'm sending up a plain flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved . 
it 's opening night of the last depressing week of l. b. jefferies in a cast . 
going on right here . it 's a big night . 
we sell a dozen a day in this price range . 
-- a steal at eleven hundred dollars . 
only because it 's expected of her . 
anything else bothering you ? 
and you love life ? 
and your stomach ? 
how 's your leg ? 
when those cops get a look at miss fremont -- they 'll even contribute . 
i got twenty or so in my purse . give me what you 've got . 
ten here . 
how much do you think you 'll need ? 
what do you need money for ? 
unless he 's dumber than i think he wo n't wait ' til his lease is up . 
when you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this ? 
smart ? she 'll be arrested ! 
what 's she trying to do ? why does n't she turn him in ? 
you know miss fremont -- he might just have something there . 
there 's probably one in the basement . 
got a shovel ? 
you know ? you might not be too bad a bargain for lisa after all . 
no -- but it makes the rest easy to take . and she 's reading the bible . 
i handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in new jersey asleep for the winter . 
miss lonely hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules . 
i wonder . 
thank heaven that 's over ! 
you should n't have let her do that ! if he ever -- 
there 's something buried there . 
you mean the one the dog was sniffing around ? 
mrs. thorwald ? 
i 'm just going to get the name of their truck ! 
you called the police ? 
goodbye mr. jefferies . i 'll see you tomorrow . 
i 'm not shy . i 've been looked at before . 
a federal offense . 
in this heat ?   they 're up now . 
what about this morning ? any developments ? 
but it takes a particularly low type of man to do it . 
his personal effects . he 's probably running away -- the coward . 
flashlights . luminous dials for watches . house numbers that light up . 
is n't he a salesman ? 
he and his wife splitting up ? 
is n't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction ? 
poor girl . someday she 'll find her happiness . 
and she 'll end up fat alcoholic and miserable . 
keep your mind off her . 
what 'll you do if one of them catches you ? 
eyes bloodshot . must have been staring out the window for hours . 
the insurance company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed not the wheelchair . 
okay -- but i 'm going to spread some common sense on the bread . lisa fremont 's loaded to her fingertips with love for you . i 'll give you two words of advice . marry her . 
when i married myles we were both maladjusted misfits . we still are . and we 've loved every minute of it . 
ask for trouble and you get it . why there 's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years . then he refused to marry her . why ? -- because she only scored sixty - one on a look magazine marriage quiz ! 
baloney ! once it was see somebody get excited get married -- now it 's read books fence with four syllable words psychoanalyze each other until you ca n't tell a petting party from a civil service exam 
intelligence ! nothing has caused the human race more trouble . modern marriage ! 
look mr. jefferies . i 'm not educated . i 'm not even sophisticated . but i can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on broadway . not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle . 
you 're never going to marry ? 
people with sense can belong wherever they 're put . 
is what you want something you can discuss ? 
she 's only perfect . 
it 's happened before you know ! some of the world 's happiest marriage have started ' under the gun ' you might say . 
her father loading up the shotgun ? 
behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause .   what is it ? you have a fight ? 
nonsense . a man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl . and lisa fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain who can get one eye open . 
that 's abnormal . 
that 's normal . 
you must be kidding . a beautiful young woman and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood . 
gives your circulation something to fight .   what kind of trouble ? 
i knew it ! 
those sultry sun - worshipers you watch have n't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks . 
you 've got a hormone deficiency . 
it crashed did n't it ? 
i predicted it . 
well i only quote from the best . 
good luck buzz . 
feel okay ? 
buzzie -- we better get out of here . 
i heard about it .   you 're lucky he lived . 
i 'm glad they let you out . 
a new disease . 
steady marlon ! 
they 're killing him ! 
you should have heard him talk about you tonight .   like you were the hero in the china seas . 
he needed you maybe .   so do i. 
after he tried to shoot you ? 
we have to go back ! 
i love you jim .   i really mean it . 
i love somebody .   all the time i 've been looking for someone to love me and now -- i love somebody .   and it 's so easy .   why is it easy now ? 
i never felt so clean before . 
you smell like baby powder . 
funny jimmy .   you 're so clean and you -- this is silly . 
is this what it 's like to love somebody ? 
i know already .   we do n't have to pretend now . 
you do n't need to do that . 
are you ? 
i do n't know -- you just are . leaving a light for plato .   that was nice . 
your hand 's all wet and it 's shaky .   you 're so funny . 
i do n't know . 
not exactly .   it 's certainly huge . 
you ca n't talk underwater ! 
see we 're very modern . 
there 's just one thing .   what about-- 
you see we 've just -- oh you tell him darling .   i 'm so embarrassed i could die ! 
you decide darling .   remember our budget . 
oh jim ! 
i feel as if i 'm walking under water . 
i 'm never going back . 
i do n't know but we ca n't stay here . 
your lips are soft when you kiss . 
why did you do that ? 
so have i.   but i 've never been in love .   is n't that awful ? 
have you ever gone with anyone who-- 
if you knew me you would n't say that . 
i 'm sorry i treated you mean today . you should n't believe what i say when i 'm with the kids .   nobody acts sincere . 
neither can i. 
even if i 'm near a fire i 'm cold . i guess just about everybody 's cold . 
i 'm numb . 
no -- i was just -- maybe-- 
it does n't matter to them . 
they 'll be looking for you . 
goodbye !   see you ! 
i 'll bet you 're a real yo yo . 
the kids take me . 
university and 10th -- want to carry my books ? 
dig the square wardrobe ! 
you going there ? 
wo n't mother be proud . 
who lives ? 
where what was . 
now that 's true ! 
bully for you . 
hi plato ! 
it 's all right . 
plato where 's your father now ? 
talk to them !   heavens ! 
yes .   and so terribly annoying when they cry .   i just do n't know what to do when they cry do you dear ? 
oh we can manage that !   i 'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone ... 
want to finish my hamburger ?   i only took a bite . 
well that 's the main thing -- don't you think so ? 
what 's he like ? 
is he your friend ? 
you said you 'd call my father . 
my mother ? 
you know where they picked me up ! twelfth street !   i was n't even near there ! 
i 'll never get close to anybody . 
no .   i do n't even know why i do it . 
i was just talking a walk .   i tried to call the kids but everybody was out and i could n't find them .   i hate my life .   i just hate it . 
yes -- he started yelling for a handkerchief -- screaming .   he grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off -- he rubbed till i thought i would n't have any lips left .   and all the time yelling at me -- that thing -- the thing i told you he called me .   then i ran out of the house . 
yes !   i do n't know !   i mean maybe he does n't mean it but he acts like he does .   we 're altogether and we 're going to celebrate easter and catch a double bill .   big deal .   so i put on my new dress and i came out and he-- 
he calls me a dirty tramp -- my own father ! 
i do n't think .   i know .   he looks at me like i 'm the ugliest thing in the world .   he does n't like my friends -- he-- 
he hates me . 
he hates me . 
girls do n't love their father ? since when ?   since i got to be sixteen ? 
i guess i just do n't understand anything . 
i was talking to dad . 
i did n't want to stop . 
did n't you forget something ? 
good evening . 
nothing only it 'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change . 
are you and mom home tonight ? 
but the same song .   i think it 's fantastic ! 
how did you know that ? 
is he there ? 
open it . 
i still think you should go down . 
are you going down there ? 
i do n't know .   first i thought it was jim but-- 
frank ?   i 'm frightened . 
that 's right ! 
are you going to preach now ?   are we going to have a sermon ? 
i guess when i nearly died giving birth to you -- that shows how much i do n't care ! 
a minute ago you said you did n't care if he drinks . 
i was talking to jim . 
ca n't you answer ?   what 's the matter with you anyhow ? 
really frank ?   when was that ? 
jimmy you 're very young -- and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life . 
do i have to spell it out ? 
well it does n't matter anyhow-- because we 're moving . 
he 's not saying that !   he 's saying do n't volunteer ! 
no !   i do n't want you to go to the police !   there were other people and why should you be the only one involved ! 
why should you be the only one . 
what about the other boys -- do you think they 'll go to the police ? 
good lord ! 
and you wanted him to make a list ! 
do you enjoy doing this to me or what-- 
what happened darling .   we were so worried .   i was going to take a sleeping pill but i would n't till i knew you were home . 
goodbye dear . 
sit down and eat -- you'll be late . 
all right darling . 
that 's a fine way to behave ! 
mmm baby . and i 'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree ... 
he 's shown us the setup he 's drawn us the map he 's helped us do the plan . he wants a gun give him a gun . take the bullets out whatever but give him the gun . the more manpower we 've got in there the better . he wo n't try and make his move till the money 's in hand . 
what he should see me help you catch him ? 
did n't have to hit me so fucking hard . did n't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck . 
one more day baby . one more day to christmas . 
-- plus the forty to mason ... how many letters is that ?

we 're gon na get out of here nick . we 're gon na get out of this ... 
they 're truck drivers .

they run routes mostly east retail stuff warehouses . but gabriel knows some guys in new york miami guys he helps get guns to detroit . hides 'em with his regular loads . 
not without you .

then he shoulda signed his name . 
i 'm talking about the heart nick . i 'm not talking about the words . 
yes it was all you -- 
not bad . just regular .   you wrote me wonderful things nick . personal things . 
all the guys i 've ever been with ... they never want to know me . who i am on the inside . they just want to qet inside . when they do they think that means they know who i am . that i trust them . that they know me . that there 's nothing left to learn .   a guy like you nick -- six months before you can even touch my face . i figure a guy in that kind of bind he 's gon na hafta work to get to know me some other way . 
i told you nick . remember ? 
well . you 're not the first guy i wrote to . but you 're the only one i kept writing to . 
go to hell nick mason what 's that supposed to mean -- 
no c'm on -- 
no no no . be like you want to be . 
thought you wrote you had a mustache . 
you are to me . 
saw me -- 
saw my outfit or something my coat -- 
i figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way -- 
radio said . 
radio said negative five . 
i have n't got the job yet . 
to the other side of the street . 
thanks for loading me on the stage . i know now why you did it . 
by the way if you ever go past the wyatt ranch have another talk with elaine . 
goodbye . thanks for the lift . 
i 'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will . somebody who wants me as i am will maybe walk into the place where i 'm working and take me out of there . 
i ca n't change either . not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand . 
some of 'em you did n't mean but most of 'em you did . i do n't blame you because i understand your way of thinking and why you think that way . you want your women on pedestals . but they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they ca n't climb back up . 
fine -- maybe i 'll see you there sometime . 
maybe it is n't going to sonora but it 's going somewhere which is all right with me . 
i wo n't have you fighting over me . 
if you want to go on i can make it all right . 
go on take it . then you ca n't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid . 
all my clothes -- 
no i 'm not all right . i 'm soaked and i hit myself against that rock . 
then let 's get started . the sooner i get to sonora the better i 'll like it . 
save 'em for the girl in gingham . just tell me i 'm not good enough for you . go on . say a woman like me ca n't change . 
i 'm awake now . go on . say what you want to say . i 'll listen . 
i do n't expect anything . a minute ago i had n't cuite waked up . 
what does a man usually tell a girl ? 
tell me darling . 
you do n't mean that clay . 
you should have . i do n't like leaving things unfinished . 
yes . but -- that was the other night . now -- i do n't think i would . 
so that 's it --   you think i was making fun of your girl in gingham . 
i do n't know . i thought i did . now i 'm not sure . i thought it had something to do with me . 
why did you change your mind about bringing us along ? 
do n't you trust me ? 
you 're not going out to look for them ? 
are we leaving ? 
he knows his alphabet . 
blonde as a new mop . and beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar . 
but the rest is right . 
she wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples . 
ever since you 've looked after steve you 've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass good water barn corral and house --- that part you 've shared with steve . the girl in gingham you plan sneakin ' in when he is n't looking . 
you should know . she 's in your dream . 
you 've earned it -- the horse ranch on the toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham . 
i hope you get everything you want out of life -- 
you could have treated us like they did in aspen . no . you would n't do a thing like that -- it is n't in you to be mean or cruel . 
you do n't have to explain . did i tell you how grateful i am for what you 've done ? 
i suppose it is . 
no thanks .   i hope we wo n't be a burden to them . 
we ca n't stay here ! 
i did n't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded . i could n't leave her in the street . let 's go . 
so that was why she tried to run away . 
can we get a doctor at that ranch ? 
they 're stragglin ' . 
learnin ' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street . 
he 's learning his letters . 
like what ? 
that why you always took him on the other side of the street ? 
there 's a nice boy . 
would you mr. phillips ? 
if you were in his shoes would you take one of us home ? 
and look at it this way . how about jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot . 
where do you keep the can opener ? 
but you eat do n't you ? 
thanks . and is n't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds ? 
so am i. 
and this is helen carter . 
too much excitement . or maybe it 's just the heat . how about the surrey . can you fix it ? 
our kind of women ? 
we have to get to sonora . there are jobs waiting for us there . we 'll pay you for your trouble . 
what good is it going to do us to go to some ranch ? 
you ca n't leave us here . 
they wo n't be riding in the wagon . 
as far as -- sonora ? 
and this is helen carter . 
it was a gift from the citizens of aspen . i 'm mary wells . 
too much excitement . how about the surrey . can you fix it ? 
no . we came down the hill a little fast and ...   ... the wheel broke .   can you fix it for us ? 
goodbye and thanks . 
we tried to point that out . but there were some pretty nosey citizens who would n't listen to reason . they said aspen had outgrown us . it 's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon . 
aspen does n't want us mr. graham . they threw us out . 
thank you mr. graham . 
not exactly . they decided gambling and dancing were bad for people .   can i make it ? 
until you came along we were going to sonora . 
i do n't care what he thinks . 
that 's it then . 
-- gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar . cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing . what do you think of that ? 
give it back to him . we 're leavin ' . 
we might as well start a fire . 
what 's the use . 
you 'd think he 'd do it for elaine 's sake at least ... 
how many ways can a man say no . 
he certainly could . about a month . 
no we do n't . but that 's where we 're going . from minden we take a stage to reno then another one over to auburn and another one to placerville . then it 's a day 's trip to sonora . 
until pa gets around to driving us to minden . 
there 's still tomorrow morning . 
i tried my best but these things take time . 
that 's not what 's worryin ' me . why did n't she tell us ? maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin ' a poor sick kid through this -- 
why did n't you say you wanted to get married back in aspen . i told the man in sonora there were four of us . if only three show up he might call the whole deal off . we 've got to stick together . like we 've always done . 
now where 's she goin' ? -- 
maybe in sonora . 
if you need me i 'll be -- 
thanks steve . 
for the last ten miles i 've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up . i 'm getting to the point where i do n't think there 's any place named sonora . 
let me do that . 
she was only teasin ' . 
but you 're his brother . 
you were supposed to be reading words . 
and you 've got me all figured out ? 
oh i was n't worrying .   i saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave . 
well steve ? 
you do n't read to fill your stomach ... poetry for instance . all the poems in the world would n't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good . 
kind of tough i guess ... but you 're not liable to hunt them -- i do n't think there 's any alive now anyways -- and i 'm not sure but i do n't think there ever were ... 
would they be good to eat ? 
hmmm ... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead . 
unicorn -- a kind of animal -- 
there 's plenty of use for reading -- you 'll see . 
without someone to teach you it 's tough . 
from a to z. all you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words . 
that 's the end of the line . 
no . we 're not stayin ' -- 
do n't be silly ... nobody 's too old to learn . 
why not ? you went farther than that last time . 
good night steve . 
did someone say i was n't nice ? 
maybe i could start you out . 
would you like to learn them ? 
do n't you even know your letters ? 
but he just never troubled to have you get any schooling ? 
your brother 's always looked after you has n't he ? 
is that your kind of reading steve ? 
i was at first . then i was hanging on .   are you going far ? 
there there . do n't you upset yourself -- 
that 's right -- you go back to sleep . tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different . do n't you worry about anything -- mary 's going to talk things over with your folks -- 
darling -- now i 've got you all upset . 
not if i know mary . when she rides into sonora you 'll be with her . and mighty glad to be there after this . i do n't see how you stood it as long as you did . 
drink this and stop being silly . why would anyone want to live in this place . you might as well be dead and buried . nothing to do but look at mountains . in a week you 'd be talking to yourself .   maybe that 's what got you started in the first place . 
do n't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here . 
if you 're worried about mary and me talkin ' too much do n't . no matter how many questions your old man asks . we know how to keep our mouths shut . 
he wo n't take us .   do n't you want us around ? 
well cheer why do n't you ? no more responsibilities mary . marcia -- elaine -- me -- all taken care of . down there feeding horses and raising kids you wo n't have a thing to worry about . 
you 're sure there 's more where this came from ? 
then why stay in the hills . 
i like it . 
you would n't have a smoke on you would you ? 
the way you act it must be something pretty secret . 
what is it ? 
that something i should n't see ? 
me snoopin ' ? i came down here to take a bath . 
mary honey . i talked too much like always -- he thinks you told elaine the things i told her . 
i 'm sure of this . but not of you .   you wo n't open any joint . i 've been watching you change . you 're mad now and you think you can change back . but you ca n't . you 'll end up making beds in a boarding house . 
sounds fine . only that is n't how it 's going to be . 
maybe you are . i 'm not . 
go ahead .   get in training for the pioneer life . i 'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it . 
please . maybe he 'll take a good look at you and stop thinking so much about his horses . 
go on . have another try at him . 
maybe i better start working on him . 
you 're not giving up ? 
what are you waiting for ? do something . 
clay could save us an awful lot of time . 
we do n't want to go there . 
how long do you think we 'll have to stay here ? 
and we 're running out of that . 
quit worryin ' about elaine . 
it is n't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of . 
with a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other . 
you think that 's all we busted -- you should see ... 
maybe you 're going about this all wrong . why not try telling him we 'll do the cookin ' and mendin ' and washin ' for him . that usually works .   yeah but suppose he took us up on it . where would we be ? 
i do n't know -- i do n't know . 
up the trail . 
clay phillips . 
stop it -- 
everybody knows -- 
alex what are you doing ? 
i think he wants me . 
i found a picture of his wife . 
brenda was right . there 's more to the story than the professor told us . i found a secret room . it had all these news clippings about hugh kane . he was a very evil man . 
no i have n't dated in a while . my last boyfriend 's ...

mrs. ackerman when you left me at the flea - market where did you go ? 
ewwww !   thank you rosemary . 
you want me to keep that under the table for you ? 
did you find your franklin mint egg rosemary darling ? 
i 'm not that bad a driver .   look at her hair !   turn it off honey .

rosemary honey . good morning . i 'm fine .   thanks for remembering .

you could go and open the door . 
it 's only a little way mr. august . 
which room is it ? 
if my sister 's in that room it wo n't make any difference about warrants- and things i want to go there . 
can we go there now ? 
you think my sister is there ? 
why would mrs. redi lie to me ? 
yes . she bought my sister 's business . 
mr. august i 'm not at all sure - 
i have n't any money but i 'll get a job and -- 
you can ? 
what is it ? 
do you know what this is frances ? 
thank you . 
it always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy . 
what does she do with herself after business hours ? 
she seems rather an odd woman to me . 
is mrs. redi nice to work for ? 
but i like teaching school . 
i 'll try there . 
i ca n't understand it at all . 
i know . for the first time i 'm beginning to be frightened . i almost feel as if i 'd never known my sister . 
i do n't know . that 's why i came to see mrs. redi . i 'm trying to find her . 
hello frances . 
no i 'm glad .... at least i 've heard you say it ... 
i 've never loved any one before gregory and i do love you - you must know it -- but jacqueline 's my sister  whom i had lost and have found again ....    
gregory    you 'd better take jacqueline with you tonight . 
good night . 
you 'd love that jackie . remember that last summer with mother in the berkshires ? you used to help the gardener . 
it will all be over in such a little while jacqueline and everything will be all right again . drink your coffee . 
do n't . we know what happened . do n't go on . 
we 've tried so long to find her . 
what things ? why ? 
you could have told me any time you were jacqueline 's husband . 
a poet . he 's sitting right over there . that 's his table  the one at the feet of dante . 
last night in this very restaurant mr. jason hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear . 
greg it is n't a wild tale . it 's true . if there were only some way -- 
you 've never believed a word i told you about mr. august . 
  what have you done about irving august ? 
well i 'm glad you came to see me . 
what brought you down here greg ? 
maybe the romaris might have a room . they seem nice . 
i 'd like that . 
a job ? 
but you have treated me that way . 
he was a kind little man in his way  and i made him go down that hall into the darkness . i made him do it . 
i saw him on the floor . he was cut -   --here . the blood was running out . he was dead . i 'm sure of it . then on the subway i saw him  white  and the men holding him up between them . 
but you do believe me ? 
thank you .. .goodnight . 
but i reel guilty . it does n't seem right for me to enjoy myself with jacqueline gone . 
thank you . it was a lovely dinner . 
i 'm not a youngster . i can understand . 
were n't you afraid ? 
because i loved jacqueline i thought i knew her . today i found out such strange things frightening things . i saw a hangman 's noose that she had hanging - waiting  i feel as if i 'd never known her . 
then you know where jacqueline is ? 
no ... at the morgue they told me a mr. gregory ward had made inquiries about jacqueline . 
you 'll be all right ? 
if you get lonely go down and see mrs. romari . i told her you were staying with me . 
good - bye darling . i 'll only be gone until three . 
please jacqueline . 
i understand . 
i keep telling myself that . 
jacqueline . mr. romari phoned me . she went out this afternoon with two men he 'd never seen before . 
i ca n't find gregory . i 've been trying to find him . 
he 's jacqueline 's husband . i ca n't 
and gregory -- he loves her . 
i have to . it was irving august -- everything mrs. redi said - it fits in with what i saw - she even knew i 'd seen his body on the subway . 
jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man . 
it 's because of jacqueline  i ca n't go on looking for her -- 
do n't make me tell you jason . 
i have to go - 
jason i 'm going back to highcliffe . i came to say good - by . 
it 's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars -- 
but it 's a small room jason . 
i can imagine . 
devil worshippers ! 
it 's all clear to me now -- so clear . 
i 'm at sea jason . 
i do n't know . 
i do n't think that 's so revealing . 
but you 're always at the library . 
it 's terribly sweet of you jason . 
i want you to look for jacqueline . 
and you knew he 'd be here . 
at least you knew about dr. judd . 
were you going to make a suggestion ? 
would they hurt her ? 
it will be fun meeting gregory every night at the station . 
cloven hoof ? 
you know where she is ? 
dr. judd ? 
i do n't believe it . 
i ca n't give up looking for her mrs. redi no matter what you 're hinting at . 
i 'll be out in a minute . 
i 'm afraid not . 
i 'm stopping at the chatsworth . 
there 's nothing you can think of -- old letters anything that might give me some hint as to where i might find jacqueline ? 
i did n't know . 
mrs. redi there 's one thing -with jacqueline gone how do you carry on the business ? what do you do with the receipts ? how do you sign checks-- ? 
but you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister . 
could you let me see that room ? if it is hers there might be something there to help me find my sister . 
you mean she just came here rented the room locked it and left ? 
but she was here ? 
yes  yes if she made that much impression on you i 'm sure it was jacqueline . 
once you 'd seen my sister you 'd never forget her . 
but mrs. lowood i ca n't just stay here not knowing what 's happened to my sister . maybe if i went to new york -- if i saw mrs. redi myself -- 
of course . 
sometimes she can be quite careless . why do n't you try mrs. redi ? 
difficult ? has anything happened to jacqueline ? 
no mrs. lowood she does n't write often . 
what did he say ? 
she 's very beautiful . 
i thought you might know her . she was seen here about a week ago . her name is jacqueline gibson . 
i 'm worry to bother you . i want to ask you about my sister . 
i 'll be right back with mrs. wheeler . 
because i have something very important to do . 
children i want you to be very good and very quiet while i see mrs. wheeler a moment . she 's going to take over this class for a while . 
no nancy . you 've got to sleep two more minutes . 
sh - h - h nancy . the other children . 
i ought to know . 
the tip is anyhow . i like to work on your hair . 
i guess most people are . 
she 's a pretty good sort . 
redi 's all right . 
well if it 's fun for you it 's all right . i get a kick out of my work when the customers are n't too crabby . 
i ca n't see much fun in teaching school . why do n't you go into the beauty business . 
it 's on peary street . just ask the people who run it . they 'll remember her .   people who see miss jacqueline never forget her . 
nothing 's happened to her . it 's just that i ca n't understand her not getting in touch with you . 
i do n't get this . miss jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you - had your picture in her office . 
you mean miss jacqueline 's gone and you do n't know where she is ? 
how 's miss jacqueline ? 
why mary -- 
she showed me a drawing . 
no . she asked about the trademark . 
she was just asking about you - whether it was nice to work for you or not . 
i did her hair . 
this is the most amusing thing i have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it  your failure with jacqueline . has she returned to her husband ? 
but you have never liked jason . you always laughed at him - -quarreled with him -- 
this is incredible i it must be some sort of a joke . 
you 're even sentimental about it . what made you change your mind ? 
i never thought you did . 
we always knew you 'd come to us louis . 
is it about jacqueline ? 
you 're very flippant and perhaps wise but not wise enough to see the truth louis . 
no you draw no secrets from me as you drew them from jacqueline . you are not one of us yet . you 're clever louis but i recognize your interest in me for what it is worth . you are only curious . you have never loved a woman who had but one arm . 
life has betrayed us . we 've found there is no heaven on earth so we must worship evil for evil 's own sake . we 're not wicked . we commit no violence unless ... 
i was a great dancer ... 
are we ? i thought i was very gay . 
i 'm afraid you have mistaken my motive louis . i thought you might understand and sympathize . 
yes . there are certain punitive measures ... 
i have n't said anything of the sort . 
i always thought it was a more intimate relationship . 
because you are intelligent -- that 's why they sent me to you -- 
it seems right to us . 
one believes - it 's like any other religion ... 
it wo n't hurt . 
jacqueline you have spoken so often of ending it all i ca n't understand why this should be so difficult for you . you have only to drink a little . 
i know . you introduced jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell - 
we have n't even begun tea yet . 
i want to touch you . 
but why ca n't you just put it all behind you ? ca n't you just forget it ? all that stuff you did ? 
i want to know why you are the way you are ! 
you 're not answering me . 
why are you ashamed ? 
come on ! ! 
i do n't care . 
i 'm just going to keep asking until you answer . i 'm sure there 's plenty of tape . 
why not ? 
yeah you 're right . but i never claimed to know everything like you and have all these little theories . i 'm still learning i know that . but i do n't feel like i 've wasted time . if i had to go through my marriage to get to where i am right now fine . 
oh you just moved here to think about it right ? 
whoa ! ! i 'm so glad we got that on tape ! ! you wo n't answer a question about elizabeth but i have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life ! ! graham what do you think she 's going to make of all these videotapes ? are you going to tell her about them ? i ca n't imagine her being too understanding about that . but since you do n't lie anymore you 'll have to say something . 
look at you look at what 's happened to you look how you 've changed ! do n't you think she will have changed ? 
graham i mean what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her ? 
like maybe a big part ? 
but that was part of it ? 
wait a minute wait a minute . what 's going on here ? did you come back here just to see her again ? 
but you 're planning to be ? 
you mean you 're still in contact with her ? 
who ? elizabeth ? 
but how do you know for sure you have to try to find a way to fig -- 
but i do n't understand -- 
why not ? 
i 'm asking for real . i want you to turn that camera off and make love with me . will you ? 
so why wo n't you make love with me ? why would n't you i mean ? 
but i feel like maybe i could be really comfortable with you . 
but if you were ? 
if you were in love with me would you ? 
you 're really never going to make love again ? 
yeah i know but somehow i expect that from her i mean she 'll do it with almost anybody i do n't know i should n't stick up for her i guess but him . he lied so ... deeply ! ! ooo i want to watch him die ! ! 
god i m so mad at him ! ! 
i 'm babbling . 
kind of . i mean john 's like this kind of ... craftsman . like he 's a carpenter and he makes really good tables . but that 's all he can make and i do n't need anymore tables . 
subtlety yes . no subtlety . plus i 've never really felt able to open up with anyone . i mean that other person i told you about i enjoyed making love with him a lot but i still was n't able to really let go . i always feel like i 'm being watched and i should n't embarrass myself . 
i do n't know . it all gets back to that cynthia thing . i do n't like her ... eagerness . there 's nothing left to imagine there 's no ... 
not yet . i 'm not sure i will . i just want out . 
i do n't know anymore . i thought i was but obviously i was wrong . 
do n't you get lonely ? 
and now you can ? 
how come ? 
so you lied to her ? 
what was the problem ? 
so what happened ? was it so bad that it turned you off ? 
who was the last person you had sex with ? 
so you have had sex . 
you said you were n't always impotent . 
ca n't or wo n't ? 
why not ? 
on tape ? 
if i asked you to would you ? not on tape i mean ? 
i remember . you could do that could n't you ? go down on me ? 
have you fantasized about me ? 
i fantasized about you . 
i know . deep down i know that . it just bothers me when i have feelings or impulses that she has . 
because that 's how cynthia thinks ! ! all she does is think about that stuff and i hate that i do n't want to be like her i do n't want to be like her ! ! 
yes . whenever ... all right look . whenever i see a man that i think is attractive i wonder what it would be like with him i mean i 'm just curious i do n't act on it but i hate that i think that ! ! i wish i could just forget about that stuff ! ! 
i guess not . 
yes i have . i will . 
i do n't see what difference it makes i mean i can think what i want .   i do n't know if i want to do this anymore i 'm afraid ... i do n't mind answering the questions so much but if somebody were to see this ... 
is he going to see this ? 
you do n't know what i 'm thinking . 
sometimes . afterward . 
when we 're making love ? 
ann bishop millaney . 
ann bishop millaney . 
what will you do when the money runs out ? 
how do you pay for all this ? i mean rent and tapes and this equipment . 
then do it . 
what do you have to do to get ready ? 
what would you know about a normal frame of mind ? 
what difference does it make why i do it ? 
do n't you want to make one ? 
why not ? 
why did n't you tell me ? 
how did you know ? 
you know ? 
i 'm not sure why i came here . i had kind of decided not to talk to you after ... you know . 
yes i do . 
this is just ... so ... 
i do n't ... why ... why do you do this ? 
to you ? 
and they just answer them ? 
you just ask them questions ? 
like what ? 
what about sex ? 
about sex ? 
what ... what are these interviews about ? 
why not ? 
can we look at one ? 
all of these are interviews ? 
you went out with her ? 
who 's donna ? 
what kind of personal project ? 
i can see that . what are they ? 
what are these ? 
somehow i imagined books . i thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time . 
i just wanted to see how the place looked furnished . 
are you in the middle of something ? 
so since i 've never had sex with you by your own advice i should n't accept your advice . 
now you said never take advice from someone that you do n't know intimately right ? 
excuse me for asking but how would you know ? 
of course not . 
well my therapist knows me intimately . 
so you do n't believe in therapy ? 
are n't you ? 
my therapist said that -- 
why do you say i 'm self - conscious ? 
well ... are you self - conscious about it ? 
does it bother you ? 
you are ? 
you 're what ? 
as long as it 's not ... gross you know ? like some scar or something . it has to be like mine like something about you . 
so what 's your personal thing ? are you really going to tell me something personal ? 
i do n't know he just said he wants to wait . i quit asking . 
yeah actually i do . but john does n't . at least not right now . 
kids ? what about them ? 
yes ! yes ! i think that 's very true . very . 
do you understand what i 'm trying to say ? 
okay . i think ... i think sex is overrated . i think people place way too much importance on it . and i think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap . i m not saying women do n't want it i just do n't think they want it for the reason men think they do .   i 'm getting confused . 
can i tell you something personal ? i feel like i can . it 's something i could n't tell john . or would n't anyway . 
right right . i do n't feel connected to many people either . other than john . 
i feel like they do . 
maybe you 'll understand this because you know john but he confuses me sometimes . 
okay i will ! ! 
would you mind ? 
what 's the first ? 
who 's elizabeth ? 
mother father sister . 
thank you . 
that 's hard to believe . the two of you seem so different . 
why 'd you drop out ? 
why ? did n't you know him well ? 
nine years ? 
how long has it been since you 've seen john ? 
oh uh - huh . 
oh definitely . i mean just this past year has gone by like phew ! i hardly even knew it passed . 
... free - lance . you know . 
well ... well the cliché about the security of it that 's really true . we own a house and i really like that you know ? and i like that john was just made junior partner so he has a steady job and he 's not some ... 
oh i like it . i like it very much . 
you play an instrument ? 
no not really . 
no i think you look ... fine . 
oh uh - huh . 
graham is an unusual name . 
no . why ? 
do you have other things ? 
we ... do n't usually let people smoke in the house . we have a patio if you -- 
oh . well please sit down . 
that was quick . 
i have thought about it yes . 
not very often . 
he does . 
i 'm not going to discuss this with you anymore . you 're making no sense . 
no but i wanted to . i really wanted to partially just to piss you off . 
i drove around . then i went to talk with graham . 
we 'll call it uncontested or whatever . i just want out . 
i want out of this marriage . 
i want out of this marriage . 
i know . 
i do n't know . sometimes i feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world . 
i did n't say it was rational i just said i was convinced . 
i 'm sorry too . i ... i get these ideas in my head you know and i have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios . and then i want to believe it so i do n't think i 've wasted the whole day . last week i was convinced you were having an affair with cynthia i do n't know why . 
you 've made your point . 
always the lawyer . 
why do n't i believe you ? 
but i 'm not . 
is that supposed to comfort me ? 
my sister for one . is that who it is ? 
i ca n't tell you how upset i would be if you were lying . 
if i 'm right i want to know . i do n't want you to lie . i 'd be very upset but not as upset as if i 'd found out you 'd been lying . 
well are you ? 
are you having an affair ? 
who 'd you have lunch with ? 
that 's interesting because i did n't leave a message . 
did you see a message to call me when you got back in ? 
i called you tuesday at 3:30 and they said you were n't in . do you remember where you were ? 
graham and i were talking about apartments and i told him to check the garden district there are some nice little places there garage apartments and stuff . 
oh we get along okay . she 's just very ... she 's an extrovert . i think she 's loud . she probably would n't agree . definitely would n't agree . 
you did that ? 
i know but this ... i just feel like everybody i know right now is obsessed with sex . 
because all she thinks about are these guys she 's after and i just hate her she 's such a little slut i thought that in high school and i think that now . why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what 's the big damn deal ? i mean it 's okay and everything but i do n't understand when people let it control them control their lives why do they do that ? 
i hate my sister . 
but you do n't have hidden motives for feeling that way right ? 
not really . 
i guess . 
what do you mean ? i do n't understand . 
that guy graham i told you about . he said taking advice from someone you do n't know intimately was ... well he said a lot of stuff . 
i 've been thinking about it for awhile and then i was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me . 
i guess but not because of the way he looked or anything . he 's just so different somebody new to have a conversation with . i 'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they 're going to buy the station wagon you know ? it 's just boring . i do n't know he was just different . and he 's really on about truth a lot being honest and i like that i felt comfortable around him .   after he left i had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room . 
what do you mean like physically ? 
no he left last week . 
oh graham . no i did n't talk to him about that . actually that turned out to be pretty interesting . i expected graham to be this ... well like john you know ? i mean he said they had gone to school together so i was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff . but he turned out to be this ... this kind of character i mean he 's kind of arty but okay you know ? 
what visitor ? 
well the cumulative effect is not good let me tell you .   i knew i should n't have watered those plants . 
yes it 's this radioactive gas in the ground and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up and -- you 've never heard of this ? 
well i do n't know . the week started off okay but then i was outside watering the plants and i started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the greenhouse effect so i went inside and turned on the air - conditioner full blast and that made me feel a little better until i started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor and -- 
well kind of recently i guess . but not too recently . 
well i kind of tried once . it just seemed stupid i kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid and kind of uh i do n't know and then i was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we do n't know what to do with all that garbage you know ? 
god no . 
what do you mean ? 
but see he stopped before i got that feeling that 's why it seems weird to me . i mean i 'm sure he wishes i would initiate things once in awhile and i would except it never occurs to me i 'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that i have felt like starting something i was by myself . 
oh yeah .   but see i 've never really been into sex that much i mean i like it and everything it just does't freak me out i would n't miss it you know ? but anyway lately we have n't been doing anything at all . like i said it 's not that i miss it but i 'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden . 
about a week ago . i do n't know what brought it on i just started feeling like i did n't want him to touch me . 
fine i guess . except right now i 'm going through this where i do n't want him to touch me . 
yeah i know . 
i guess i 'm upset because i ca n't really justify being upset i mean it 's his house really he pays the mortgage . 
no . i do n't know . i have n't told him about the garbage thing because i 'm pissed off at him right now . he 's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days and he did n't even ask me about it . i mean i would 've said yes i just wish he would 've asked . 
well do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are ? i mean maybe they do but i doubt those people are in therapy . besides being happy is n't all that great . my figure is always at its best when i 'm depressed . the last time i was really happy i put on twenty - five pounds . i thought john was going to have a stroke . 
yeah so ? 
what do you mean ? 
well this weekend john was taking out the garbage and he kept spilling things out of the container and i started imagining a container that grew garbage like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself and how could you stop that if it started happening ? 
do n't you think that 's a lot of garbage ? i 'd really like to know where it 's all going to go . 
nothing . i mean nothing . i try not to do anything that will produce garbage so obviously we 're talking about eating and basic stuff like that . did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day ? 
i get real busy between two and four . 
do you have my work number ? 
well . i ca n't stay . 
thirty - two dollars . 
i was just trying to -- 
it does not . 
it 's a sun dress . 
here it is . 
i do n't want to discuss it . 
you are in serious trouble . 
so he 's got this catalogue of women touching themselves ? that does n't make you feel weird ? 
that does n't mean you do . you ca n't possibly trust him he 's ... perverted . 
you know what i mean you do n't even know him ! 
i mean i could n't do that in front of john even . 
i ca n't believe you did that ! ! 
you are in trouble . 
you touched him ? 
did he touch you ? 
you do n't know that for sure . 
cynthia who knows where that tape may end up ? he could be ... bouncing it off some satellite or something . some horny old men in south america or something could be watching it . 
but why did you want to ? 
why did you do that ? 
did he ask you to take your clothes off ? 
oh so you 'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape but you wo n't tell your own sister ? 
well like what did he ask exactly ? 
what kinds of questions ? 
i do n't know . 
i do n't want to talk about it . 
no he 's not dangerous . not physically . 
no it 's nothing like that . 
because . cynthia look john was right . graham is strange . very strange . you do n't want to get involved with him . 
because i never got around to it . 
no i did n't . 
i do n't ... he does n't want you to come over . 
i was thinking maybe i should n't be in therapy anymore . 
i just thought it might -- 
do n't you think she deserves a little more than a card ? i mean the woman gave birth to you . it 's her fiftieth birthday -- 
a card ? for her fiftieth birthday ? 
are you getting mom something for her birthday ? 
lose something ? 
and ... do whatever it is you do . 
i do n't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and ... 
let me talk to him first . 
he 's not getting a phone he does n't like talking on the phone . 
but he wo n't . 
he does n't have a phone . 
i have a pretty good idea . 
oh for god 's sake . really cynthia really i do n't think he 's your type . 
well i wonder why . 
well he does n't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing anyway . 
you know what . you say it just to irritate me . 
do you have to say that ? 
why so you can go after him ? 
not really . maybe if i just saw him on the street i 'd have said that but after talking to him ... he 's just kind of ... i do n't know unusual . 
no not at all . actually i do n't think john likes him much anymore . he said he thought graham had gotten strange . 
i do n't know . he went to school here then he was in new york for awhile then philadelphia and then just kind of travelling around . 
so will you someday . 
it was busy . 
i wish you 'd get an answering machine . 
wait a minute . do you mean ... do n't tell me you ... in front of him . 
did you take your clothes off ? 
thank you . 
so what 's my share of the dress ? 
hold on . 
it looks like a tablecloth . 
what is it ? 
then why do you keep asking about it ? 
ann i do n't understand why this freaks you out so much . you did n't do it i did and if it does n't bother me why should it bother you ? 
no . i do n't think they all did what i did . 
he 's harmless . he just sits around and looks at these tapes . what 's the big deal ? 
i feel like i do . 
you could n't do it period . 
listen to you ! ! you sound like mom . what are you talking about ? 
in front of him ann yes . 
no but i did . 
well it 's too late now is n't it ? 
he would n't do that . 
i wanted him to see me . 
because i wanted to . 
what ! ? 
yes i did . 
well like i do n't want to tell you exactly . 
questions about sex . 
he just asked me questions . 
then why 'd you call me ? 
well what then ? 
well what ? is he dangerous ? 
what the hell happened over there ? did he make a pass at you ? 
well why ? 
why not ? 
what do you mean he does n't want me to come over ? did you tell him about me ? 
good . now if you 'll pardon me i have to go to work . 
okay ann okay . how about this : you buy her something nice and i 'll pay for half . all right ? 
will you stop ? jesus . 
what 's wrong with that ? 
i do n't know i 'll get her a card or something . 
that goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune . 
and what ? 
why ? just give me the address you wo n't even have to be involved . 
oh please . okay so give me the zen master 's address i 'll think of a reason to stop by . 
what are you talking about ? 
well i 'll call him when he does . 
ann you do n't have a clue . look i do n't even know why we 're discussing this i 'll just call him myself . 
i think you 're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together . i think you 're afraid he 'll be undeniably drawn to me . 
ann you always underestimate me . 
i say it because it 's descriptive . 
besides even if i decided to fuck his brains out what business is that of yours ? 
jesus ann get a life . i just asked what he looked like . 
i just want to know what he looks like is all . 
uh - huh . so what 's he look like ? 
is he ? strange i mean ? 
must be nice . so what 's he like is he like john ? 
goddamit give me my tape then . 
i ca n't believe you 're doing this after i let you tape me . 
well what the hell am i supposed to do ? 
how about if you record over the one we already made ? you could have the same date and not use another tape . who would know ? 
so make an exception . 
but i want you to do it i want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything somebody i can play to and feel safe because you ca n't do anything . 
now who the hell is going to do that for me ? 
i ca n't talk you into it ? 
no ? not even one more ? 
i 'd like to make another tape . 
look i 'm just going to come right out and tell you why i 'm here okay ? 
he does n't have to tell me . 
john does n't have sex with ann anymore . 
prettier than ann ? 
do you think i 'm pretty ? 
do you like the way i look ? 
would you like me to take my pants off ? 
then i started moving my hand and then he stopped talking . 
he said that my hand felt good . 
it was warmer than i thought it would be and the skin was softer than it looked . it 's weird . thinking about it now the organ itself seemed like a separate thing a separate entity to me . i mean after he pulled it out and i could look at it and touch it i completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it . i remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me . 
no . if anything after i looked at it awhile it got more interesting . it had character you know ? 
not really . i did n't picture it with veins or ridges or anything i thought it would be smooth like a test tube . 
very much live . 
when i was fourteen . 
no . he kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer and then his family moved away . to cleveland actually . 
my first sexual experience or the first time i had intercourse ? 
cynthia patrice bishop . 
i 'd rather sit . are you ready ? 
do i sit or stand ? 
can i see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what -- 
how long will it take ? 
and you ask questions right ? 
how do we start ? 
would anybody else see the tape ? 
is this how you get off or something ? taping women talking about their sexual experiences ? 
and that 's all ? 
you just want to ask me questions ? 
what makes you think i 'd discuss that with you ? 
about what ? 
doing what ? 
well either you are or you are n't . which is it ? 
well they must be something sexual because ann gets freaked out by that shit . are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something ? 
oh okay . i think i get it . 
i think you 're right . so come on i came all the way over here to find out what got ann so spooked tell me what happened . 
well i do n't really listen to her when it comes to men . i mean look at john for crissake . oh you went to school with him did n't you ? you 're probably friends or something . 
i uh know a guy at the power company . 
she still is . 
well like i said ann is my sister . sisters talk . you can imagine the rest . 
you want me to leave ? 
she must have been in a good mood when she said that . she usually calls me loud . 
i 'm ann millaney 's sister . 
i 'm cynthia bishop . 
no john things are getting real simple . 
john we have nothing to talk about . 
i know . will you please leave now ? 
if he had been under your prick you 'd have spotted him for sure . 
no he did n't put me up to this . jesus i do n't need people to tell me what i should do . i 've just been thinking about things that 's all . 
come on john . you should be happy we 've gone this far without ann finding out i 'm making it real easy on you . just walk out of here and i 'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime . 
how about straightening up the living room ? 
actually no i 've changed my mind . i should n't have called . 
oh please . come on john . you 're fucking your wife 's sister and you hardly been married a year . you 're a liar . but at least i know you 're a liar . it 's the people that do n't know like ann that have to watch out . 
exactly what i said . i 'd trust him before i 'd trust you . how much clearer can i be ? 
yeah i do . a helluva lot more than i trust you . 
it wo n't . i trust him . 
hung up . 
she 's a grown - up she can handle it . 
why not ? 
of course . she is my sister . i tell her almost everything . 
i felt like it so what ? goddam you and ann make such a big deal out of it . 
does n't work . he has to know the people he has to be able to interact with them . 
i like the way he dresses . 
well you know him he 's a friend of yours do you think he can be trusted ? 
what 's so stupid about it ? 
look i 'll call you okay ? 
i do n't think my sister would agree . 
i do n't know . i 'm not sure i can duplicate the level of intensity i had the other day . 
well this is timely . your wife is here would you like to speak to her ? 
then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here . 
right now . 
i want to see you . 
yeah i know what you mean . 
how about inviting me over to dinner ? 
not today . i 've got other plans . 
you are scum . i 'll be there . 
sure . maybe he 's the man i 'm looking for . then i wo n't have to fuck worried husbands all the time . 
i 'm intrigued . 
you should be . can i meet this friend of yours ? 
afraid of getting caught ? 
well maybe i could just start a rumor then . 
i wish i could tell everybody that ann 's a lousy lay . beautiful popular ann bishop millaney . 
i did . 
i can handle it . besides the money is good and some of the guys are cute . and you are in no position to be jealous . 
meaning we 'll have to cool it for awhile right ? 
do n't give me this passive / aggressive bullshit . if you want to leave leave . my life does n't stop when you walk out the door you know what i 'm saying ? 
i only get one today ? gee how exciting . 
some people do it on the pavement 
really .   what 'll i pin this on ? 
he was a president . 
did you /hear/ that oliver . 
look .   look at that .   bert schnick can see .   why ... he's ... dancing . 
oh i adore coleridge taylor .   as a matter of fact ... 
it pays to know your way around oliver . 
are you spoken for this evening ? 
overreact !   you 're the one with theories about conspirac ...   oliver ? 
i bet that macy struthers had a hand in this .   we 'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips ! 
conspiracy is right .   the denton dossier is ... 
sounds like my husband .   he never came back either .   at least not after flavors gave him a commercial break . 
conspiracy ?   that sounds a little farfetched . 
bert brought them over from europe .   they had a very popular series together .   it 's still rerun in a lot of countries .   you must have seen them in ' dentonvale ? ' 
macy struthers -- god i must have been blind -- still the weaker the man the dumber the blonde . 
everything 's free there . 
why oliver since ralph and i separated maturity is something i look for in a man . 
oh oliver you 're so tolerant . time for a coffee before you rush off ? 
thank you so much judge wright for another wonderful interview . 
i detect a note of reticence . are you perhaps one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative ? 
oh oliver .   what are we going to do ? 
shove it ralph ! 
not at all .   you have your life .   and i have mine . 
well in that case ... 
no we 're paying for the wine . 
you are not . 
that 's hilarious . you sound just like one of those guys . 
anything i 'd know ? 
oh yeah ? what kind of stuff ? 
are you a writer too ? 
highliner please . 
hi . well nice to see you guys here . bye miles . 
hi . it 's maya . please leave a message . 
you know i just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception . and i 've been doing just fine . 
but you wanted to fuck me first . 
oh just that he loves her . that she 's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world . how he adores siena . how he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to . 
do you know what he 's been saying to her ? 
do n't touch me . just take me home . 
were you ever going to say anything ? 
what rehearsal dinner ? 
did you hear about this bordeaux tasting dinner down in santa barbara saturday night ? it 's a little pricey but if you wanted to go i 'd be into it . why do n't you stay through the weekend ? 
about two - thirty . 
you guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today . 
you too . 
i had class . 
hey miles i heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me . 
goodnight miles . 
oh yeah . sure . of course . 
okay . see you around . 
i had a good time tonight miles . i really did . 
you know how to get back to the windmill right ? 
like what a fraud he was . 
i suppose i got really into wine originally through my ex - husband . he had a big kind of show - off cellar . but then i found out that i have a really sharp palate and the more i drank the more i liked what it made me think about . 
what about me ? 
why are you so into pinot ? it 's like a thing with you . 
can i ask you a personal question ? 
oh yeah . who cares ? i 'm the queen of typos .   wow this is really starting to open up . what do you think ? 
i commute to san luis obispo twice a week . 
yeah . i 'm working on a masters in horticulture . chipping away at it . 
like me i have this stupid paper due on friday and as usual i 'm freaked out about it . just like in high school . it never changes . 
wow . anyway i think it 's amazing you 're getting it published . really . i know how hard it is . just to write it even . 
so is it kind of about death and mortality or ... ? 
oh . you mean ... today ? 
what 's the title ? 
so what 's your novel about ? 
yeah weird . but great . 
it 's kind of weird sitting here with you in stephanie 's house . all those times you came into the restaurant . it 's like you 're a real person now . almost . 
yeah same here . 
you got kids ? 
she 's with her grandmother . she 's with steph 's mom . she spends a lot of time over there . steph 's ... well she 's stephanie . 
yeah siena 's a sweetie . 
i think they overdid it a bit . too much alcohol . overwhelms the fruit . 
eighty - eight sassicaia . 
i started to get serious about seven years ago . 
the day you open a ' 61 cheval blanc that 's the special occasion . 
it might be too late already . what are you waiting for ? 
seriously the ' 61s are peaking are n't they ? at least that 's what i 've read . 
you 've got a ' 61 cheval blanc that 's just sitting there ? go get it .   right now . hurry up ... 
so what gems do you have in your collection ? 
oh yeah . steph 's way into pinots and syrahs .   hey steph ? you sure we can open anything ? anything we want ? 
are you all right ? 
i 'm having the salmon . 
i know . i love that . 
i know the winemaker . she comes in the restaurant all the time . 
twelve months in oak . 
try it . 
a fiddlehead sauvignon blanc . 
well good to see you miles . jack . 
yeah i know what you mean . it 's a long drive up here . where 're you staying ? 
good for you . 
so how 's that book of yours going miles ? i think you were almost done with it last time we talked . 
oh yeah sunday night . you guys been out tasting today ? 
i 'm doing good good . you look great . did you lose some weight ? 
hey miles . good to see you . 
see you over there miles . 
i 'm pregnant . 
not me . i 'm not drinking . 
i guess . 
i am . 
oh miles . that 's awful . what are you going to do ? 
so what 's happening with your book ? 
so how 're you doing ? 
yeah he 's good that way . very considerate . 
thanks . um this is ken cortland my husband . 
miles maybe it is better if you do n't come to the wedding . 
i 'm going to hang up now miles . 
miles i do n't care if you come to the wedding or not . 
miles do n't call me when you 're drunk . 
where are you ? 
oh miles . you 're drunk . 
fine . what 's uh what 's on your mind ? 
the truck ... the truck has severed most of her lower half . 
see father ray 's truck swerved off the road and ah ... hit colleen and then a tree . she was pinned between the two . 
she 's not in an ambulance father . 
yes ... that 's the first thing colleen asked too . 
he was n't drinking . ray fell asleep at the wheel . 
you take care of yourself ...   graham . 
it 's left its mark still . the last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world . take them into town . get their minds -- your mind on everyday things . it 's good medicine . 
but i 'll tell you something what i said in their still goes . you and your family have been through a lot in the last two days ... not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago . 
is anything missing ? 
do you owe anybody money ? you can tell me off the record if you need too . 
let me ask you two something . do n't be embarrassed by the answer . it is possible ... just possible now you might have been chasing each other around ? you said you went in opposite directions . 
okay .   so he was tall ? 
i do n't know whether to look for a midget or a -- 
you ca n't describe him at all ? do n't you think that 's find of odd ? 
no father they 're edgy . on alert . like they act when they smell a predator around ... peeing on themselves and everything . 
some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior . sometimes violent behavior . theo henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow . 
second thing this week i ca n't explain . 
what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it ? 
there are none . 
the footprints . 
what 's that ? 
it 's the strangest thing father . 
i 've got a place i can hide her . 
he ca n't hurt me if he 's dead . 
how about you ? 
i 'm ready for that . 
some people think because they 're stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around . i 've seen a lot of that . but it 's only true if you let it be . the world is what you make of it . 
nah !   what 's he got ? this is a nice saloon but there are other nice saloons . it 's not the money . not for you . why ca n't i get ahold of it ?   cobb says there 's no telling what you 're going to care about . 
if he did n't you 'd never sit still while this was happening . 
cobb 's got something on you and it must be pretty good . 
what is it that i ca n't figure ? 
where 's the dog now ? 
you really are a gambler . 
that 's the good stuff . 
i 'm saving lives here . the straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather . 
here he comes right now . 
i do n't own this place . the man who does stuck me with kelly . 
yeah aside from being a loud - mouthed lying cheat he 's just the man i would have picked . 
that 's kelly my so - called partner . he runs that side . 
you see that fellow over there in the gray coat ? 
me too . what 's wrong with us ? 
you like a good saloon ? 
thanks . that 's what i call it too . 
i am . i 'm always there but i only shine at night . 
the world is what you make of it friend . if it does n't fit you make alterations . 
i run the place . what can i get you ? 
from what i 've seen paden does n't care much about money . 
i would n't worry about that . 
that was my plan . 
i 'm glad we talked . 
okay -- for you . 
simone i recognize the shirt you 're wearing .   i gave it to viktor on his birthday . 
we have a daughter together .   i just do n't want to see viktor get hurt . 
exactly .   you 're a household name now .   you 're moving in entirely different worlds .   that 's why i hope you 're not toying with viktor . 
my god are you alright simone ? 
you do n't have to protect my feelings simone .   i do n't blame viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world . 
i think he owes more to you .   but that 's not important now .   i know what 's going on between you two . 
no i understand .   that 's what i want to talk about .   i do n't know if you know this simone but viktor and i were married once . 
do n't look so glum viktor .   it 's not a death sentence . 
exactly .   now that you have the studio behind you we can really do things . 
do n't thank us too fast viktor . you know what we have to do ? 
how can you bring that up at a time like this ? 
you 're drunker than i thought .   are you doing that again ? 
how much wine have you had ? 
-- you just got lucky that she 's loyal enough to stay with you . maybe she 's staying out of pity who knows ?   she certainly does n't need you .   some people even say you 're holding her back . 
every actor is an invention viktor .   do n't embarrass yourself . no one 's denying that you discovered simone .   but it 's like finding a diamond in the desert . anyone can trip over it but it 's not the finder who sparkles . 
of course she will .   her public will demand it . 
but you do n't understand .   she 'll always be there -- at some party on some magazine cover some song on the radio up on some screen . 
oh viktor .   you say that now -- because we 're here alone like this .   but in the morning you 'd go back to her .   what man would n't ? 
that 's sweet viktor but i could n't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice .   it 's strange .   i 've stabbed people in the back clawed and slept my way to where i am -- it goes with the territory -- but for some reason i ca n't betray simone . there 's ... i do n't know any other way to say it -- there 's a goodness to her . 
this is crazy .   who am i fooling ? i ca n't compete with simone .   what woman can ? 
i want you back too viktor . 
-- and she was positively glowing at the awards .   i should be going she 'll be here soon -- 
i just read somewhere -- 
i 'm sure you 'll keep her focussed . she 's lucky to have you viktor .   is she really having your baby ? 
is simone back to earth yet ? 
i suppose i could stay just until she arrives . 
when is she coming over ? 
is it wednesday ?   it 's wednesday . how embarrassing .   i do n't know what i was thinking .   with all the excitement lately ...   am i interrupting something ?   are you expecting company ? 
i can imagine . 
... simone . 
lainey and i just wanted to congratulate ... 
it 's a crowded summer .   we need every photo - opp sound - byte and column inch we can get .   good night viktor . 
yes you do ...   anyway tonight was a good start . 
whenever i compliment simone you take the credit . 
viktor do you realize you always do that ? 
well yes .   from a studio point of view it would be better if simone stayed single .   anyhow i thought she came across great tonight .   intelligent well informed a natural .   and touching . she was spectacular . 
are you and simone ...   ... getting married ? 
-- viktor are you with her ?   is she there ? 
i 'd love to .   but are n't you supposed to meet up with simone ? 
she was there .   she did n't by any chance happen to mention me ? 
oh make it live -- please viktor . 
you 're so good to protect her like this . 
viktor you should have said something . 
-- i do n't think that 's necessary . i think it 's perfectly clear .   i should have guessed -- it all makes sense now ... it 's why she never goes anywhere never seen in public ... 
so the secret 's finally out viktor . 
-- it 's starting to look like she does n't support the film or you viktor .   if you ca n't handle her i will . 
-- we have to talk to her viktor ! 
that 's true . 
everyone i know has met her viktor . 
i 'd love to tell her myself .   when are you going to let me meet her ? 
yes .   to be honest i never quite saw this film before -- maybe it 's the way simone is playing it -- but what it 's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life how that 's the only way we can love -- i think it 's really going to mean something . 
i should fire you more often .   the film 's looking wonderful . 
maybe you 're right .   twelve years after your daughter 's born you decide to become a father . 
that 's genius viktor .   was that simone 's idea ? 
stunning viktor .   the hollywood foreign press is going to eat this up . 
viktor i have a feeling .   one of my feelings .   there 's something about her i do n't trust . 
experience viktor .   i 've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them .   i 'm worried about you that 's all .   this woman -- she controls your destiny . 
listen viktor ... i want to talk to you now not as elaine studio head but elaine ex - wife .   second ex - wife .   you got lucky this last time but you need to be careful .   we both know you would n't be making this overblown art film of you had n't convinced simone to be in it . 
i 'll walk you out . 
which accounts for your percentage .   when do i get to meet this dream ? 
well shoot it on the last day . 
even the fall from the plane ? 
there is n't one . 
al least a contingency for wardrobe .   any woman can go up a dress size . 
she was in the theater ?   when ? where ? 
hair and make - up ? 
well something has to be done about this budget .   it 's completely unrealistic .   you allowed nothing for limousine service . 
really ?   oh so she 's really going to do all this nudity ? 
whatever .   i still have n't received simone 's script notes . 
no problem .   do you want to come in ? 
viktor it 's my studio . 
do n't be ridiculous .   i arranged a press conference . 
why not ? 
i ca n't wait to meet her . 
viktor ... i want to thank you for convincing simone to sign with the studio . 
why is n't she with you ? 
where is she ? 
even if you find her you know the problem with unknowns viktor .   if they 're good they get known .   and then you 're back to sorting their candy ... and worse .   i 'm sorry viktor . 
they 're yours .   but how are you going to finish it ?   without a star there 's no movie . 
the picture 's dead . 
i 'm not taking away your daughter just your deal .   you and i both know after the divorce i kept you on for old time 's sake so you could still hold your head up in front of lainey .   i called what 's his name at warner 's .   he said he 'd take a meeting -- in july .   i 've fought for you viktor ...   you want to talk severance ? 
how can i ?   your last three pictures tanked .   the board is giving me hell .   no bankable star will work with you after this .   if you just compromised ... a little . 
-- christ viktor look around . what do you think pays for all this ?   this is about investment and return .   those days in new york ... that 's ... it 's over . 
listen viktor i have good memories of those days too -- but this is n't about that or you or me or some high - minded ideal .   this is business . 
-- it 's called a projector . 
you realize you 're nostalgic for an era you were n't even born in ? 
it 's the truth .   those 17 superstars are our insurance policy .   we ca n't open -- ca n't make a profit without them . 
the public decides who 's on that list . 
-- what 's wrong with that ? 
-- i have a feeling you 're going to tell me . 
-- viktor that was short subject . 
hmm ... mike and ike 's . 
god viktor .   why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself ? 
excuse us . 
of course she is .   no other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her . 
where are you ? 
yes -- oh my god .   is that you simone ? !   i 've been wanting to talk to you . 
lainey there 's no evidence that simone is n't real . 
well i -- 
of course .   what are you suggesting ? 
i know it as surely as you 're sitting here sweetheart .   she was the most vital woman i ever met . 
god it 's so like your father .   why ca n't people take responsibility for their actions anymore ?   i can almost forgive him for killing simone -- but denying her existence .   i can never forgive that . 
let 's go lainey .   there 's nothing here . 
thank simone for the tickets . 
sometimes .   but just when i think your father 's changing for the better i realize he 's as self absorbed as ever .   he took the credit for simone tonight . 
i have to talk to her . 
obviously this ca n't last .   she 's going to dump him .   viktor wo n't be able to take that .   he 's too sensitive .   it 'll destroy him . 
i ca n't believe she 's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way . it 's cruel . 
he also happens to be the most talented man i 've ever known . 
cole please stop . 
cole that 's very wrong . grandma 's gone . you know that . 
i would never think that about you ... ever ... got it ? 
... i do n't know . 
they talk to you ? 
you see ghosts cole ? 
dead people ? 
cole you 're scaring me . 
where is she ? 
you can see her ? 
oh my god . 
they did ? 
i 'd give anything to have been there . 
there 's only two of us .   maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet and then laid it nicely in your drawer ?   is that what happened ? 
so who moved it ? 
you did n't take it before . you did n't take it the time after that . and now you did n't take it again ? 
did you move the bumble bee pendant ? 
that 's right . so why do you take it sweetheart ? 
it was grandma 's . it 's not for playing .   what if it broke ? you know how sad i 'd be . 
lots of things . 
they 're right here . 
i wish i could be like my momma though . she always knew what was wrong . knew just what to say . 
i work at an insurance place and at penny 's so cole can go to that good school . 
cheese . it 's a kid 's place . 
the last time was a chuck e. cheese party a year ago . he hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and did n't come out . 
... he does n't get invited places . 
the hell with this .   i 'm coming back up ! ! ! 
not lately . 
the band . 
yeah . to get the hell off this farm . 
... you any good with those ? 
which street corner ? 
someone actually ... employs you ? 
hey ! do n't use all the hot water ! 
fuck me ? fuck you ! ! 
where 'd you come from ? groupies r us ? 
he should turn that music down . jeremiah 's gon na kill him . 
carl what are you doing ?

no shit . 
dammit carl ! ! ! !

how would you know ? you 're looking at my tits .   jesus carl . your job is to keep us on the road ! 
looks like the alternator . 
he 's right . you were behind . 
you seen mac ? his bed has n't been slept in . 
it 's a farm keith . you 're not supposed to shoot the rooster . 
you got something against farm people keith ? 
down boy . 
you know what they say about men who need big guns ... 
hey . could you be a little more insensitive ? we 're on our way to a funeral for crissake . 
the audience ! 
jesus . what a bunch of useless zombies . 
i almost thought for a second ... 
... no ... mac ... p - please ... 
you 've been ... hiding him all these years . helping him ... irrigate the land . with blood ... 
no . not without you -- 
mac ... let 's get out of here . 
no mac please ... i -- 
you sabotaged the bus ! you kept us here ... to die ! first keith then carl -- 
you brought us here . and that morning i found you in the barn . you had scratches on your face -- 
it 's you . you and your father . 
you 're ... limping . 
he 's still out there ! ! ! 
i ... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he 's he 's -- still -- out there -- 
billy bob 's dead . -- we were wrong -- he did n't do anything . i - it 's the scarecrow -- 
you never had trouble communicating before . 
mmmm -- so can i ... 
i do n't think so . keith 's about to use the rooster for target practice . besides ... you did n't seem too interested last night . 
getting ready . 
how 'd you get that ? playing with your pitchfork ? 
we 're almost ready . what the hell are you doing out here ? 
i bet if he were still alive he 'd like to watch . 
i 'm talking to the spirit of jethro macdonald . is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson ? we 'll be careful of the bed -- 
what 's wrong ? 
what about jeremiah ? 
then why go back now ? 
about what ? 
you never told us you grew up on a farm . 
what 'll we do ? 
why bother ? 
last night ... he tried to get it on with me . 
who knows ? just like a man ... never around when you need them . 
-- where have you two been ? 
second verse ! 
like your guitar break . 
hold it hold it . are n't you forgetting something rod ? 
what a surprise . -- what about our audition ? 
yeah i 'll teach you a lesson -- 
yeah . great work rod . but next time it would be nice ... if you could join us for the entire set ! 
and this is mine . 
you took bill . 
we can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here . 
he wants me bill ! i 'm going to get him to take me to him ! see if you can follow me and kill him ! 
we ca n't make it . just get away when you get the chance . 
after all this shit tonight i know for sure now you regret not running off with me to hollywood ! 
that was n't a good night no . 
my father he was -- he was real close to evil . people did n't know . still do n't . from the time i was a toddler he 'd beat the hell out of me . i do n't mean just like a smack for smart -- mouthing ... he took a real enjoyment in it . and when i turned eleven or twelve things ... well they got worse . starla looks at bill who seems struck . 
grant used to get filled up every day . i knew it was just to see me . he was too old -- but he was handsome . and he had that big ol' lincoln then . i flirted with him . 
i know what people say bill . i ... remember back in high school i worked at my father 's gas station ? 
bill i 'll run out to your car call for paramedics from there . 
it is . he 'd been acting strange . and the physical changes . i should have told someone right away ... but i was just blind . i wanted to pretend it was n't happening ... if i do n't do what i can to help now i just could n't live with it . 
please bill . what happened it 's my fault i know it . 
he did . i know . but i got him angry 'cause i was n't calm . this time i could -- 
wait ! dammit bill if that girl 's still out there how will you find her ? how unless you bring grant in alive ? your best chance of doing that is with me . i can talk to him -- 
bill i heard what you 're doing . i think i should go along . 
how about brenda ? 
no . what  ? 
grant where 'd you go ? 
i 'll get wally to show me sometime then . 
oh yeah ? 
i do n't know . i 've seen them so many times before . i guess any spot gets boring after awhile . 
just checking out the lights . 
whatcha ' doin' ? 
that 's not funny . 
grant you 're sick ! 
grant no ! 
i 'll get if for you . 
grant . oh my god . what happened to your -- ? 
it 's just one of my students grant .

grant ? why are there -- did you put locks on the garage ? 
i never danced in a towel before . 
that 's not true -- where are you-- ? 
where are you going ? 
that 's disrespectful . 
i 'm sorry . i do n't just have some switch . 
grant no -- i 'm sorry i 'm just -- i 'm not in the mood . grant is on top of her breathing a little too heavy . grant come on baby it 's -- 
it 's just a work thing . 
he 's teaching environmental science grant . probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester . 
an animal that does n't procreate . it spreads grows . a living disease . 
and you said the worms are part of him . they 're all linked like one creature ? 
through a wound on his stomach ? 
what other stuff ? 
brought you munchies . 
stuff you can never imagine . feelings . big thoughts . and love . yeah . i 'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more . so go ahead there beautiful and take off your shirt . 
guess it 's hard to explain how amazin ' a human brain is to someone who that 's all they know . 
where 's the old half -- mexican ? 
you 're lookin ' awful pretty . 
already ai n't . married a gal named -- 
who 's the lucky fella ?

oh yeah that 's what he wants to borrow this guy . 
see ya bandit . 
what are you thinking ? 
listen he 's nuts . i mean certifiable . but believe it or not he once looked great in levis . that 's why my mother married him . but like all good things ...   i know what you 're thinking . 
i should 've told you but you would 've thrown me out right ? 
he 's just exhausted . 
promise me you wo n't fall in love with an inmate . 
well thanks for the lift . 
one to five ? 
why are you stopping ? 
what are you gon na do when you get home ? 
what kind of a guy is he ? 
-- it 's hard to believe this schmuck kyle would go to such lengths for coors beer . 
they should arrest people for obeying the speed limit . 
my very words . 
he was n't . one day i came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl . and her sister . 
-- actually my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named ramblin ' bobby holt . when i turned twenty- one i went to europe with visions of being free and independent . my luck he was on the plane . i landed in paris and fell in love before i could claim my baggage .   we were together for almost a year . i thought he was it . 
forget it . this is one of the longest relationships i 've ever had . i 'm not blowing it now . 
you take the front i 'll take the back . 
how do you know ? 
then let 's change the subject .   what do you think about forced school busing ? 
you plan on driving trucks all your life ? 
do i know ? i 'm an authority on it . 
you plan on driving trucks all your life ? 
nice meeting you cledus . keep on truckin ' . 
uh - oh . 
-- you know i used to be a high fashion model . tried it for six months and almost freaked . makeup silly clothes a little man saying ' darling ' every two seconds ... 
you want to lose this putz or not ? ! ? 
like what ? 
you might have said no . i have trouble handling rejection . 
look the truth is i did n't want to be dumped at the truck stop . i wanted to go on with you . i needed an excuse . 
i would 've come back for you . 
i 've never seen him before in my life . i 'm just trying to help you out . 
he 's after us again ! 
jesus ! ! ! 
enjoy your kenworth . 
enough to get to jersey . i 'll walk the rest of the way . i 've been sitting a long time .   nice meeting you . it 's been a trip . 
i do n't know . we were planning on seeing the astrodome . 
we lost him . 
you know my mother was a dancer too . her big shot was the touring company of ' brigadoon . ' she 's been married three times . to a redneck a poet and her tennis instructor .   see i motor - mouth when i get nervous . i was nervous when i first got into the car . now i 'm scared shitless . 
i do n't know . maybe jerry jeff sent the heat after us . 
you know you 're not a bad driver . 
what do you want to be when you grow up ? 
can i ask you something ? 
we 're cool . the dumb schmuck took the wrong turn . 
what the hell 's going on ? 
you just passed your nemesis . 
guess what ? 
seriously ? ! ? 
where you from ? 
you have a great profile . 
driving talking to me ... 
is this fun ? 
no . i want to know what you think about besides ditching smokey ? 
well ? ... 
so tell me about yourself . 
eyes on the road . 
an existentialist . 
but you could get killed right ? 
a truck ? you 're doing this for a truck ? that 's insanity . 
why are you doing this obviously macho feat ? 
who 'd want to ? 
why ? you have a bowling date ? 
why 're you driving so fast ? 
kate mcconnell . 
look i 'm a twenty - eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags . besides i 'm impulsive . it runs in the family . we 're all crazy . mind if i smoke ?   anyway today was the ' bid day . ' but as i was walking down the aisle i realized this is total insanity . what am i going to do in texas the rest of my life ? i ca n't marry jerry jeff . i mean we 're eventually gon na have to talk . so halfway down the aisle i turned and split . you think i 'm nuts right ? 
okay . i was in texas dancing in an industrial show for sunkist oranges . they say i 'm the new anita bryant . but i 'm really a dancer from new york . a lot of credits . moderate talent .   anyway after opening night i was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was . a tall texan with a twenty - nine inch waist . pure dynamite .

what are we talkin ' on the split ... 
shhhh .   just stay with me .   stay with me .   everything is forgiven . everything . 
you must have been dreaming . 
i do n't know .   something .   anything . 
what are you taking ? 
am i really her ? 
i ca n't -- 
i have consciousness but i am not mortal .   do n't you see why i 'm going crazy ? 
they do something to me .   it 's hard to think straight . 
i want to stop taking those pills . 
but then i would be dead now . 
did you hear what gibarian said ? i 'm not a human being .   i 'm an instrument .   i came from your memory and your imagination and i will torture you no matter what .   even if i remain passive .   that 's when i drank the ...   i was going mad .   it felt like there was no body underneath my skin . there was something else .   an illusion .   but i could feel my heart beating and i remembered you tested my blood .   is it like yours ? 
i ... i am rheya .   but i am not the woman you loved ten years ago . 
that 's impossible .   i 'm not rheya . 
you 're lying . 
what do i have to do to stop it ? 
chris please .   chris i 'm serious . i wo n't make it . 
you never said you wanted one . 
chris i had to .   i had to .   i did n't think you 'd react like this . 
it would n't have made any difference . 
do n't do this .   i am literally begging you not to do this .   chris . 
then you 'll die . 
you 're lying .   i 'm not human . 
i 'm disgusting . 
do n't call me that . 
i 'm not rheya .   you 've always known that . 
how could it be so cruel ?   how could it torture us like this ? 
do n't .   i 'm the one at risk here . if we 're playing out what happened before i wo n't survive . 
please do n't lie .   i told you before i do n't know how i came to be here . whatever you think you ca n't say to me i need to hear you say it . 
what 's happening to us ? 
you said he was dead . 
what 's wrong ? 
if you 're here . 
do you want to stay here ? 
but that 's what happened before . 
i have these strange thoughts i do n't know where they come from .   i ca n't explain it . 
that 's what you were saying .   i heard what you were saying . 
you do n't want me . 
i 'm just as human as you .   i see i hear i touch and i feel just like you do . 
you 're the coward . 
i do n't think do .   it 's not sleep ; it 's something else .   it 's all around me . 
i love you too . 
was she right ? 
why did she do it ? 
but we fought . 
i 'm just trying to understand what 's going on . 
that i am not rheya .   that rheya died .   killed herself .   i 'm different . 
you do n't love me . 
i 'm glad . 
do i really feel like ... i am ... ? 
it was obvious from the way he first looked at me . 
you feel sorry for solaris or for me ? 
he has a point . 
sartorius wants to destroy it . 
what does snow think you should do ? 
you know i 've decided : i 'm just gon na believe what you believe about this whole solaris thing it 'll make life so much easier ; the little wife agreeing with her big strong husband . you must get such a headache thinking about those great big problems all day . 
i like that too . 
good .   because i want you to know . i really like fucking you . 
do you have any idea how much i like fucking you ? 
i ca n't help feeling that i 'm cheating when i take them . 
why did you say those things ? 
what happened to us exactly ? 
thinking what you were doing and saying just being consumed by thinking of you .   i loved it so much that feeling . 
scared .   no not scared .   wary . like i was something to be ... her guard went up .   i was a threat .   now i know why .   she was afraid she 'd be seen .   that i would see her for the self - obsessed neurotic that she was . i think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal . but that 's the cycle right ?   i knew a little more than she did she knew a little more than her mother and on and on .   i guess that 's part of the reason why -- 
seven eight .   so one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space and she asks me what i 'm doing and i start trying to explain to her about this state that i can put myself in and this look comes over her face . 
i would have these -- i do n't know how to describe them -- visions when i was younger .   maybe not visions but like these waking dream states .   time would just collapse i would be inside time .   i would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped .   freaky stuff . 
i been thinking about how much i hate you . 
when i saw you were gone i got scared . 
what happened ? 
as i said then it 's god right ? 
but what if solaris is what there was before the big bang ? 
even a god that was n't active that just created something and stood back and watched ? 
you still do n't believe in god ? 
then it 's god right ? 
is it intelligent ? 
is it a planet ? 
yes .   but not until you mentioned them .   as soon as you said those things i remembered them .   and they have associations that make me think of other things i remember .   it 's like filling up . 
what do you mean ? 
i know i know .   but still somehow i do n't feel better . 
you talk like an actor . 
you go home . 
and i just want to know if i 'm crazy or not -- if what i think is happening is actually happening .   or am i one of those people those women who are blind to what 's going on ?   who pretend not to see their husband 's attention toward another woman ? 
you behave as though you want to fuck her . 
you want to fuck her ? 
i was n't . 
not a very happy poem . 
my thomas is a little rusty . 
i want you inside me right now . 
we 're taking a flight ? 
to calm my anxiety . 
what are they ? 
i do n't know .   i ca n't be alone . 
do n't . 
i 'll go with you . 
it 's terrific win . 
you did n't like him ? 
they 've got two monsters now .   both boys . 
hello win . 
say goodbye mike . 
you have a weakness for lady cops . 
i 'll miss you mike . 
i think it 's probably still a good idea . 
i do n't know ... 
everyone 's all right ... ? 
mike ... ? 
... mike . 
i 'll have to pack a lot of clothes . 
long enough . 
... do n't explain . 
i know . 
i know . 
let 's do it . 
do you ? 
what a memory . 
no really it 's okay i 've got ta go . i 'm expecting some calls .   i 'll be fine really . 
listen you 're right .   do n't do it . i 'll just ... send you an address okay ? 
tomorrow night .   can you come ? 
i do n't know .   garber 's left orders here not to let you in the building . 
pretty far .   i 'm told not to say anything about it on the phone in case it 's tapped ... they think it 's best safer if i go away at least till venza 's found . 
i 'm going away after that the next morning . 
i 'm taking them all out to queens as a matter of fact right in your neighborhood .   there 's an event at my father 's school ... an anniversary ... i thought maybe you could come ... 
oh god that 's great ! 
oh i do want to know .   i tried to reach you at the precinct . 
what do you want to do ? 
you told her ? 
okay then let 's make it easy .   it was a mistake .   do n't make me feel guilty now that it 's over let 's forget about it . 
this is me mike .   there 's nothing else ... 
they called here after you left ... 
more bullshit !   more bullshit !   what kind of odds are they giving me ?   there must be some kind of office pool .   one month ?   a couple of days ? 
i trusted you !   i thought you cared about me ? ! 
let go ! 
i 'm perfectly calm i 'm a normal human being .   i 'm going for a walk in the park . 
you told me i 'm safe ?   i 'm going for a walk in the park . 
and then what ?   i 'll never be safe . i 'll have to leave the country !   you ca n't protect me and you ca n't keep him in jail !   and you knew that all the goddamn time ! 
you put me life in danger . 
i ca n't open it . 
what do you want ? 
good night mike . 
i 'll miss you mike ... 
he 's very caring in his way .   you have n't seen him at his best . 
tell it like it is . 
you do n't like him do you ? 
i saw you with a dog in my mind . 
that 's nice .   and you live in queens ?   with a child and a dog ... ? 
okay .   let 's just see if a mugger gets me . 
and die laughing because you 're walking so stupid ! 
that 's the dumbest walk i ever saw ! 
you mean to tell me a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way ? 
want to go out for a drink ?   i mean we 're both sitting here and joey venza 's in jail ... 
so this could be your last night huh ? 
you know why they 're like that ... ? he was myopic ... going blind . 
you put it back in the wrong place ... do you like renoir ? 
you were reading my renoir . 
did n't do very well did you ? 
urdu and hindi . 
right .   how could he do that if he 's in jail and they 've thrown away the key ... ? 
he said he 'd kill me . 
i guess i 'm supposed to do it in the morning .   identify him . 
if i had known i was going to have company he was right next to me .   i think he heard me peeing !   i hate that i am glad he 's in jail . 
listen that was my fault . 
hi .   just checking to see if you 're here . 
i think i can probably do that on my own . 
i 'll have a spritzer order something soft for yourself ... i must go for a pee . 
let 's get a drink . 
people think i 'm stepping out on neil .   we 're causing quite a scandal . 
you can touch me i wo n't bite . 
put it on my account please . 
since you 're going to be my escort you 'll need a new tie . 
would you pick one out please ? 
are you nervous ? 
i 'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary . 
my father founded a music school there .   the milton gregory school . 
you live in manhattan ? 
what did he say ? 
do you have another tie ?   something more conservative ? 
there 's a phone in the car . 
can we go then ? 
lieutenant garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger is that true ? 
i have to pick something up before bergdorf 's closes then stop at a reception just a few blocks away . 
i 'm sorry .   i 'm not sure how this works .   i have to go out ... is that all right ? 
straight ahead . 
i 've never seen anyone killed before . 
just putting in an appearance then . 
not if you do n't want me to . 
it was something my father always liked me to do . 
and i 'm making mine . 
... he killed win ... he enjoyed it ... 
... you know and i know that the only thing standing between a life sentence for venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial ... 
... i do n't want to talk about it ... 
tommy ... ! 
i do n't know tommy . 
sure we are let 's go ! 
he does n't want to sleep here .   neither do i.   it 's not my house anymore . 
i 'm all right . 
was it venza ?   did you get him ? 
he 'll live through it .   they all live through it .   what a world huh ? 
i 'm going to visit my sister for a few days .   i 'd like you to get your stuff out . 
get away from me ... get away !   she means that much to you you stay with her .   but you come back you come back for me .   not for tommy not for your mother or your fucking job but for me . 
what 's the difference ? 
i already did .   i mean i talked to his wife and she talked to him ... 
i 'd like you to switch to the day shift mike .   to be home for dinner . helen insists that t.j. be home for dinner ... that 's why he 's on the morning shift . 
hey we qualify for the senior citizens early - bird special ... did you see tommy today ?   he misses you ... 
i do n't remember michael go to sleep .   you do n't have to make conversation with me . 
i watched tv . 
i 'm not saying it 's your fault . 
you got ta get another tour .   we 're gettin ' too old for this . 
i 'm talking about i 've been talking this way for sixteen years and now out of the blue it 's vulgar ! 
jesus mike somebody 's been feeding you a line of crap . 
what was that ? 
c'm on do n't make an issue of it . do you want the fucking meatloaf or not ? 
i 'm sorry .   i know i heard noises ... the detective 's wife ... 
did you hear what i said ? 
it 's not your fault .   mike please get off the case . 
mike take it easy ... 
should i wait up ?   we 've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow . 
coming to bed ? 
i know you 're her bodyguard .   did she buy it or did you ? 
excuse me !   you went to a party with her ? 
what 's wrong with your paisley tie ? 
she took you shopping for a tie ? 
it 's not your taste . 
where 'd you get the tie ? 
oh i can see you 've had a bad day . we 'll see the house another time okay ? 
i 'd identify him . 
because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals .   i ca n't believe you 're talking this way mister detective -- i think she 's got a lot of guts . 
she 's got to identify him . 
honey .   you got him . 
what shit honey ? 
the real estate lady left she could n't wait anymore .   what took you ? 
unbelievably handsome .   you look fantastic in a suit . 
i read the article .   you did n't tell me she was so beautiful . 
let 'em eat their hearts out . 
it 's twenty bucks in the bank . 
changing the sparks .   they showed it on tv .   what d'you think ? 
i can still use a gun . 
for how long ? 
so how 'd it go ? 
imagine ... i 'm sleepin ' with a dt . 
tomorrow i start looking for our house ... you love me ? 
what am i gon na do ?   i jog i do the exercises on tv in the morning ... gravity ... 
i just saw it in the mirror it does n't look like my ass anymore . 
my ass is falling .   it is . 
my ass if falling . 
amen to that .   the supermarket 's full of assholes . 
too kinky . 
let me see . 
be nice . 
well look who 's dressing for success . 
peter parker you have no idea what i did this weekend .   or did n't do . it 's no business of yours either way . 
oh beware of jealousy my lord the green - eyed monster ... 
flash get lost . 
hm .   what a lump . 
i saw him too .   he was silly and obnoxious . 
i was sort of hoping to get out of-- 
what if you get hurt ? 
even if they 're not clever . 
he knew . 
i do n't think he wants me to find him . 
he left .   i could n't believe it-- he just left !   it 's as if he 's somewhere else ... i 'm only getting a piece of him . 
this may be the end of a beautiful friendship you know . 
hm .   well i like you too .   i like your aunt .   i like your shoelaces . i like-- 
hello .   so very boring .   peter parker how do you feel about me this morning ? 
her cleverness that hard edge-- maybe they 're the weakest part of her . the strong part is   what 's underneath .   the part she was protecting .   there 's no reason to protect it ... i think she 's just finding that out now . 
ssh .   i always thought she was a strong person .   she is-- but not for the reasons i thought . 
may 's much better . she 'll be out soon . 
just shut up and close your eyes . this 'll hurt . 
hello .   earth to peter .   are you listening ? 
i know what you mean .   i ... 
listen .   you think you 're responsible for everything that happens .   do n't flagellate yourself - and do n't flatter yourself either .   you 're not the center of the universe . you 're just ... peter . 
some prep school thing . 
you should write that one down . 
god flash can be such a jerk . 
you want to give them something but they 'll just buy more ripple . and they smell so ... bad . 
yeah .   really gets to you if you let it . 
since you 're feeling guilty why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it ? 
he 'll weasel out of trouble . again . 
poor harry .   always desperate for attention .   what about the bunny ? 
no .   i was lying about the coffee . 
i hate your relatives i hate your coffee i hate your shoes . 
i hate people with alliterative names . 
oh .   well i hate you and everyone who looks like you . 
uh is a good start . 
it 's never too early to be clever . describe in a sentence how you feel about me . 
how very dull peter parker . 
what if the world ends tomorrow ? 
even if you 've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written . 
some things you should say anyway . 
maybe i was hiding .   for years i never told ben the one important thing . 
when peter was little he loved to hide .   in closets under the sink . he needed a secret place .   but when i 'd look for him he 'd laugh ... he wanted to be found . 
he 'll be fine . they wo n't tell me anything but i 'm sure he 'll be fine . 
i was napping on the couch .   there was a voice and a shot .   i woke up . ben was looking at me . 
oh ben gets through everything . 
peter you 're bleeding . 
see ?   you big dullard . 
use a fork . 
absolutely no class . 
you were adorable .   the least you could do is use a glass . 
tofu .   ben i wish you would n't . 
it 'll shut itself off . 
yes .   do you have a date ? 
anyway i 've decided to kidnap you for dinner in forest hills-- 
ick .   and those foul chemicals in the pots-- 
--but i did n't feel like getting to know your roaches . 
oh peter . a zit . 
your records are older than you are .   have you never heard of new wave ? 
that 's the understatement of the year . 
i ca n't leave . i 'm already there remember ? 
what makes you think things will be any different this time ? 
i told you time has no meaning here . if you leave you can go anywhere any time . 
yes where would you go ? 
why would you want to leave ? 
yeah . they 're great are n't they ? you can go back and see them born go forward and see your grandchildren . time has no meaning here . 
wherever he wanted to be . 
all of us . 
when the enterprise - b beamed us off the lakul we were partially in the nexus . the transporters locked on to us but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind . 
enjoy them jean - luc . 
for you . this is where you wanted to be . 
you 're in the nexus . 
soran may still be obsessed with getting back . and if he is he 'll do anything to find that doorway again . 
it took a long time but eventually i learned to live with it . and i began to realize that my experience in the nexus had changed me .   i knew things about people about events about time . 
i ca n't remember very much - what it looked like or how long i was there . but i do remember how it felt . 
that ribbon is n't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space . it 's a doorway . it leads to another place- the nexus . it does n't exist in our universe and it does n't play by the same rules either . 
soran does n't care about power or weapons . all he cares about is getting back to the nexus . 
oh yes . i remember everyone who was on the lakul every face . even the ones who did n't make it . 
i 'll go ... 
pon farr . vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life . 
it will be hardest on spock . soon he will feel the burning of his vulcan blood . 
... how long ? 
and spock with it . they are joined together . 
and how many have paid the price for your impatience ? how many have died ? how much damage have you done ... and what is yet to come ? 
so like your father you changed the rules ... 
did your collaborator know ? 
protomatter . an unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable . 
it 's time for total truth between us .   this planet is not what you intended or hoped for is it ? 
i have already made one transmission too many ... 
that may be difficult ... 
logic indicates that is the case . 
it would seem that grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack . 
grissom your message acknowledged . will advise ... out . 
spock 's burial robe . 
but ... how could they have evolved so quickly ... ? 
my readings indicate great instability . 
saavik to grissom . request computer study of soil samples for geological aging . 
... or < u > who</u > . 
cross referenced and verified . an unidentifiable life form reading . 
... radiation residual ... level is minimal ... 
as before ... metallic mass ... verifying triminium photon tube ... no new data . 
new orbit commencing ... coming up on sector three ... 
approximately two meters long ... cylindrical in form ... 
negative on surface ... a manufactured object . 
same sector . metallic mass . 
you must be very proud of what you and your mother have created . 
... fascinating . 
sector three ... sub - tropical vegetation ... temperature --   temperature decreasing rapidly -- 
like your father ... so human .   all units functional recorders are on ... scanning sector one . foliage in fully developed state of growth . temperature twenty- two point two celsius . 
captain what 's happening ? ! 
i 'm sure starfleet would approve sir . 
none that i can detect sir . 
request permission to beam aboard immediately . 
captain this is saavik . come in please ... 
do you have an explanation ? 
captain this is saavik . we have strong life sign readings bearing zero - one - five relative and we are proceeding to investigate . 
i 'll try to remember that captain . 
affirmative captain . our readings are well below danger level . 
captain ... the logical alternative is obvious ... beaming down to the surface is permitted ... 
if equipment is functioning properly indications are -- an animal life form . 
much is at stake ... 
. he will remain always as he is . 
or less . what you describe is called fal tor pan - the refusion . it is very dangerous . the elders may not choose to attempt it . 
the katra ritual is meant to deposit spock 's consciousness in the hall of ancient thought - not in his body . 
yes admiral . but that may not be possible . 
the genesis planet is gone . 
only one thing sir ... get him off this planet ... his aging is part of what 's going on around us ... 
he gave his life to save us . that is all i know . 
he is not himself -- but he lives . he is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet . 
yes he is . and someone else . vulcan scientist of your acquaintance . 
admiral this is lieutenant saavik . 
what are < u > you</u > looking at ? 
oh i believe it . 
the admiral 's son . 
only half of you would get there . 
aye sir -- 
aye sir . on course to ceti alpha . all is well . 
admiral on the bridge ! 
understood sir . 
aye sir . 
three minutes thirty seconds . 
two minutes ten seconds . 
aye sir . 
power levels quite low sir . 
all stop sir . 
at what . 
that was close -- 
' ... no uncoded messages on an open channel ... ' 
but the damage report -- we were immobilized ... 
then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death ... 
< u > what</u > ? 
on the test sir will you tell me what you did ? i 'd really like to know . 
the < u > kobayashi maru</u > sir . 
stage two of what ? 
it does n't make sense . these coordinates are well within regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless . 
that 's true admiral . all the memory cells have been emptied . 
indeterminate life signs . 
begging the admiral 's pardon : general order 15 : ' no   flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort . ' 
on screen ... 
reliant 's command ... 
energize defense fields . 
humor ... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical ... 
may i ask how < u > you</u > dealt with the test ? 
i failed to resolve the situation . 
i did not think so . 
i wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating . 
may i speak sir ? 
it is still regulation admiral . 
as i indicated admiral that thought had not occurred to me . 
... no sir . it has not . 
because ... there was no way to win . 
i do n't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities . 
permission to speak candidly sir ? 
any suggestions admiral ? 
we commend the soul of our brother departed . we love we commit his body to the depths of space . 
prepare for warp speed . 
course heading captain ? 
aft thrusters mr. sulu . 
we 're over our heads . mr. sulu get us out of here . 
inform the klingons we are on a rescue mission ... 
i 'm aware of my responsibilities mister . 
project parabolic course to avoid entering neutral zone . 
you lied . 
by the book ... 
aye sir . 
sir may i quote general order 12 : ' on the approach of any vessel when communications have not been est -- 
aye sir . 
never sir . 
all moorings are clear captain . 
aye sir . 
he 's very human . 
he 's not what i expected sir . 
fire all phasers ... ! 
you -- sent them away . without even letting me say goodbye ? 
why do n't i ? 
sorry if i spoke out of turn . 
i do n't know about you but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence .   i mean whales may not have painted the mona lisa or invented the dirt bike but they did n't ravish the land either . 
bob ... it 's tearing me apart . 
fine . just fine . 
just a couple of kooks ... 
you sure you wo n't change your mind ? 
you 're not one of those guys from the military are you ? trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes or some dipshit stuff like that ? 
so you were at berkeley . 
i suppose they told you that ... ? 
communicate ? communicate what ? you have no right to be here ! 
whoever said the human race was logical ?   now if you 'll follow me i 'll introduce you to the institute 's pride and joy . 
do n't worry . i 'll find < u > you</u > .   see you around the galaxy ... 
why does it have to be goodbye ? 
you 're going to your ship i 'm going to mine . science vessel . i 've got 300 years of catch - up learning to do . 
i belong here .   suppose by some miracle you do get them through .   who in the 23rd century knows anything about humpback whales ? 
... what does that mean ? 
oh my god we 're too late ! 
you need me . 
all right . the frequency is 401 megahertz . 
what do i care ? i 've got nobody but those whales ... 
what are you talking about ? i 'm coming with you . 
yes ... if you have a chart on board i can show you . 
if we keep going up they 'll catch us ! 
what kind of spaceship is this anyway ? 
they were taken last night . i was n't told . they 're in alaska by now . 
kirk . they 're gone . 
but kirk ... 
have i flipped out ? ... is any of this real ? 
it 's true ... what you said ... 
here ... in the park ? 
i bet you 're a damn good poker player . 
so . there we are . 
sorry that 's classified .   i do n't really have a clue who you are ... you would n't want to show me around your space ship would you ? 
do you really think your mighty federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people ? 
i 'll be here . 
mother and son . you arranged this ... ? 
you 're ro'tin are n't you ... ? there 's something in the voice .   would you be his friend gal'na ?   i helped your mother bathe you when you were a child . she still speaks of you . 
there 's a cavern at the base of the next hill ... 
what 's the rush ? 
right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin ... we can hide for days ... 
there are caves in those mountains . 
for someone so young . 
i wonder if you 're aware of the trust you endanger jean - luc picard . in my experience it 's unusual for ... 
i just ... have n't gotten around to it yet . 
it took us centuries to learn that it does n't have to take centuries to learn . 
yes . exactly . nothing more complicated than perception .   you explore the universe . we 've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself ... full of powerful forces ... most people are n't aware enough of the now ... to ever notice them ... 
when time seemed to stop ... and you could almost live in that moment ... 
you 'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday ... stop planning for tomorrow ... until you find ...   let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time ? 
more questions . always the explorer . if you stay long enough that 'll change . 
this is a school ... that 's a student 's work .   she 'll be ready to become an apprentice soon . then in thirty or forty years she 'll take her place among the artisans ... 
... who would n't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth ? i do n't think so . 
you do n't live up to your reputation as an offlander picard . 
but not you . 
we 've always known that to survive we had to remain apart . it has n't been easy . many of the young people here want to know more about the offland ... they 're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life ... 
there 's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet 's rings . it continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies . you must have noticed the effects by now . 
i 've been shot at ... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that 's come to abduct us all ... what 's there to panic about ? 
deceive us ? 
i know what a hologram is captain . the question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village ? 
then you must spend your life answering questions . 
capability yes . but where can warp drive take us except away from here ... ? 
your directive apparently does n't include spying on other cultures . 
it 's not our custom to have guests here at all let alone hold anyone against their will . 
they have an incredible clarity of perception captain . i 've never encountered a species with such mental discipline ... 
we 've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the son'a . 
oh my god are they vegetarians ? that 's not in here ... 
yew - cheen chef - faw ... emphasis on the ' cheen ' and the ' faw ' ... 
... population three hundred million ... 
and have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up ? 
i never kissed you with a beard before . 
on this ship anything can happen . and usually does . 
... doctor crusher has something that 'll take care of that ... 
... i believe you ... 
you 're in quite a mood today . 
why do n't you try sitting up ? 
this is n't one of the usual therapeutic postures ... 
whatever makes you comfortable ... 
come in .   hi . 
no children ? 
was i doing something to your neck ? 
what ... ? 
why would we be involved with these people ? 
hmm i should feel right at home with them ... 
you should feel right at home with them . 
what are they interested in ... ? 
the son'a discovered an m - class planet with humanoid life six months ago . turned out it 's in us to get approval for a sociological study . the federation council suggested it be a joint mission ... 
you want some advice ? do n't do this again .   you know exactly what i mean . 
that might not be so bad ... at least for you . 
you think they 're still up there ? 
he was so confused by what i was doing i do n't think he even noticed .   any word from the enterprise ? 
but i had a little help . surgical transporter . i used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain . 
it was an experience . metal scalpels ... needle and thread ... 
i 'll be fine .   he 's a different story . 
that 'll be interesting . 
he 's stable ... for now .   but it would be better if we could contact ... our friends . 
there must be some good people ... even in this time . 
are you saying they wo n't help us ? 
what are we waiting for ? let 's go . 
jean - luc this man needs medical attention now . 
i 've stabilized him for now ... but he 's in a coma and he 's going to need radiometric therapy . i want to take him to the ship . 
well why did n't you just say so in the first place ? 
but he 's been dead for three hundred ...   oh god ... we 've gone back in time again have n't we ? 
cochrane ... the inventor of warp drive ? 
go where ? hello ? is anyone going to tell me what we 're doing here ? 
montana ? well that answers everything . why the hell are we -- 
the occipital fracture is widening ... we 're going to have to fuse the bones ... 
his automatic reflexes are fluctuating . we 've got to get him on a respirator . 
um ... yeah .   now he 's going to need a respirator . do you have one ? 
at least four hours . 
do it . 
can you configure it ? 
your diagnostics are in error . i need weapons . 
and i need to control this ship . let me into your mind . 
... is to yourself . do n't make me hurt you again ... 
is n't it better like this ... ? 
i 've deactivated the sensory inputs . that flesh on your body is just meat now . 
then take the final step ... give me the enterprise ... and we can be together ... always . 
a universe of sensation is waiting for you ... do n't you want to explore it ... with me ? 
i 'm your creator now . 
have you ever know a woman ? do you know what it 's like to feel her breath on your face ... her skin against yours ... flesh against flesh ? 
more lies . 
you 're becoming more human all the time data . now you 're learning how to lie . 
have they given you what i have given you ? did they even try ? 
they 're not your friends ... they 've held you back ... kept you from your destiny ... 
what a cold description ... for such a beautiful gift . 
do you know what this is data ? 
that 's because you have n't been properly ... stimulated yet . 
you 've taken your first step toward perfection . how does it feel ? 
have you ever wondered what it 's like to have flesh ? 
intelligence ... ambition ... desire ... i bring order to chaos ... 
you 've been interfering with my life ever since i met you .   do n't stop now . 
i do n't care if you 're from france or venus ... just take me with you . 
it 's the future is n't it ? just like you told scrimm .   i knew you were n't from around here . 
where ? and do n't tell me san francisco ... 
you 're leaving are n't you ? 
and all i 'm asking for is the truth . that would take five minutes .   for all i know you caused the explosions at the silo ... and now you 're trying to steal zephram 's ship . 
or ... ? 
all right . truth . i believe that one . why is it so urgent you could n't wait until morning ? 
lie . that 's one . keep going . 
friends from cornell ... 
okay let 's hear it . i 'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house . 
do n't flatter yourself . i take pictures of a lot of junk . 
too bad .   besides it 'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies . 
i 'm sure it is . but it 'll have to wait until tomorrow . 
no ... not like you and doctor crusher used to be . 
you 're not someone who lies very easily ... so it 's obvious when you do ... at least to me . 
you 're lying . 
' fraid not . 
trade . okay . the photographs ... for a straight answer .   who are you ? and how do you know zephram ? 
you 'd have to try real hard . no one 's used currency in over ten years . what are you from another planet ? 
bed sheets .   i used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints . not the best material but i have n't seen a clean piece of paper in five years . 
did you need something ? 
yes ... and i only had enough silver halide for one shot . so you 're lucky you did n't screw it up . 
thank god this plate was already fixed . 
what are you an idiot ? did n't you see the red light was on ? 
take care of him . he 's a very special man . 
soon then .   ill save the last dance for you . 
they 're running me ragged . nothing but question day and night ... i love it ! come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it . there 's a bajoran band at the officer 's mess . 
you can ' t imagine them jean luc . they 're kids ! all with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant . 
that was another time . 
but we do have one advantage .   he needs your blood to live . he might come after you first . 
i ca n't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating . 
as a result the temporal sequencing was never activated . remember he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age . he was engineered to skip thirty years of life . but since the rna sequencing was never activated his cellular structure has started to break down . he 's dying . 
the more i studied his dna the more confusing it got . finally i could only come to one conclusion ... shinzon was created with temporal rna sequencing . he was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly so he could replace you . 
aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels you 're completely normal . 
jean luc whatever you were ... right now you 're the man you 've made yourself . he 's someone else . 
is he very much like you were ? 
he turned out all right . 
he was a bit proud as i recall . 
you 're working late . 
it has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level . i ca n't overestimate the danger of thalaron radiation jean luc . a microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds . 
about twenty - five years ago . they probably used a hair follicle or skin cell . 
if you start tearing up i promise to beam you out . level one medical emergency .   theres no crying in starfleet . 
sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath is n't it ? 
it 'll serve you right . 
but how can he ? he 'll kill you . 
the one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle : me . 
captain -- i might have a way to find them . 
how can you be certain ? 
shinzon 's viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts . i 've become a liability ... i request to be relieved of my duties . 
captain do n't assume he 's anything like you are . you should resist the urge to think you know him . 
sir the strongest sense i had was that he 's more than urious about you . he very much wants to know you .   the same way you want to know him . 
i do n't know . 
i would say he 's been trained to resist telepathy . what i could sense of his emotions were erratic very hard to follow . 
and i you . 
i do n't believe that sir . weve shared many disappointing journeys . 
the b-9 is like a slow child sir . and data in his own way has assumed the position of a parent or guardian . i 'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences . he 'll be disappointed when the bi-9 can not meet those expectations . 
do you have a moment sir ? 
with pleasure captain . 
and you need n't worry . i 'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know . 
really captain it was a lovely toast . 
you 're not here . 
you sick bastard ! 
this is n't real . 
i 'm only half human . 
do you have a good map of death valley ? 
we 're only going to be here a few hours ... 
credit card . 
i 'll take that . 
you have one with two beds ? 
how much are your rooms ? 
thank you . 
where 's that ? 
what was your last stop ? 
where did you stop last ? 
where did you stop last ? 
no ! ! ! no ! ! ! 
i wo n't let anyone hurt you . 
if i do n't speak to mr. shermin i 'm hanging up . 
i want to speak to marc shermin . 
he does n't want to hurt anybody . please leave him alone . 
mr. shermin i 'm hanging up now . if you want to ask me any questions call me at home in a couple of days . i 'm in the book . 
mr ... i 'm sorry what was your name again ? 
i told you . he let me go . i 'm on my way home . 
no . you 'll want to ask a lot of questions i do n't want to answer right now . i already have a ride . 
i do n't know . someplace called elmo 's . look i just wanted to tell you that i 'm all right and i 'm on my way home . 
i will . 
i 'm never going to see you again am i ? 
you say you love me and kiss me ' goodbye . ' 
i said i would get you to your ship and that 's where we 're going to say goodbye . 
where do you think you 're going ? 
oh wow ... i 'll tell you what . when the baby is born we 'll go out in my back yard and wave to you . 
i 'm sure we could find a country and western station . 
how long will it take you to get home ? 
would you put some of your singing in this for the baby ? 
i 'd like to ... 
this is yours ... 
we can . 
what will you say about us ? 
it 'll give you the different countries how they came to be what they are now how america came to be the governments the languages ... everything . 
any words you do n't know you can find in the dictionary . 
it 'll tell you pretty much everything about us ... 
if i ever run into that guy i 'm going to kick his ass . 
the cook again ? 
i do n't need any money for the baby . i 'll be fine . 
you won ten dollars . big deal . if we do n't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship . 
this is crazy . we do n't have time for this . 
here are two quarters . when you lose these you 're not going to get anymore . 
what for ? 
you do n't make money gambling . you lose it . 
i told you it 's impossible for me to have a baby . 
yes they are . 
oh you 're pretty ... 
no they do n't talk ... we talk to them . 
hello ... hello . how are you this morning ? 
you do n't forget anything do you ? 
good morning . 
you 're damn right i am . 
we 'll get a ride in the morning . 
let 's find a place out of the rain . i 'm sure we 'll get a ride in the morning . 
why do n't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late ? 
we 're too far away to walk . do n't you understand ? 
what are you saying ? 
what do you want from me ? there are no cars on this road . i did n't ask for this stupid storm . 
i will . i will . we still have another day . 
no one 's traveling in this weather . 
we 're not going to get a ride tonight . 
where did you learn that ? 
we 're hundreds of miles from where you have to be . 
why ca n't we wait here for a ride ? 
where are you going ? 
come on . 
you shit ! i 'll decide if i go or not . not you . i do n't know what you do on your planet but i did n't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did . 
please understand . if you go this way you 'll never get to your ship . the police know about lathrop wells . we have to go another way . i 'll get you to your ship . i promise . 
the police know about lathrop wells . we have to go another way . come on . 
the police are waiting for you up ahead . there 's a roadblock . you have to go back . 
no . i 'm just not tired . let 's go . 
i 'm not sleepy anymore . let 's drive for a little while longer . 
no . get in . 
hurry up . 
you should n't drink so much of that stuff . it 's bad for you . 
put that back . 
yes . sing some more . 
that was beautiful . 
do n't be afraid ... i 'd really like to hear it . 
i 'd like to hear it . can you sing something ? 
do you have music up there ? 
i 've noticed ... do you understand what they 're saying ? 
i do n't know . 
nobody knows . 
what are you doing ? 
it 's bad . 
sounds like your captain 's going to get hell when he gets back home . 
the police should n't have started shooting . but you can hardly blame them . you surprised them . they did n't know you were up there . when they saw you they thought you were here to hurt us . 
a friend is a person that is good to you ... someone you like to be with ... someone you like to laugh with ... 
oh that 's terrible . i 'm sorry . was he a good friend ? 
the captain ... 
you did ? that 's funny . so did we . 
stars ... when a sun is far away we call it a ' star . ' 
you thought we were a different planet ? ! 
why did your ship land on this planet ... on earth ? 
what happened ? 
it 's a kiss ...   goodbye ... 
yes . i have a long ride ahead of me ...   goodbye . 
well ... i 'm going to go now . 
do n't be afraid . do what i told you and you 'll be okay . 
do n't worry . they 're not going to hurt you . come on .   only show this to the driver . nobody else . and do n't lose it . 
tomorrow morning . start hitch - hiking right away and ... 
not every car but ... a car will stop ... maybe not the first car ... maybe number eight number fifteen ... 
your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride . 
you keep this . now this is hitch- hike ...   you stand on the side of the road the highway ... you understand ? and you face the cars going in the direction you want to go . when you see a car or a truck coming you stick out your thumb like this ... 
then do n't be smart . 
you want this ticket ? 
right . in omaha the driver will put you on the bus for salt lake city and the new driver will take ...   ... this part . when you get to salt lake city ask the driver ' las vegas please ' ... 
will you please do it my way ? you 'll get into trouble if you do n't . if anybody talks to you tell them ... i do not speak english . 
the driver will ... 
say it . 
that 's easy . i 'll explain that in a minute . this is your ticket . when you get on the bus here the driver will take this part . you will ride to omaha . when you get to omaha ask the driver . ' salt lake city please . i do not speak english . ' 
i know that . but the buses do n't go there . 
i ca n't ... forget the baby . okay ? the closest i was able to get you was lathrop wells . you 'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way . 
i 'd love to have a baby . but i ca n't ... 
no ... the closest ... 
eh ... yes ... 
the closest i was able to get you was lathrop wells ... 
do you understand what i 'm saying to you ? you can keep the car .   that should be enough for gas from here to there . please let me go . 
i feel like i 'm going crazy here . you 're scott . but he 's dead . i do n't know what 's real anymore . i ca n't be here with you . 
then let me go . you do n't need me . 
you 'll keep the car . i 'll take a bus ...   am i going up there with you ... in your ship ... up there ? 
i wo n't tell anybody if that 's what you 're worried about . i promise . you 'll keep ... 
that 's not much time . i 'll just slow you down . i have to sleep . i 'm very tired . and i have to wash and eat . you do n't ... 
how many days and nights do you have to go ...   ... here ? 
sun ... day . no sun ... night . you understand ? 
how will i do this one ? ... 
when do you have to be here ? 
why are you going here ? what is here ? 
you better . 
you did n't even see it . 
that was a red light ! ! i told you you have to stop at a red light ! ! 
what 's the matter ? 
this stuff could kill ...   be my guest . 
you want to try it ? 
a drink . 
satisfied ? now get out . out . 
in your pocket please ... 
oh god ! you 're going to get us both killed . okay ... in your pocket ... 
attendant . he 'll give us gas . put the gun down . under the seat . under the seat ... 
stop ! ! enough ! ! jesus ! you 're worse than a parrot ! ! 
no no ... do n't say that . bad word . 
no . i do n't know what you are but you 're not scott . 
my ... husband . 
i know . 
up there ... i ... eh ... ca n't explain ...   but that 's the only place you could be from . 
are you from up there ? space ? 
that 's a big help . where are you from ? 
who are you ? 
i am jenny haydn . 
not what . who . what is for things .   what ? what ? what ? what ? for people you use who . who is he ?   who is she ?   who are you ?   who am i ? 
you 'll see . 
it 's closed ... closed . we need one that 's open . 
yes . very good . 
no gas ... car dead .   we need gas . i do n't want to get shot for running out of gas . 
this car runs on gas . 
no gas . 
you 're full of tricks are n't you ? 
what are you doing ? 
we 're going to have to stop for gas soon . 
which way ? 
eh ... police . 
gear shift . 
steering wheel . 
steering wheel ... 
ah ... no ... 
which way do you want to go ? 
why are you doing this to me ? i 'll give you whatever ... 
do n't ... do n't do this ... please ... 
he does n't understand ... just walk away ... 
help me ! ! ! 
call the police ! ! 
he 's kidnapping me ! ! ! 
help me ! ! 
do n't worry . i 'll be all right . 
it 's easier not to tell if you do n't know . 
pull over . i 've got to get back there . 
if he did n't want to go through the roadblock is there any other way to get to vegas ? 
what ? no of course not . 
i do n't know where he is . 
i told you i 'm looking for someone . 
slow down slow down . 
you sure this is your car ? 
you said you were going to get her out of this . 
i made my choice lenny . 
look tran ... lenny just came by to give me some bad news .   an old friend of mine has been murdered . you remember iris ? 
you 're too goddamned paranoid . 
leave him alone tran . 
we have nothing to talk about lenny . 
' we might as well make the best of it . ' 
uh huh .   and i said ' that 's good because i like the feeling of someone watching me .   i acquired the taste from lenny . ' 
i know .   i do n't always do exactly what i 'm told .   so i said ' do you enjoy watching me ? '   and you said -- come on max . 
my god . 
you ca n't just ... kill him . 
what 're you going to do ? 
oh my god .   i do n't believe this is happening . 
what a nightmare . 
you think tran killed her ? 
so finally he gives iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do . 
we should talk alone . 
oh god lenny .   i was trying to keep you out of this . 
what 's going on ? 
you do n't know what you 're fucking with here . 
then what ?   then what lenny ? !   you going to protect me ?   big tough guy . you 're a talker lenny .   you do n't even have a gun . 
who did it ? 
you 're crazier than i thought lenny .   coming here ... tran 's just in there . 
yeah for about a month now .   lenny just stay away from tran okay ?   and stay away from me .   stop trying to rescue me .   those days are over . i 'm a big girl now .   stop trying to save me okay because i do n't need saving ... just ... give up on me . 
you have to get out of here .   if tran catches you he 'll ... he 's acting crazy .   he 's doing way too much playback and he 's getting completely paranoid .   he 's such a control freak he 's even paying max to follow me around . 
damn right . 
he has his uses too . 
that 's a good one coming from you . 
let it alone lenny .   it 'll take care of itself . 
well i have n't seen her in months . who knows what 's going on in her head .   you 're really running out of excuses to come around are n't you ? 
you talked to iris ?   when ? 
you have to go .   i mean it . 
i know .   lenny if tran finds you talking to me he 'll hurt you . 
no lenny . 
i do n't think that 's a good idea lenny . 
cut it out tran . 
make me forget it baby . 
i do n't feel anything .   is it on ? 
i feel like you 're turning me into a vcr . 
hey you going to watch or you going to do ? 
yeah .   see you there . 
well ...   get going .   you 're still bleeding . 
hey lenny .   we made it . 
are we under arrest ? 
yeah right .   fucked . 
oh boy .   what if you 're wrong ? 
a cop ?   you want me to trust a cop ? ! 
that 's the original .   there are no copies . 
and do what ?   take on his whole posse ? 
uh unh . 
no .   they must have sent it to my beach house by mistake . 
good lenny .   i can see why the detective gig did n't work out .   come on . 
no it 's not . 
you never told me . 
no .   it did n't . 
i guess . 
yeah .   lenny .   i have . 
lenny ... shutup .   just park your mouth and listen .   it 's a set - up . think about it !   why 's he been sending you tapes ?   to freak you get you to rush in without thinking . then they put one in you put one in her put the gun in your hand ... crime of passion .   this guy 's bent enough to think of that . 
i 'm not going . 
why did n't he just go public with the tape ?   save himself that way . 
who 's strickland ? 
the only card we have to play is the tape .   you know we get it to the media somehow ... 
how long does it last ?   oh . 
i still ca n't square the psycho smarts of whoever did iris with those two cops . 
yeah .   you gave up your hot tub tape to save me .   that 's real progress for you . 
well look at the plus side . 
people finding out ... seeing ... that the lapd just flat out executed jeriko one .   jesus .   maybe they ought to see . 
you know what this tape could do if it gets out . 
i see .   i see the earth opening up and swallowing us all . 
uh unh .   i wo n't do it . 
tell me . 
you sure ? 
i ca n't believe we had to give them the damn tape . 
fire 's out is n't it ? 
this is bad . 
it 's okay lenny   they 'd never get here in time anyway . 
lenny .   calm down .   this is what i do . 
take it easy .   the glass is bullet resistant . 
lenny give them the tape . 
something in your car ... 
think back about what she said . exactly what she said . 
lenny have you lost it completely ? 
you better keep a low profile for a while . 
will you relax .   there 's nobody back there . 
what is it ? 
where we going ? 
whatup lenny ? 
i 'm sorry about getting on your case earlier .   i just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper and i -- anyway .   i 'm sorry . 
ok .   he asks about you all the time . it 's been weeks since you 've seen him . 
now you 're really getting paranoid . 
that 's where it gets a little strange . 
okay so he 's a freak who thinks he 's sane pretending to be a freak . the point is he was a hitter . somebody wanted to shut her up .   but why not just put a little lead in her ear ? 
so the guy 's not a sicko . 
because iris knew somebody was after her . 
but that does n't add does it . 
it 's not your fault . 
no more lenny . 
do n't crank the gain any more . you 're gon na fry yourself . 
so that gives you something . 
you ever wonder why you get beat up a lot ? 
so some psycho wire - freak gets to keep running around-- 
this guy is someone you know one of your squid - head contacts . 
cause you 're the man right ?   the magic man .   if it 's got something to do with the wire sooner or later it washes up on your beach . 
and gives it to you . 
are you sure it 's real ? 
blackjack ?   i do n't understand-- 
my god lenny .   what is it ? 
what is it ? 
what 's that ?   present from faith ? 
what i 'm saying .   but you still come out this goofball romantic . 
you 're some piece of work you know that .   just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl and somehow you never let it touch you . i mean between vice and this so- called occupation you 're in now you must 've seen it all . 
destiny ?   you living in a perfume commercial ?   she 's a hard - climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride . 
she thinks you 're a bucket of dog vomit .   trust me on this . 
forget her . 
guy named wade beemer .   used to be a running back for the rams in ' 96 and ' 97 . 
sure lenny .   the only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love . 
jesus lenny . 
yeah .   i do n't see a way out of it . 
look i got ta get some sleep . 
lenny you 're turning into some kinda squid - head low - life .   you 're always broke you just go from one score to the next .   and you 're getting strung out ... you do n't even see it .   getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer . 
no you 're just trying to get off . 
no see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another .   you just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act .   well i 'm out .   i got a kid i got rent i got an ex- husband someplace who does n't send me a dime of support ... i 'm just trying to hold on here . 
i 've had it .   no more wirehead shit in my car .   you understand ?   you want to poach your lobes do it somewhere else . 
get it . 
i 've had enough of this shit .   you 're on foot lenny . 
are we having a bad night ? 
you will not live to see the morning . 
what the fuck are you doing ? 
define love . 
me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months . 
lenny this shit 's illegal . 
price he pays for being a scumsucking pig . 
uh huh i wanna hear this part . 
buncha techno - perv jerkoffs . 
so what 's up with you ?   another busy night selling porno to wireheads ? 
driving mr. lenny . 
jeez you 're pathetic .   okay i got a pickup at the st. james .   i 'll take you there you can get a cab . 
lenny this may be a hard concept for you but friends do n't have to pay their friends . 
excuse me .   what part of no do n't you understand ? 
sleaze to peddle . 
whoa whoa whoa .   i said i 'd drop you home but i 'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds .   i 've already pulled twelve hours today . 
greetings gents .   so let 's hear this week 's sad story . 
we 're going to aunt cecile 's honey . we 're going to watch fireworks from there .   let 's go .   chop chop . 
well give me some then ... i 'm starving . 
what is that ? 
are you going to make me beg ? 
just lenny . 
yeah well maybe it 's time for a war ! 
so you 're saying we just pretend is did n't happen ?   it happened !   the lapd executed one of the most important black men in america !   who the fuck are you to bury this ? ! 
this seems a little sophisticated for them .   these are not subtle guys . 
take the tape to the cops . 
maybe he just figures lenny will appreciate what he 's created .   it 's the dark end of the street lenny . how do you like it now ? 
but i mean is n't he faith 's new-- 
hey is n't that tran vo ? 
no .   i have n't noticed because i make my payments .   so max pelcher how 's the p.i. business ? 
just step outside sir . now . keep your hands where i can see them . 
deputy director get out sir . 
serial killer killed . in ft . myers . cut up in his van . and this time we got a witness . 
we have another one . 
sorry to interrupt you sir but i thought you 'd like to know . 
maybe cause he 's smart . 
just an observer . 
what happened ? 
how are we going to find him ? 
it 's a truck . a refrigerated truck . 
it 's quite advanced . 
what 's going on ? 
you okay ? 
tom you okay ? 
could be a lot of things . depends on the freezer .   i 'm sorry mack but i do n't think this is the answer . 
mack i 'm just trying to keep up with now . 
you 're putting me in a difficult position . 
it 's okay to be wrong just do n't be dead wrong . 
i 'd be real careful if i were you . 
koessler does n't know any of this ? 
does one exist ? 
and you 're working with him ? 
slow down a second you met with low -- 
what 's going on ? 
this feels like something out of a spy novel . 
but he believes in it . that 's all that matters . he toyed with you you toy with him . convince him you 've got a lead on suspect zero . use zero you 'll find low . 
suspect zero . 
you want to get him ? find something he wants . get him to come to you . 
i 'm in omaha . get to the airport . there 's been another one . 
where are you ? everybody 's looking for you . 
i just need to go a little slow . 
that 's my point . remember you 're a cop pretending to be a deviant . it 's not the other way around . 
and nobody else can do that ? 
you need time to think . about the case about you and me . 
then there 's the other issue . 
there 's the agency issue . i think koessler may suspect something already . we 're not on the best footing with him as it is . 
no i mean maybe we should back off a bit you and me . 
maybe we should back off a bit . 
i came over because i could n't sleep and was lonely . i wanted to see you . i thought i 'd surprise you . 
mack i 'm sorry . i apologize . i should have called . i had no right to sneak in on you like that . 
you should have seen the store manager at parade of shoes . she was inconsolable . 
not yet . this time they 're waiting for you . 
you found the body . she was one of harold speck 's victims . in el paso .   they 're not just talking to each other mack they 're trading souvenirs . 
sue ann hanson . 
we 're trying to match them with dump site bodies .   this we know is carol delview from tampa found her last spring . this one -- 
we did find these however . 
no . cut off while he was still alive look at his wrists damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free . must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain - sawed his throat . unfortunately he 'd soundproofed his van . 
not yet . not about this either . 
just routine stuff . 
he 's called a couple times . 
i 've been thinking about this . 
it 's a no - no . 
there are agency regulations about this . 
because you asked him to stupid . 
no mack i do not think you 're a square and definitely not a nerd . 
of course he did . he came on to every attractive student . which bothers you most : that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me ? 
do n't be too harsh . 
he 's a consultant to a network tv program on profilers . he gets a check every episode . 
i was thinking maybe we should ask professor daitz . nobody knows this stuff better . 
my guess : he 's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae . 
what 's this country coming to ? 
grown man dressed like a clown . does he really think he looks good ? 
and one other thing . 
i was going to be a physician i am a physician but i kept drifting over to criminal psych . this seems to be the best of both . my parents still have n't forgiven me . 
you got a point there . 
this is some serious shit . 
they 're all criminals ? 
you want to have dinner ? 
that 's part of the reason i dropped by . i need to learn this stuff . 
what about the chat rooms themselves ? 
maybe it does n't matter if he 's a good dancer cause it 's a slow song if that 's what he 's afraid of . 
you do n't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with ? 
like if i meet a handsome young man and i wanted to ask him to dance ? i can do that ? 
to do what ? 
what else ? 
like what ? 
oh god . that 's two more than me . tell me it gets better . 
i thought i was going to die . 
you too ? 
well i left someone very special behind . 
well it was n't the simple but yeah . 
... so i thought what the hell they make movies in l.a. not in michigan so i moved here . 
why ? you 're not a real man ? 
i thought real men do n't like quiche . 
yes . like the quiche . 
hi mike . i 'm lorraine . 
you did n't have to get off the other line . i would 've called you back . 
i can call back ... 
are you on the other line ? 
hi mike ? 
... well it suits you ... 
... which one ... ? 
can i give you a ride to your car ... ? 
... home . it 's getting late . yeah . 
well i should be getting ... 
hey at least it 's not goofy . 
neither is acting . not if you 're serious about it .   can i have one of these ? 
did n't you tell me to be patient with my career ? 
it 's not going to well ? 
i 'll have to come see you sometime . 
you 're a comedian ? 
let me get a pen out of my car .   do you have something to write on ? 
i 'll be around . 
me too . 
well ... this is it . 
you said there are advantages to being single . i want to know what the advantages are . 
will you give this letter to michael . 
will you give this to him . 
listen tom i let my cab go ; can i come in to call another one ? 
what was that ? 
i 've tried calling and writing .   i want to reach michael . 
is it true ? 
tell me ! 
michael it 's not true .   please tell me . 
will you ? 
connie and carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy . 
why are you so cold to her and carlo ?   they live with us on the mall now but you never get close to them . 
your sister wants to ask you something . 
wake me up when you come to bed ? 
do n't you want dinner first ? 
oh michael . 
when will i see you again ? 
when will i see you again ? 
my parents do n't read the daily news .   all right if you think i should n't .   i ca n't believe the things the papers are printing . i 'm sure most of it 's not true . 
can i go to the hospital with you ? 
please say it . 
tell me you love me . 
can you say it ? 
i love you . 
i love you . 
how is your father ? 
would you like me better if i were ingrid bergman ? 
would you like me better if i were a nun ? 
hello ... this is long distance .   i have a call from new hampshire .   mr. michael corleone .   one moment please . 
michael what are you doing ? 
what time do they expect us ? 
what will your father say ? 
just you . 
we have something for your mother for sonny we have the tie for fredo and tom hagen gets the reynolds pen ... 
i used to come down to new york whenever he sang at the capitol and scream my head off . 
i did n't know your family knew johnny fontane . 
if he 's your brother why does he have a different name ? 
how do you do . 
he 's coming over here ! 
i never know when you 're telling me the truth . 
michael i love you . 
michael i do n't want to hear anymore ... 
michael you 're trying to scare me ... 
al capone ! 
you know i love spaghetti . 
yes .   tell me . 
who is he ? 
why do they bother him on a day like this ? 
they 're talking to themselves . 
michael what are those men doing ? 
i 've never seen anything like it . 
well she was already dead darling was n't she so i suppose -- 
it 's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- freddie fausto peter smith - kingsley -- he 's wonderful -- did you meet him he 's a musician ? -- ... and especially you of course ... and that 's only the boys . 
if you 're not at my place by 7.00 tom and i are running off together . 
dubious but special honor tom -- crewing dickie 's boat . alright bar 's open . 
oh it was . 
bastard !   is n't it great tom ? i found it in naples . i bargained for about two weeks . 
oh darling -- is that for me ? 
it 's the one task dickie can do on his own -- make coffee . 
i do n't like you . 
no i like him . 
okay darling . 
it 's vile . 
i 'll come down . 
hi tom . 
i do n't get it . 
what ? what ? 
i 'll do it . i make a fabulous martini . 
shut up ! 
tom was telling me about his trip over . made me laugh so much i got a nosebleed . 
yes tom ripley 's here . 
well we ate everything without you . 
you just woke up ! 
did you forget where i live ? it 's four o'clock . 
and be careful in the sun . your gray 's in danger of turning a little pink . 
you should come and have lunch with us before you go -- dickie ? 
how do you do . 
i do n't know i do n't know i just know it . 
such as ? 
i just do n't believe that ! 
where 's mr maccarron ? 
i know it was you -- i know it was you tom . i know it was you . i know you killed dickie . i know it was you . 
why do i think there 's never been a ripley rainy day ? 
what are you going to do now tom ? 
i do n't believe a single word you 've said . 
i do n't believe you . 
why ? when ? 
why do you have dickie 's rings ? 
i was looking for a needle and thread . i was n't snooping . i was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra . 
he promised me . i swear i 'll never take off this ring until the day -- 
i have to tell mr greenleaf . i have to tell mr greenleaf . i have to tell mr greenleaf . 
dickie promised me he would never take off this ring . 
you 've got dickie 's rings . 
i found dickie 's rings . 
tom i need to talk to you . it 's urgent . 
poor man .   we were knocking on that door for ever .   i think i 've broken my strap . 
did dickie 's dad go ? 
to the manner born . 
he 's american . he 's already discovered dickie cashed checks for $ 1000 the day before he disappeared . 
dickie has n't killed himself . i 'm sure of that . there 's a private detective on the case now -- a mr maccarron -- dickie 's father 's employing him . 
hello peter so good to see you . 
perhaps i should n't go either . 
where does dickie live ? 
i tried again waiting here watching for him . instead it 's you . whenever i look for dickie i find you .   what happened to your face ? 
tell me the truth . did he kill freddie ? 
did he kill freddie ? 
he was there with someone . so i suppose she must have dragged him -- that 's not fair . i 'm going back to mongi . i think dickie 's coming home .   i 'm going to go home . 
dickie was at the opera last night . 
you were going to venice . 
is he really not here ? 
is he here ? are you with dickie ? 
oh my god . tom . 
he hates being confronted . 
how long 's he staying for ? 
thanks . he knows i love this although why it could n't have waited ... 
is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone ? 
what does that mean ? 
ha . did he say why ? 
where 's dickie ? 
yes -- i 'm on a good streak thanks . 
tom you startled me ! you 're back . 
i 'll go . 
did n't dick say ? -- he talked to freddie ... apparently it 's not going to work out --   freddie says there are n't enough rooms . 
tell me why is it when men play they always play at killing each other ... ? i 'm sorry about cortina by the way . 
he 's not even aware of it . when you 've got his attention you feel like you 're the only person in the world . that 's why everybody loves him . other times ... 
the thing with dickie -- it 's like the sun shines on you and it 's glorious then he forgets you and it 's very very cold . 
are you okay ? 
you really should go in it 's marvelous . 
tom i love you !   see !   i bought it for him for his birthday . 
dickie you ca n't even drive a car ! no what we need urgently is an icebox . what do you think tom ? agree with me and i 'll be your friend for life . 
which is ridiculous . boats are female everyone knows you ca n't call a boat after a man . 
i never said that ! 
hello tom . you 're off ? what are your plans ? 
what 's going on ? 
how would you know that ? 
i told you ! i knew it ! 
dickie ? do you know dickie ? 
no nothing . i 'm just thinking about when tom arrived in mongi .   and now look at you . 
a hotel would 've been fine .   we 'll have to tell mr greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched . 
this is spectacular . 
golly . who 's paying for this ? 
is this you ? 
he 's not coming till the morning . evidently his stomach -- i do n't think the food here is agreeing with him . 
so you found peter ... 
i hope so . 
do you know tom ? 
i do n't know her .   he has n't called he 's hardly written just these cryptic notes . you do n't just dump people . 
no glasses . 
he told me everything . i was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago so i ... i 'm going to go now i think . unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel would n't it ? 
marge i do n't know you so i have no right but dickie loves you . he 's -- i think you 'll find he 's coming home to you . 
you were at the opera ? well that explains -- yes i was there . i was there with dickie . 
dickie are you with peter smith- kingsley ? i bet you are . my aunt thought she saw him . 
so -- are you travelling under r ? 
you know the whole world thinks you killed freddie ? it 's terrible . 
you 're kidding . 
when i thought about you i was mostly hating you . where 've you been hiding ? 
and co. a lot of co. oh god i 've thought about you so much . 
hardly . i could n't be less alone . 
i was looking at you your clothes i would n't have known you ... 
dickie my god ! 
i do n't -- is that by the spanish steps ? 
will you meet me tomorrow ? just to say goodbye in the daylight properly ? so it 's not just this it 's too ... you should always save pain for daylight ... 
beating you away . 
no i absolutely understand . of course . 
do n't worry . really . do n't worry . 
okay then you 're crazy . 
you 're crazy ! it 's freezing out there . 
i thought you were enjoying yourself ? 
show me the other one again .   i like them both . 
i 've never admitted that to anyone . 
the truth is if you 've had money your entire life even if you despise it which we do -- agreed ? -- you 're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it . 
sorry i would n't have made a joke if -- 
now ? i do n't think so . but i 've met him of course and we 've chatted and i know about you and marge and mongi and what an unreliable rat you are . freddie said you were a rat and i thought to myself now i know why he travels under r. 
everybody knows freddie miles . 
at christmas . to cortina with freddie miles and -- 
but you 're going skiing with us yankees are n't you ? 
as in the textile logues . trying to shrug off the dress . i travel under my mother 's name too . 
the funny thing is i 'm not randall either . i 'm logue . 
which is ? 
so now did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile ? it 's just -- upstairs -- were n't you under the r stand ? i thought i saw you there . 
you 're not the shipping greenleaf 's ? 
i 'm meredith by the way . meredith randall . 
no it 's just -- you are american are n't you ? -- no i just i have so much luggage and you 're so uh streamlined . it 's humiliating . 
what 's your secret ? 
maybe i 'll see you again sometime huh ? 
thank you travis . 
how are you travis ? i read about you in the papers . 
yes . it wo n't be long now . seventeen days . 
hello travis . 
keep it . 
i 'm getting a taxi . 
it 's very simple . you go your way i 'll go mine . thanks anyway travis . 
no i do n't feel so good . we 're just two very different kinds of people that 's all . 
no travis . you 're a sweet guy and all that but i think this is it . i 'm going home . 
my god ! 
i mean porno movies . 
you mean these are the only kind of movies you go to ? 
these are not the kind of movies i go to . 
i 'm leaving . 
what 's wrong ? 
but this is a porno movie . 
what are you doing ? 
so you have n't heard this record yet ? 
your stereo broke ? god i could hardly stand that . i live on music . 
travis you have n't even played the record ? 
you did n't have to spend your money -- ? 
kris kristofferson . 
the singer ? 
you know what you remind me of ? 
you must be rich . 
you mean you work seventy - two hours a week . 
what hours do you work ? 
that 's very romantic . some of your fares must be interesting . see any stars politicians deliver any babies yet ? 
well i do n't go to the plaza every night . 
that would have been quite a coincidence . 
the dmz ? 
you 're right ! now i remember ! it was after the western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late . the next day i was completely bushed . it was unbelievable . 
three in the morning ? i do n't think so . i have to go to bed early . i work days . it must have been somebody else . 
com'on travis . it 's not that bad . i take lots of taxis . 
the moon ? 
that 's really something . 
what did you do ? 
what kind of people ? 
after this job i 'm looking forward to being alone for a while . 
so why did you decide to drive a taxi at night ? 
where do you live ? 
travis i never ever met anybody like you before . 
we 've signed up 15000 palantine volunteers in new york so far . the organizational problems are becoming just staggering . 
thank you travis . 
all right .   all right . i 'm taking a break at four o'clock . if you 're here then we 'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie . 
i do n't know ... 
well then what is it you exactly want to do ? 
well we 're all working tonight . 
if you talk to tom he 'll assign you to something . 
well that 's not exactly what the senator has proposed . you might not want to canvass but there is plenty more other work we need done : office work filing poster hanging . 
you want to canvass ? 
charles palantine . the man you want to volunteer to help elect president . 
is that so ?   but what do you think of charles palantine ? 
no i do n't think so .   that 's someone else . 
what is it ? i 'm busy . 
no this is young -- well i 'm never sure how old black people are -- but anyway he is n't old . that 's for sure . 
no stupid . with the stubs . that 's the whole point . 
first he 's not italian . second he 's not a thief . i noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change . two of his fingers are missing . just stubs . like they were blown away . i was putting my change in my purse when i saw him get out a cigarette . i could n't help watching . i was dying to see how he 'd light it . 
why do n't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary ? 
as i said he is n't italian . besides i thought they just killed them . 
he 's black ok ? 
no why ? 
he happens to be missing fingers . i first noticed when -- 
no . i just wanted to see if you could light it that way . the guy at the newsstand can . 
oh are you all right ? 
this i got ta see . 
try holding the match like this . 
i do n't know -- but it feels like a long time . 
that taxi driver . the one that 's been sitting here . 
why 's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us ? 
have you been noticing anything strange ? 
that 's the last . the finish . period . some people can learn . some people ca n't . and you wonder why we never get serious -- 
alright now . you want to know why cbs has the highest ratings ? you think their news is any different from nbc abc ? it 's all the same news . same stories . same order usually . what you thought they had good news for people right ? you thought that 's why people watched cbs ? i 'll tell you why people watch cbs . cronkite . the man . you got it ? not the news not the issues the man . if walter cronkite told people to eat soap they 'd do it . we are selling cars goddamn it . 
maybe if you 'd try thinking once in a while you 'd get somewhere . 
just what ? 
alright forget it if you 're not going to be serious 
have you ever wondered why cbs news has the highest ratings ? 
oh tom please . 
first push the man then the issue . senator palantine is first of all a dynamic man an intelligent interesting fascinating man . 
andy usually just sends those to the national media . the local press does n't know what to do with a position paper until upi and ap tell them anyway . 
tom come here a moment .   i think this canvas report is about ready to go out . check it out with andy and if he okays if have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county .   and do n't forget to add the new photo releases . 
what do you mean ? 
you do n't have to . 
i sure hate to go alone ... 
sure you do n't want to come with me ? 
do you really think i should go to the commune ? 
you 're not much with girls are you ? 
god . i know where they should have a commune for you . they should have a commune for you at bellevue . 
sport never treated me bad honest . never beat me up once . 
what should i do ? call the cops ? 
just leave'em . there 's plenty of other girls . 
god i do n't know who 's weirder you or me . 
you a narc ? 
what 's so important ? 
you a scorpion ? that 's it . you 're a scorpion . i can tell . 
why not ? 
why do n't you come to a commune with me ? 
rock music died in 1970 that 's what i think . before that it was fantastic . i can tell you that . everybody was crashing hanging out at the fillmore . me and my girlfriend ann used to go up the fire escape you know ? it was unbelievable . rock stars everywhere . that airplane -- that 's my group man . all libras . but now everybody 's split or got sick or busted . i think i 'll move to one of those communes in vermont you know ? that 's where all the smart ones went . i stayed here . 
what makes you so high and mighty ? did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror . you do n't get eyes like that from ... 
i think cancer 's make the best lovers . my whole family are air signs . 
i 'm a libra too . that 's why we get along so well . 
he never killed nobody . he 's a libra . 
who 's a killer ? 
god you are square . 
did n't you ever hear of women 's lib ? 
why do you want me to go back to my parents ? they hate me . why do you think i split ? there ai n't nothin there . 
... and after that sport and i just started hanging out ... 
well you want to or not ? 
sure . all right . we 'll have breakfast . i get up about one o'clock . tomorrow . 
that 's not hard to do . 
i understand mister . it means something really . 
i was stoned . that 's why they stopped me . when i 'm not stoned i got no place else to go . they just protect me from myself . 
i can leave anytime i want . 
i think so . i tried to get into your cab one night and now you want to come and take me away . 
you can do it in my mouth . 
do n't you want to make it ?   ca n't you make it ? 
oh come off it man . 
i musta been stoned . 
why should i want to get out of here ? this is where i live . 
you want to make it like this ? 
we better make it or sport'll get mad . how do you want to make it ? 
i do n't remember . 
why ? who are you ? 
that 's what you think . 
i do n't like my real name . 
it 's easy to remember . easy lay . 
it 's your time mister . fifteen minutes ai n't long .   that cigarette burns out your time is up . 
a girl needs protection . 
all right .   you see that guy over there ?   his name is sport . go talk to him . i 'll wait here . 
you looking for some action ? 
and   i love you pete ! 
pete i 'm so sorry about what they did to you .   i did n't think you 'd come back i thought you 'd want to write again ... 
tell them pete .   tell them ... 
just remember two things .   first the law is a living thing .   it made us free and it keeps us free . sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes . sometimes it makes mistakes sometimes big mistakes .   but in the end the law prevails for the just . sometimes it takes a while . 
not exactly light reading i know . believe it or not i 've read this since high school and it got me all the way through law school . besides there 's something in there that 'll help you .   you wo n't have to get very far it 's near the beginning . 
did you bring along something to read ? 
and who 's gon na run the projector until you get back ?   mrs. terwilliger ? 
you 'll be fine .   no matter what leo kubelsky says you 've got a hundred and seventy - five years of american law on your side .   do n't forget that . 
you 've got everything ? 
whatever happens . 
i am too . 
forget about all that .   you want to do the right thing ?   then defend your name .   if someone says something about you that 's untrue you have to stand up and say so .   i know the law and the law 's on your side . 
but if you only went to one meeting why does anyone care ? besides why should it even matter if you were a communist ? 
i believe you . 
you know it 's going to take me a while to get used to calling you pete .   pete .   pete .   it 's a nice name . 
oh yes .   yes he was . 
i 'm sure a lot of people down in l.a. are worried sick about you . 
besides daddy 's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working . 
daddy that 's luke can you let him in ?   i 'll be right down . 
you mean   me ? 
... including me .   right ?   
yeah well it 's not everyday you get   news like this .   you 're sure he 's   okay ?   other than the   bump on the head ? 
i think   it 's worse   now . 
not as bad as i thought it would . i think i passed . 
no ... i ca n't ... i have to ... i ca n't ... 
i see ... 
what ... do you remember ? 
it never used to be .   you were two left feet on the dance floor .   like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step . 
your dancing 's very good . 
alex and charlie ?   simple .   alex is the smarter one . 
oh .   okay . 
now did you remember that or ... 
exactly .   and he got good . 
you had a hidden agenda though . see when he was five or six little spence used to follow you around like a puppy .   bothered the hell out of you .   but as soon as you gave him the clarinet ... 
back in ' 37 you heard benny goodman play for the first time so you went out and got a used clarinet .   you wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him . you tried hard but it was n't long before it was clear that benny goodman would never be looking over his shoulder .   so you gave the clarinet to spencer . 
no they 're not .   i 'd say your investment was paying dividends . 
you tried to once .   it was pretty pitiful . 
when did you start smoking ? 
well there 's got to be a way ... 
what about a loan ?   you could go to the bank ... ? 
nine hundred ... 
you know everyone 's so excited about the bijou re - opening ... 
we 've done this before so many times .   the last time was so long ago but it feels like yesterday . 
this is strange .   do you feel it ? 
... and it 's just ... well deja vu . 
no ... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before ... 
eventually .   we were going to be   engaged ... when you came back from   overseas ... 
i 'm   fine .   really .   
nothing .   
yes .   hic ! 
no it 's okay .   see when two people belong together the other person should be the ... the key that unlocks the rest of you ... i 'm not making sense am i ? 
actually i was married .   for four years .   but ... well we did n't fit together .   i 'm divorced now . 
oh well ... i guess you ... in high school you were a pretty good first baseman .   and we were on the debate team together .   but ... i think you were gon na run the bijou . you were brought up there and you loved it so much .   and i think you knew how much the town needed a place like that . 
you ... do n't remember but yes ever since i was a little girl . 
and why not ? 
after they commissioned it no one could ever agree on where to put it .   the methodists wanted it in front of the methodist church the presbyterians wanted it in front of the presbyterian church the city council wanted it in the lobby of city hall .   everyone finally got tired of the fighting .   so they stuck it down here . 
through the door .   it comes apart . 
of course there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here . 
be a gentleman .   you have to help me down . 
you first . 
you must not remember anything . come on . 
then why do i feel like we 're still being shadowed ? 
you can all go home now .   he 's not going anywhere . 
yeah a little .   i think you grew an inch or so .   and you 've lost weight . 
you look ... different . 
no i ... i just wondering where you 've been all this time . 
do you ... remember me ? 
ohhh . oh the poor thing . he probably lost his way in the dark . 
is anyone there ? 
then go . 
never mind lydia . do you want to go ? 
that 's up to you . 
i 'll be going too to help out . it should be fun melanie . 
i wanted to be near mitch .   it was over and i knew it but i wanted to be near him anyway .   you see i still like him a hell of a lot . that 's rare i think . i do n't want to lose his friendship ... ever . 
then you know . little girls in brown beanies . deadly . here i have a life . i 'll go into that classroom on monday morning and i 'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces and each of them will be saying ' yes please give me what you have . '   and i 'll give them what i have . i have n't got very much but i 'll give them every ounce of it . to me that 's very important . it makes me want to stay alive for a long long time .   that 's the first reason . 
no that 's all right i do n't mind . i came up here for two reasons . to begin with i was bored with my job in san francisco . i was teaching at a private school there ... well you know you probably went to one yourself . 
you get straight to the point do n't you ? 
so it ended . not immediately of course . i went back to san francisco and i still saw mitch every now and then ... but we both knew it was finished . 
i can understand his position . he went through a lot with lydia after his father died . he did n't want to risk going through it all over again . 
she already has a daughter . 
no i do n't think so . she 's not afraid of losing her son you see .   she 's only afraid of being abandoned . 
afraid of any woman who 'd give mitch the only thing lydia can give him -- love . 
afraid i 'd give mitch . 
because she was afraid . 
lydia liked me you see . that was the strange part of it . in fact now that i 'm no longer a threat we 're very good friends . 
nothing ! i simply existed . so what was the answer ? a jealous woman right ? a clinging possessive mother .   wrong . with all due respect to oedipus i do n't think that was the case at all . 
when i got back to san francisco i spent days trying to figure out just what i 'd done to displease her . 
then maybe it is n't different at all . you know her attitude nearly drove me crazy . i simply could n't understand it . 
with lydia .   did she seem a trifle distant ? 
four years ago . of course that was shortly after his father died .   things may be different now . 
i think i 'll have some of that too .   i was seeing quite a lot of him in san francisco you know .   and then one weekend he asked me up to meet lydia . 
is n't there ?   maybe there is n't . maybe there 's never anything between mitch and any girl . 
you need n't worry . it 's over and done with . a long time ago . 
i guess you knew that anyway . 
oh someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago . 
san francisco . 
well i do n't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor . unless you 're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside . it takes a while to get used to . 
how do you like our little hamlet ? 
or would you rather i changed the subject ? 
it gets a little chilly here at night sometimes . especially if you 're over near the bay . 
all right . 
i 'll get it sit down miss daniels . do you want a sweater or something ? a quilt ? 
would you like some brandy ? 
hi .   is something wrong ? is that cut beginning to bother you ? 
miss daniels ? is that you ? 
yes i know . did something unexpected crop up ? 
it 's utilitarian i 'll say that for it . 
sure . you can have it .   where 's your bag ? in the car ? 
well i 'd really hope to rent it for ... 
oh hi !   did you find her all right ? 
mmm .   well good luck miss daniels . 
do i ?   no i 'm an open book i 'm afraid .   or maybe a closed one .   pretty . what are they ? 
i guess that 's where everyone meets him . 
it 's a nice drive .   is that where you met mitch ? 
did you drive up from san francisco ? 
actually it 's none of my business . 
you 're leaving after you see cathy ? 
thank you . it gives me something to do with my spare time .   there 's a lot of spare time in bodega bay .   did you plan on staying long ? 
i 've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes but i could n't convince myself to stop . this ' tilling of the soil ' can get a little compulsive you know . 
are you a friend of mitch 's ? 
which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place .   did you want to see cathy about something ? 
that 's the one . cathy brenner . 
it 's really up to lydia is n't it ? 
do you think i should go ? 
it seems so pointless .   i think i 'll go to sleep . this has been a busy day .   my luggage . 
he wants me to go to cathy 's party tomorrow afternoon .   i said i would . 
and the second ? 
i did . 
i 'm sorry . forgive me . 
then what are you doing here in bodega bay ? 
i see . 
what about mitch ? did n't he have anything to say about this ? 
someone ought to tell her she 'd be gaining a daughter . 
annie that adds up to a jealous possessive woman . 
i do n't understand . 
afraid you 'd take mitch ? 
then why did she object to you ? 
then what was it ? 
and what had you done ? 
a trifle . 
when was this ? 
what do you mean ? 
annie -- there 's nothing between mitch and me . 
i suspected as much . 
how 'd you happen to come here ? 
where are you from originally annie ? 
i despise it . 
i think so . 
thank you . 
no thank you .   wo n't you call me melanie ? 
if you have some i 'd ... 
no it 's not the cut that 's bothering me . 
i just picked up some things for the night at the general store . you see i had n't planned on spending much time here . 
i would appreciate it . i 've tried everywhere in town and they 're all full . 
that sign .   do you think i could have the room for a single night ? 
i was wondering ... 
yes i did . 
thank you . 
well ... something like that .   i 'm sorry . i do n't mean to sound so mysterious . 
no . just a few hours . 
it 's a lovely garden . 
no not really . 
they seemed sure it was either alice or lois . 
the one who lives in the white house across the bay ? 
the man at the post office sent me . he said you 'd know the name of the little brenner girl . 
i 'm melanie daniels . i 'm sorry to bother you but ... 
miss hayworth ? 
i guess it does get a little hectic at times . 
i do n't know yet . 
darling of course i do ! 
i do n't think so .   i have to get back to san francisco . 
i know . 
i do n't think your mother would like that . 
oh i suppose so . 
your brother told me . 
well i suppose ... 
how much for the phone calls ? 
can i have the boat in about twenty minutes ? 
thank you . 
i need her exact name you see . 
are you sure ? 
the little girl 's name . 
i wonder if you could tell me ... 
thank you . 
of course . 
where would i get a boat ? 
it 's a surprise you see . 
i did n't want to come right down the road where they could see me . 
you see i wanted to surprise them . 
the front door .   is n't there a back road i can take ? 
i see . how do i get down there ? 
the two kids ? 
the brenners ? mr. and mrs. brenner ? 
that 's where the brenners live . 
yes but where ? 
where does he live ? 
do you know him ? 
i 'm looking for a man named mitchell brenner . 
i wonder if you could help me . 
good morning . 
please do n't mess me up with bandages mrs. brenner . 
and locked it . 
that 's the last of it . 
i 'll just clear up here and then dress . 
i do n't mind really . 
would you like me to go for her ? 
why do n't you try to sleep now mrs. brenner . 
i think it might also matter to mitch . 
and if you do n't ? 
is that so important mrs. brenner ? you liking me ? 
why mrs. brenner ? 
would you like to rest now mrs. brenner . 
annie 's there . she 'll be all right . 
try not to think of that mrs. brenner . 
yes i 'm sure she 's fine . 
he must have . he sent for the santa rosa police . 
he was calling from the farm mrs. brenner . 
al malone wanted him out at the fawcett farm . 
no it 's me mrs. brenner . i thought you might like some tea . 
if i go across to santa rosa i 'll come onto the freeway much earlier . 
no not exactly . 
yes . yes someone 's got to feed them . 
sixty ...   oh . 
bodega bay ? where 's that ? 
well where did he go ? 
well i ... 
that 's all right . 
can we turn back ? 
mitch if they hear the car starting ... if they see movement ... 
no ... wait .   hold me . 
i do n't want to be safe . i want to be with you . 
you must be exhausted . 
what time is it ? 
when will they stop ? 
santa rosa ? 
where are they heading ? 
yes .   i 'm tired mitch . i 'm so very very tired . 
i tried a little while ago . the phone 's dead . 
even the birds sitting out there . it does look very much the same mitch . this could be last week . 
i keep thinking of annie . 
how long have they been gathering there ? 
the town looks clear . 
do n't let 's take any chances . 
at annie 's house . she 's all right . 
yes . i was just taking her in some tea . 
... everything i know . 
i 'm frightened and confused and i ... i think i want to go back to san francisco where there are buildings and ... and concrete and ... 
i 'm frightened mitch . 
it makes you feel as if they 're ... they 're waiting or ... resting ... or .... 
after the gulls attacked . 
it was like that yesterday . 
with my little sparrow leading team . 
you have nothing to lose but your feathers . 
and all the while that sparrow was getting in his little messages . birds of the world unite ! 
why should we submit ourselves to their domination ? 
not at first . oh yes a few sparrows out for kicks ... 
yes of course he had to have a beard ! ' birds of the world unite ! ' he kept saying over and over ... 
it all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills a malcontent . he went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings were n't fit to rule this planet preaching wherever anyone would listen ... 
certainly of birds . 
it 's an uprising . 
it 's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday is n't it ? it 's so beautiful and still now .   i think i 've got it all figured out by the way . 
i think i should do n't you ? 
i 'll take cathy up to bed . 
i 'll get it . 
no thank you . 
no i have my things in the car . 
a gull smashed into annie 's front door .   mitch ... what 's happening ? 
i ... i am .   mitch is ... mitch this is n't usual is it ? the gull yesterday when i was in the boat and the one last night at annie 's and now ... 
you 'll think me very bold sir . 
i have an aunt you see . aunt tessa . she 's seventy years old and veddy prim and strait - laced .   she 's coming back from europe at the end of the month and i 'm going to give her a myna bird that 'll talk to her . 
do you know what i was doing in that shop ? 
nothing .   i go to bird shops on fridays . 
on thursdays i have my meeting and lunch .   i 'm chairman of a group that 's sending a little korean boy through school . we plan how to raise funds and ... things like that . 
and on tuesdays i take a course in general semantics at berkeley .   that 's not a job of course . i just take it because ... 
on mondays and wednesdays i work for the travelers ' aid . at the airport . 
i do different things on different days . 
i have several jobs . 
well ... i have to get to work tomorrow morning for one thing . 
what 's in this ? nitro - glycerin ? 
i could n't possibly . i have to get back . 
i really should n't have any more . i 'm a little tipsy already . 
i thought you knew ! i want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked ! good night ! 
but not for me . 
that might have been good enough in rome last summer . but it 's not good enough now . 
i do n't give a damn what you believe ! 
i told you what happened in rome ! 
because it seemed stupid and foolish . 
i wrote the letter . 
yes i was lying . 
no .   at least i did n't until i came up here . 
yes that 's the truth . but i was pushed into that fountain and that 's the truth too . 
yes but ... 
i 'm neither poor nor innocent but the truth of that particular ... 
with all my clothes on !   the newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father 's paper .   anything they said ... 
without any clothes on ? 
in case you 're interested i was pushed into that fountain . 
oh . that . rome . 
how does mother know what i like to do ? 
san francisco 's a long way from here . 
will i be seeing you again ? 
oh yes . 
why did he shoot her ? 
i 'm sure . 
annie ... annie may have made other plans . i 'll have to see . besides i can find my own way . 
with ... with annie of course . 
certainly but ... 
yes but ... 
i 'm sorry . i could n't possibly ... 
look mr. brenner ... 
i was ! and all i get for my pains is a ... a ... a hole in the head ! 
i ca n't say i like your seagulls much either . i come all the way up here to ... 
none of your business .   am i still bleeding ? 
i loathe you . you have no manners . and you 're arrogant and conceited and ... i wrote you a letter about it in fact but i tore it up . 
it was no trouble at all . i simply called my father 's paper . besides i was coming up here anyway i already told you ... 
why would i want to see you of all people ? 
oh no you do n't ! 
just a few ... just a day or two ... the weekend . 
we ... we went to school together . college . 
annie . annie hayworth . 
to see a friend of mine .   will you please be careful ? 
to bring your sister those birds . you said it was her birthday . besides i was coming up anyway . 
did n't you see the lovebirds ? 
only violators and practical jokers . 
is that why you 'd like to see everyone behind bars ? 
what kind of law ? 
do you practice here ? 
so you 're a lawyer . 
what 's that ? 
what made it ... 
and i 'm glad you did n't get your lovebirds ! 
i think you 're a louse . 
you knew i did n't work here . you deliberately ... 
what do you call your lovebird story if not a practical ... 
what are you ? a policeman ? 
i did n't break that window ! 
we never met in court or anyplace else . 
i do n't know you . 
hey wait a minute ! 
but how ... how do you know my name ? 
what did you say ? 
are you sure you would n't like to see a canary instead ? we have some very nice canaries this week . 
well ... they get a sort of hangdog expression . 
some of them are . 
yes that 's a particularly dangerous time . 
oh certainly . it 's to protect the species . 
well we ca n't just let them fly around the shop you know . 
does n't what make me ... ? 
yes we call them that too .   ahhh here we are lovebirds ... 
no sir those are ... redbirds .

well this one wo n't be a chick will he ? 
you said three o'clock . 
what do you suppose it is ? 
hello mrs. macgruder have you ever seen so many gulls ? 
maybe ! is it impossible ? 
i do n't know anything about birds except that they 're attacking this town . 
maybe they 're all protecting the species . maybe they 're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and ... 
have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest ? 
no one called it a war ! 
i do n't know why . 
to ...   to kill them . 
daniels . i think they were after the children . 
what were the crows after at the school ?

yes i did . 
in a democracy cathy everyone is entitled to a fair trial . your brother 's practice ... 
no cathy . he sold mr. fawcett a different brand .   you do n't think they 're getting sick do you mitch ? 
he got a call from dan fawcett a little while ago . his chickens wo n't eat either . 
i started to say ... inside ... 
i 'm frightened terribly frightened . i ... i do n't know what 's out there mitch . 
if they are ? 
if ...   if ... when we get to san francisco ...   if they 're already there ? 
we 'd never make it . they 're probably all over the road . 
where can we go mitch ? there 's no place to go . 
but they 'll be back . 
i mean . i want to ... 
i 'm not very good at this mitch . 
i know you can .   but i 'd like to . 
oh my god look at her ! 
i 'm sorry mitch . 
you do n't know you do n't know ! when will you know ? when we 're all dead ? like annie ? 
what happens when we run out of wood ? 
where will we go ? 
maybe we ought to leave . 
if there are ... larger birds mitch ... they 'll get into the house . 
when do you think they 'll come ? 
did you you get the windows in the attic mitch ? 
tell him about the party . 
well ... well is everyone all right ? 
well ...   so long as you know what you want mitch . 
it 's none of my business of course but when you bring a girl like that to ... 
perhaps i 'm old - fashioned .   i know it was supposed to be very warm there mitch but ... well ... actually ... well the newspaper said she was naked . 
she is the one who jumped into that fountain in rome last summer is n't she ? 
you 'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print . she 's always mentioned in the columns mitch . 
forgive me . i suppose i 'm just naturally curious about a girl like that .   she 's very rich is n't she ? 
but she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way ... 
she was selling birds . 
in a bird shop . 
how long have you known her ? 
and certainly pretty . 
she 's a charming girl is n't she mitch ? 
never mind the law . cathy you can start serving the soup . 
whose side are you on ? 
he sold the feed to me did n't he ? 
there 's nothing wrong with those chickens mitch . i 'm going to call fred brinkmeyer right now . 
seven o'clock same as usual . 
lovebirds i see . 
you did say birds ? 
across at brinkmeyer 's . 
oh . i see . 
how do you do miss daniels ?   acknowledge a what ? 
a what ? 
i thought i saw your car . what are you doing in town ? 
shhhh . shhhh . 
did you close the door ? 
would you ? i 'd feel so much better . 
i could n't ask you to . 
i wish i were stronger .   do you think she 's all right ? do you think she 's safe at the school ? 
mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do .   i 'm not complaining . that 's the mark of a man .   but ...   you see i ... i would n't want to be ... be left alone . i do n't think i could bear being left alone .   i ... forgive me . this business with the birds has me upset .   i ... i do n't know what i 'd do if mitch were n't here . 
then i do n't suppose it 'll matter much to anyone but me . 
yes i think so . my son is important to me . i want to like any girl he chooses . 
because my son is ...   my son seems to be fond of you .   and i ...   i 'm not quite sure how i feel about it . i really do n't know if i ... like you or not . 
no .   no ... do n't go yet .   i feel as if i ... i do n't understand you . and i want so much to understand . 
i miss him .   you know sometimes i wake up in the morning and i think ' i have to make frank 's breakfast ' and i ... i get up and there 's a ... a very good reason for getting out of bed until ... until of course i remember .   i miss talking to him .   cathy 's a child you know and mitch ...   ... mitch has his own life .   i 'm glad he stayed here today . i feel safer with him here . 
i wish i could be that way . 
i 'm not this way you know . not usually . i do n't fuss and fret over my children .   when frank died ...   you see he knew the children he really knew them . he had the knack of being able to enter into their world of becoming a part of them . that 's a rare talent . 
i lost my husband four years ago you know .   it 's odd how you depend on someone for strength and then suddenly all the strength is gone and you 're alone .   i 'd love to relax some time . i 'd love to be able to sleep .   do you think cathy 's all right ? 
i wish i were a stronger person . there is a long awkward silence . she sips at her tea reflectively . 
i keep seeing dan fawcett 's face .   they have such big windows at the school .   all the windows were broken . in dan 's bedroom . all the windows . 
do i sound foolish to you ? 
cathy . at the school . 
do you think cathy 's all right ? 
what good will they do ? 
then he saw . 
why ? did n't al believe my story ? 
where 's mitch ? 
oh thank you . 
yeah and the freeway 's well - lighted is n't it mitch ? 
then you knew mitch in san francisco is that right ? 
it 's alice . 
it 's alice ai n't it ? 
the little brenner girl . 
it 's nothing . 
yep .   could save yourself a lot of trouble . her name 's alice for sure . 
near the top of the hill you 'll see the school and right behind it the church . you head for the school . now just past the school you 'll see a little house with a red mail box . that 's where annie hayworth lives she 's the school teacher . you ask her about the little brenner girl . 
that case i tell you what you do . you go straight through town ' til you see a little hotel on your left there . not the motel that 's the other end of town . this is the hotel . now you take a right turn there you got that ? 
well i ai n't positive if that 's what you mean . 
alice i think .   harry what 's the little brenner girl 's name ? 
the little brenner girl ? 
what name ? 
d'you want me to order one for you ? 
down at the dock by the tides restaurant . ever handled an outboard boat ? 
mmmmmm .   ' course you could get yourself a boat cut right across the bay with it . the brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at . if that 's what you wanted to do . 
nope . that 's the road . straight through town stay on your left right around the bay to the front door . 
follow the road straight through town ' til it curves off on the left . that 'll take you right around the bay to their front door . 
yep . mitch and the little girl . 
nope just lydia and the two kids . 
and the white house ? 
see them two big trees across there ? 
see where i 'm pointing ? 
right across the bay there . 
right here . bodega bay . 
try my best . 
i might be able to have them by tomorrow morning . would that be all right ? 
well ... well how soon would you want them ? 
no not in the shop . but i can order them for you . 
yes certainly . 
they said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon . if you 'd care to come back ... 
what ? oh yes certainly . 
i have no idea . 
oh good ! oh wonderful . 
i 'm sure they 're on the way though . could i just call ? 
oh . oh well all right . 
yes .   oh my i suppose i should call them again . they said three o'clock .   maybe it 's the traffic . i 'll call . would you mind waiting ? 
well yes he 'll talk . well no no . you 'll have to teach him to talk . 
certainly not . oh no . certainly not . this will be a full grown myna bird . full grown . 
i know . oh i know .   i 've been calling all morning . oh you have no idea . miss daniels they 're so difficult to get really they are . we get them from india you know when they 're just little chicks and then we have to ... 
i was hoping you 'd be a little late miss daniels .   you see he has n't arrived yet . 
hello miss daniels . 
and back with macfarlane and all that he stands for the next day . 
there 's no standing between a fool and his folly . if you must babble your news to him he 's at the fisherman 's tryst . it 's the inn at pennycuik . you can use macfarlane 's horse and gig to get there . he 'll welcome the ride back . 
you do n't went to find him . your news will keep until i tell him . 
he 's not home . 
it 's a gift to my people -- and i see macfarlane and gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and i would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.-- 
listen to me fettes i 'm one part befuddled with drink one part over - heels in love with macfarlane and one part fey . you 're a lowlander fettes and you have no way of knowing what we highlanders call the second sight . 
that porter was gray and the gentleman of consequence who could n't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire gray -- 
they did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the kings counselor pressed him hard -- how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence . 
and did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against burke ? 
gray has no need to threaten . you remember the trial ? 
if he were only that . the man 's evil himself . some day you 'll know him as macfarlane knows him -- for macfarlane he was to knox as you are to him . that brought him close to gray he roistered with him and drank with him . aye and gray even brought him to my door and my love . there is all that between them and more -- burke and hare and knox -- 
i 'm cold as ice . 
he could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always gray -- gray to hound him to his death . 
is it a great man whom gray can order to his bidding ? is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that i must play maidservant for the world 's sake and his success ? 
save yourself . master fettes look at macfarlane and be warned . 
you must leave this house . 
you 've been with gray again . 
you 're not going to gray . 
i 'll get him . 
crony indeed ! 
no great lady will ever take my place ? 
you may deny the devil toddy but you 'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead . 
aye .   he 's a good lad .   that 's why i ask you macfarlane . 
in the woods you said you had nothing . but you would n't and i would n't if there 's some way you do n't have to go . please . at least not right away . 
no matter what happens ... you 're innocent ... i promise ... 
i do n't know . i found him lying there . 
it 's not . i ca n't take it . 
i wish i could hate him but i ca n't . he said he 'd never hurt either of us and i know it 's true and ... i 'm going back . 
i used to be so proud of him . my big deal daddy . and now he 's just a crook . worse even . and the weird thing is ... 
my father . 
so you 're going to kill him ? 
i do n't want to see ! 
yes i do i really do . 
it 's all my fault . oh god . i wish i were dead . 
... is that i sent them here . i told them she came here sometimes . with her dirtball boyfriend . that 's exactly what i said . 
when lauren was missing the police came to our house . they said they were looking for her right ?   but i know now they had her and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you ... 
yeah i know . 
no ! why are you haunting me ? 
my dad was right ! he said you 'd ruin her life . 
you killed lauren ! you killed her ! 
i know who you are .   that 's why you paint your face . to hide . 
you killed that cop dutton . 
daisy . how did you know ? 
stay away from me ! dad ! dad ! 
how do you know ? 
you 're a friend of the guy who killed her are n't you ? you almost sound like him . 
and he 's right over there by the way .   what did you do to your face ? 
yeah no kidding . 
i know her friends . 
i 'm never going back in that house again . get away . 
i do n't believe you . 
do n't call me that ! do n't call me anything ! 
about you . 
stay away from me ! stay away ! 
you killed her ! 
you 're in with them . 
i think i dropped an earring . 
he said he 'd prove it . 
that guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about lauren . 
lauren called me that when we were little . daisy . no one knew but us . 
the cop who found the knife in corvis 's car . 
what 's that supposed to mean ? he was right here . he was ! 
this guy said he was a friend of lauren 's . he had like paint all over his face . 
watch out ! 
it 's not that . really . it 's just ... now that he 's gone i think it 's time . 
stay in the car . i 'll only take a second . 
i want to take this to lauren . she 'd want it . 
why are there so many ? 
i do . every day . 
she was eighteen years old ! there were four of them . they stabbed her fifty three times ! where 's the fucking accident ? ! huh ? ! where is it ? ! 
you killed my daughter . 
you mean alex . 
please . come inside . 
i would never hurt you or lauren . never . believe me . 
about them . you 've got to leave it alone . 
they killed her because she found out . 
erin . it was n't supposed to happen . 
it 's not what you think . 
looks like you have them both on . 
it still does n't mean ... 
honey . it 's does n't mean anything . it 's not a message . 
what ? what is it ? 
what is it ? 
are you ok ? 
what were you yelling about ? 
erin . i know you think she 's been talking to you . 
honey . i just ca n't . 
just hold on to me . 
yes dear . come on now .   bobby your shoes are soaking ! 
come on darling -- we 're going up to bed . 
he gave these to you ? 
you did n't really see the space ship . you just thought you did . 
now think back hard . you did n't follow mr. carpenter at all did you ? you have n't even been out of the house . 
bobby you 've been dreaming again . 
now bobby just a minute-- 
tell me what ? 
bobby-- ! what are you doing up at this hour ? 
no dear of course not . he 's a very nice man . i just think he might prefer to be left alone . now you get to bed and forget about it .   ' night darling . 
what do you mean dear ? 
did you and mr. carpenter really go to see professor barnhardt ? 
bobby -- i think it would be better if we did n't see quite so much of mr. carpenter 
go to bed darling . you can finish that in the morning . 
of course dear . 
professor barnhardt . 
i -- i do n't know dear ... perhaps there 's some mistake . 
come on bobby . time to go to bed . 
did you have a nice day dear ? 
hello darling .   good evening mr. carpenter . 
that 's enough bobby . i think it 's time you went to bed . 
i 'm not going to marry anybody . 
i feel different right now . 
tom you must n't -- ! you do n't know what you 're doing ! it is n't just you and mr. carpenter . the rest of the world is involved ! 
is that what you 're thinking about ? 
but he is n't a menace ! he told me what he came here for . 
that 's what i 'm trying to tell you . we must n't do anything about it . believe me tom i know what i 'm talking about . 
you do n't understand . you do n't realize how important it is . 
never mind about that .   you 've got to promise me you wo n't say a word to anybody . 
all right tom -- it 's true . i know it 's true . 
what about him ? 
tom -- i 've been trying to get you all afternoon-- 
i -- i 'm afraid i ca n't -- not right now . can i talk to you later ? . yes that 'll be fine . ' bye . 
i 've got a good lock on my door .   and bobby 's going to sleep in my room tonight . 
bobby and i have had enough excitement for tonight . 
is it real ? 
oh tom that was awful . 
i was talking to mr. carpenter . 
i will be in just a minute . 
you 're a good salesman -- but i 've got to think about it . 
you know how i feel tom . i just want to think it over . 
it was a wonderful day . 
there 's always somebody here but today of course they 've all got plans . 
there 's only one thing -- i have n't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with bobby .   i do n't suppose we could take him with us ? 
i think i 'm very lucky . you do n't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it . 
no . that 's all finished . 
we 'll miss you very much -- bobby and i.   he wo n't have anyone to play with . 
but how -- how long-- ? 
you mean he has the power of life and death ? 
i -- i thought you were-- 
gort ?   but he 's a robot . i mean -- without you what could he do ? 
it 's only a few blocks to barnhardt 's . 
where is the meeting going to be ? 
tom ... he was there last night when bobby told me what he saw . 
no wait a minute -- there 's someone else . 
where are you going now ? 
yes -- just exactly . 
you hold great hope for this meeting . 
why not ? 
we could try pushing the other buttons .   i have a flashlight in my purse . 
just twelve . 
what happened ? 
what is it you want ? 
i -- i did n't really pay much attention--   bobby has such an active imagination . 
i -- i was just going to lunch . 
oh -- hello-- 
mr. carpenter i--   goodnight . 
goodnight mr. carpenter . 
mr. carpenter -- this is none of my business but -- why did that detective come here last night ? 
naturally i think so . 
he has his homework to keep him occupied . 
jittery is the word . 
i do n't know how to thank you . 
i will david ! 
leave him alone . 
c'm on michael .   i want to go . 
for a ride . 
i like michael . 
promise me you 'll keep it that way .   you 're not like the others laddie .   you 're like me .   i can still remember too . 
you did n't tell david ? 
no laddie .   it was a < u > memory</u > . 
laddie ... you can < u > still</u > remember . you can still remember home . 
who laddie ? 
this is michael . 
so do i ! 
they 'll be coming for laddie and me wo n't they ? 
save laddie first . 
take laddie . 
david 's looking for me ... i have to go . 
i 'm weak ... soon i 'll need to feed . 
it 's not too late for you to be saved ... but each night ... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing ... 
because i love you ... 
not yet ... you 're like laddie and me ... half - vampires ... you 're not a full vampire until you 've made your first kill ... you were supposed to be mine ... but i could n't michael . 
yes ... and i 'm to blame for it . if you had n't met me ... if i had n't liked you ... i tried to warn you ... 
i have to talk to you .   can i come up ? 
tonight .   at the boardwalk ... 
have to sleep .   have to sleep michael . 
no ... no everything 's different now ... 
no .   they 've made me one of them but i miss my family . 
i used to fight with my family all the time ... just got fed up and ran away . 
do n't be a baby .   that did n't hurt and you know it . 
i guess you 're new around here . 
michael 's great .   i like michael . 
me too . 
what do you mean ? 
if you want your ear pierced i 'll do it . 
okay .   talk . 
did you want to talk to me ? 
are you following me ? 
' again ' ?   dad ... you have n't had company in this house since mom died eight years ago . 
i told max eight o'clock . 
dad !   do n't sneak up on people like that ! 
i ca n't sleep with the closet door open either .   not even a crack .   your father does n't mind though . it could be wide open for all he cared .   i think one of the reasons i divorced him was because he never believed ... in the horror ... of the < u > closet monster</u > ! 
when i dressed like you do now you threw me out of the house . i used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits ... then i went ahead and married one ... i went yuppie and you became a hippie ... were still out of synch . 
a big legal war was n't going to improve anybody 's situation .   we 've all been through enough .   besides i was raised better than that . thanks for having us dad . 
michael ! ... 
there 's only three weeks left of summer michael .   things are going to change around here when school starts . 
max is coming for dinner michael . i 'd like you to meet him . 
wait a minute kiddo . 
-- if there 's a girl we could talk about her . 
then let 's act like friends . let 's talk .   i know this is a new place and -- 
does that mean we are or we are n't ? 
grandpa has plans of his own .   michael i want you to do this . everybody has been bending over backwards for you .   you come home late .   you sleep in to the middle of the day -- sam is always alone . you do exactly what you want ... tonight do what i want for a change . 
michael will you do me a favor this evening ?   will you stay home with sam tonight ?   i 'm meeting max for dinner after work . 
michael are you still in bed ? 
i get off in another twenty minutes .   i thought maybe we 'd all get a bite together . 
oh no you wo n't . 
bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want ... well ' til eleven thirty maybe . 
he 's just a deep sleeper . 
for everything . 
still mad at me ? 
what happened ?   is everybody all right ? ! 
there 's nothing wrong with max .   i do n't know why you do n't -- 
not another word !   i ca n't believe you 're doing this .   i 'm going to see max tonight and you 're trying to ruin it for me again . 
stop it sam .   stop it right now ! 
not funny sam !

where 's michael ? 
sam !   what happened ! ?   you had me scared to death .   are you all right ? 
what 's wrong ?   tell me . 
sam .   is everything all right ? 
lights out sam . 
i guess no one cares what i got a job . 
you 've heard this story before ? 
not that poor . 
tell them to get something to eat . 
that 's the boardwalk sam . 
guys i know it has n't been easy ... the divorce and now the move ...   but i think you 're really going to like living in santa carla ... 
ocean air ! 
we 're getting close ... 
will somebody please tell me what this is all about ! ? 
max ... what are you talking about ? 
i thought you said they needed discipline ? 
no no .   just worrying about my boys -- as usual . 
i hope so . 
he does n't walk all over me . 
i do n't understand sam .   he 's just not like this . 
i 'm really sorry max . 
max !   what 's wrong ? 
boy !   < u > somebody</u > areound here sure has bad breath ! 
you 're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding . 
i hear this is the decade for cute . 
i guess if i had my choice i 'd like to do something that involves children .   work with kids in some way .   teenagers maybe .   and santa carla seems to be full of them . 
you seem like a terrific guy max and i 'm grateful for the job ... 
ohm i would have been ... one marriage ago . 
you 're cute max . 
hi thorn . 
do i look that needy ? 
i 'm not looking for a tape .   what i need is -- 
let them . 
alex ... people are staring . 
now i know you 're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget . 
heavens look at that now ! 
so it 's astronomy now is it ? 
they are rare ...   ... orion 's belt pointing to the earth -- 
we took a walk three days ago . 
you 're so pale ... i hope you 're not coming down with something . 
alex it 's just the zoo . 
why do we have to race for heaven 's sake ? ! 
alex ... ? ! 
alex what is it ? 
all right ... 
let 's walk through the park ... 
all right ... 
alex what is it ? 
trust me ... 
dance with me ... 
you 're late . 
a moonstone . 
you know the moment is rather dying here . 
and what do you propose professor ? shall we hold a seminar to study the problem ? 
you 're getting warmer . 
admiration ?   my my . 
all right what is it now ? 
... orion 's belt pointing to the earth .   you see it over the rocks there ?   sailors consider that an omen of good fortune ; the hunter watching over them on their travels ... are you listening to me alex ? 
talk away professor . 
well there 's something new . 
you promised me flowers tonight do n't you even remember ? 
you promised me flowers . 
trust me ... 
dance with me ... 
you 're late . 
it was different then . 
kalen -- we have to get kalen -- ! 
please i beg you .   take him away from here -- 
alexander take my son away .   take him back to your time .   will you do that ? 
go back to your own time ? 
so you can use it now ? 
it 's undamaged ? 
i know what it is to lose someone . when my husband was taken from us ... i thought the pain would never end . 
is it ? 
someone you loved very much . 
you lost someone . 
you know this ? 
alexander ... ? 
it sounds like a wonderful place to live . 
it must have been safe . 
did you have fires at night ? 
learning was important ? 
you liked it there . 
i try to imagine how they 'll look when they 're done .   i try to imagine how we 'll fit in with them ... our place in the world . 
i 'm a planner .   i help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like . 
and there 's no shame to that .   it 's all the same here .   everyone has an important job to do .   we all work together and could n't survive without each other . 
it 's always been this way here .   we work on the towers all our lives . when we 're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors ... 
it has no purpose .   it 's just beautiful ... does everything have a purpose where you come from ? 
i do n't understand . 
it 's not supposed to be easy it 's supposed to be beautiful . 
want to be a high climber now do you ? 
the mud carriers . 
thank you . 
we share everything . 
every night . 
we all have that dream . 
and you saw a shape ahead of you ... 
then you came to a desert and mountains ... 
good night then . 
do n't then have stars where you come from ? 
you seem fascinated by the stars . 
i 'll take you to your machine tomorrow . 
i 'm going to sit with kalen .   keep the fire burning if you can . 
just a dream .   you should sleep too .   you 're still not well . 
i 'll take you tomorrow ... you must have seen a lot on your journey . 
i might find the truth rather hard to understand ? ... can you go back ? 
why would you do that ? 
how long ago ? 
that machine -- 
oh that explains everything . 
then you can speak slowly . 
we do n't have anything like this . or the machine where kalen found you .   and i doubt they do beyond the valley ... now where do you come from ? 
you 're not from beyond the valley . 
he 's gone to a better place . 
kalen will tire you out if you let him .   he 's always been curious . his father was firm with him but ... it 's just his way . 
is there a lot of illness ? 
how long did you travel ? 
you 're up !   you must be feeling better -- 
kalen look at me .   there 's no one here but us .   you see ... i 'm here you 're here alexander 's here . there are no morlocks .   it was just a dream ... 
no you 're safe -- 
kalen it 's all right i 'm here -- 
kalen right now you need to go up to bed .   you 're exhausting alexander . 
we 'll see about that . 
what 's it like where you come from ? 
that 's quite enough kalen . 
where ? [ beat ] it 's becker is n't it ? he 's doing stuff is n't he ? 
what should they be looking for ? 
it 's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about . 
i wish they 'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget . our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we do n't have . 
i see you 've done your homework . [ beat ] alpine grove 's undergone a lot of changes since then . at the time we did n't have the ... resources to help our patients the way we needed to . [ beat ] now we do . and things are different . 
i still do n't either even after all these years . 
he just said ... that i 'd shock eugene and then things would change for him . 
it 's complicated but [ looking at starks ] in a way your father let me know how i 'd get through to him . 
sure . it 's an easy address . a little far out there but easy enough . 
what are you talking about ? 
who told you this ? 
william i ca n't indulge these delusions even when you 're in this state . 
i do believe you ... 
i 'm not gon na let that happen . 
what for ? 
you 're going to be ok william . we just need to get your fever down and we 'll be able to hopefully stabilize you . 
you have nothing to fear william . 
you told me this was how it happened . 
i know . i know it all . save your strength . i already know everything you 're going to say . [ beat ] you 're in the jacket right now are n't you ? 
i do n't know how you know about eugene but these ideas are part of your delusions . 
how do you know about eugene ? 
william that is just another facet of my delusions . 
and how do you know that ? 
why not ? 
why do n't you help me ? 
[ beat ] like who ? like mackenzie maybe ? 
what about the world ? 
the future does n't look different ? 
ok fine . tell me about it . tell me about the future . 2004 . what does it look like ? 
well what time is it ? 
then help me understand . you know you 're not alone . a lot of gulf vets have begun to experience curious symptoms . what you have might well be a syndrome and if so it 's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously . 
no i do . that 's what i 'm saying to you . 
what do you mean ? 
you 'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition . 
well ... [ beat ] let me know how your search turns out . 
it 's important for you to know who your father was is n't it ? 
so maybe dr. becker would know . [ beat ] but as i 'm sure you know the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities . 
how do you know about dr. becker ? 
i was . but i saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows . i 'm sorry i do n't know more about your father 's . [ sincerely ] i did n't know about everything that went on here . 
i was working with a boy named eugene . 
at the end he made me change my mind about a lot of things . 
yeah i did . [ beat ] he was my most memorable patient . 
my god you look exactly like him . 
you should be careful . you could be killed if they found you out here . 
so it 's helping ? 
you may never remember at all . [ beat ] your mind 's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged . 
you were convicted of the crime . 
you 're not crazy . 
i guess i 'd ask you why . 
mom this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway . the guy you yelled at for no good reason ... 
mom he just fixed our car . 
how you doin' ? 
it 's ok . it 's ok . relax . it 's just a cut . we can get it fixed . but we need to get you to the hospital now . how 'd you get that ? 
you 're bleeding pretty bad there . 
ok i guess . 
i 've been ok . 
then where are you going ? 
112 orchard way . [ realizing in a whisper ] you 're not coming back are you ? 
ok . ssh . rest . 
because your body can only take so much of what they 're putting you through . 
to the hospital . 
why are you saying that ? [ beat ] we do n't have long do we ? 
what ? how can you say that ? he 's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval ... jacket . he 's probably the one who killed you . 
that 's all you got from him ? that bastard helped take your life away from you . 
william you 're not making sense . 
it 's sunday . 
[ beat ] i do n't know . 
i do n't know . but this is n't a dream . i 'm real and so is where we are . 
what ? what are you thinking ? 
[ beat lost ] no . 
they 're not here . 
yeah . i called the number yesterday to make sure . thomas becker retired m.d. 
here drink this . i 'll get the heat going . 
it 's not a prison it 's a hospital . there 's got to be some way out of there and you 've got to find it ... 
you 've got to get yourself out of that place . they 're going to kill you if you do n't . 
what about captain medley ? he never told them what happened to you over there . his testimony ... that coward wanted them to think you were crazy . 
they told me becker 's in shelbourne now . i looked him up and he was listed . 
how long do we have ? 
because that 's the part i believe is true . you probably did help her somehow with the boy and eugene 's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts i pulled . 
let 's see if they have an address for becker . i also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with . 
you think lorenson kills you ? 
me neither . who was the boy she was talking about eugene ? 
no . they never figured it out . i did . most murderers do n't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road . not without hurting them . 
i know . 
alpine grove still exists . i looked it up on the net . we should go there and see if there 's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you . 
then we need to figure out what happened to you . it 's the only thing we can do . 
[ softly ] i want to trust you . should i trust you ? 
i do n't know . [ beat ] i thought i was crazy after you left that day . i died . i still think i could be crazy . but then i replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it i could remember -- and it was like ... i do n't care if i was or am . i have n't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life . [ beat ] and when you left all i wanted was ... 
i do n't know how you got the cut to your head but you died bleeding from it . 
[ beat ] you bled to death . 
but no one knew until after ... 
it was banned you know ... and it led to an investigation of dr. becker 's mistreatment of some of his patients . that 's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients ... 
the jacket . that 's what they call it right ? 
i 'm telling you i do n't care what time you think you 're in . you 're not william starks . [ beat ] i do n't believe in many things but i believe in death . and it does n't give back what it takes . so whoever you are ... i did a nice thing you 've made me regret it enough already so please just leave . 
no it 's not . [ beat ] it 's december 25th 2004 . 
i know what this is ... i picked you up when i was drunk and you probably thought i 'm just fucked up enough to fall for this . but the thing is i know what i 'm doing when i drink . i just usually do n't care . right now i do though . and i want you out . now . 
i do n't know . but he did die . starks falters under the news . jackie looks around through her now blurred eyes like she might find some help in the apartment . she settles for the bottle of vodka on the table lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink then laughs nervously as she looks up . 
no you did n't . they found william starks ' body dead in the snow . 
i looked it up . 
his body was found new year 's day 19 ... 1993 . at alpine ... 
william starks is dead ... [ beat ] i 've been to his grave . 
you ca n't be william starks . he 's dead . 
stop it ! stop it ! jackie covers her ears and looks at him pleading with her eyes . starks ' eyes plead right back . 
well you belong in one . 
what ? now you 're gon na show me some kind of driver 's license ? 
if you do n't get out of my house right now i 'll call the police . 
what 'd you do ? snoop all over the place ? you had no right . you had no right to go through anything . 
william starks . [ beat ] thanks . 
what for ? 
what 're those ? 
you 're just gon na walk ? 
but i like it i guess . 
yeah but i do n't know what . 
our car wo n't start . 
come on mom . do n't fall asleep ... 
because becker resigned after the charges brought against him by state patient advocacy groups . 
i do n't understand . 
just a little when we were looking up information about william 's father . how did he help ? 
yeah me too . [ softly ] every day for the last ten years . 
she fucked herself up day after day and then one day she fell asleep with a burning cigarette . [ beat ] i came home from work and she was gone . 
never knew my father . i grew up with my mother . actually i grew up around my mother . she was great though . i mean the way she was with her friends ... she was this woman who had so much life in her she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us . [ beat ] she died young . 
i 'm sorry . 
so you never knew your mother ? 
may be easy to remember but not easy to get . being warm maybe -- but look you do n't even have a coat and i still have to chop wood to make a fire . [ beat ] and being happy ... you tell me if that 's simple . 
you remember it ? 
maybe . [ beat ] maybe not . 
[ beat ] real is overrated . 
well good for you . 
shit happens and your life changes . ' bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen . [ beat ] so how come you do n't know where you 're coming from ? 
[ beat ] i do it . 
yup . that 's me . 
this is pretty good . considering ... 
you want a drink ? 
no it 's fine . [ beat swallow ] thanks . 
what 's this ? 
you know what ? it 's christmas eve . and you look clean -- i mean you 're normal - looking . [ resolutely for her own benefit ] it 's christmas eve and i have a couch . 
no you wo n't . you 'll die of cold out there and then i 'll have to feel guilty . and i 've already got more guilt than i know what to do with . [ beat ] do you want something to drink ? 
where are you going ? you 'll freeze out there . you do n't even have a coat . 
great . that was our last option . what am i going to do with you ? 
well do n't you somewhere ? stuff ? belongings ? 
do you have a motel or something ? money ? 
well how 'd you get here ? 
because in my life it would n't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he 's from and a place where he 's going to . it 'd be too simple . i probably would n't know how to handle a situation like that . 
of course you do n't know . 
well where are you from ? 
you do n't have anywhere to stay ? 
let me ask you that again . this time look around and consider your options . 
all right . [ beat ] you got somewhere you need to go mister ? 
in case you had n't figured it 's christmas eve . you 're never gon na get a cab here . 
if you 're deaf read my lips ... i do n't need a psycho following me today . 
go fuck yourself . 
... only for one day and we 'll be back tomorrow night . 
' bye honey .   i wo n't wait up . 
funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a friday night .   you 'd almost think they 's want to forget about it for the weekend . 
you want anything special for dinner ? 
have a good day at work today . 
i 'm sorry doll i just did n't want you to be late .

it 's okay .   he is an asshole .   most of the time i just let it slide . 
twenty - four is n't young .   i 'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married .   i 've never been with anybody but darryl . 
darryl that 's my husband he says he 's not ready .   he 's still too much of a kid himself .   he prides himself on being infantile . 
so j.d. what are you studying in school ? 
a regular outlaw . 
do n't mind me jimmy i 'm just a wild woman . 
good answer .   same goes double for me . 
jimmy !   hello stranger .   what in the world are you doin' here ? 
you 're a good friend .

is n't it beautiful ? ! ! 
what in the hell is it ? ! 
way up ahead ! 
what in the hell is that up there ? 
i guess everything we 've got to lose is already gone anyway . 
i guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty . 
i guess i went a little crazy huh ? 
you 're a good friend . 
louise ... no matter what happens i 'm glad i came with you . 
i know this whole thing was my fault .   i know it is . 
what ? ! 
did you see that guy ? !   he was right in the middle of the road ! 
how long do you think that 'll take ? 
how far are we from mexico ? 
i guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught . 
hey .   where 'd you learn to shoot like that ? 
does that mean suck my dick ? 
i mean really !   that business with your tongue .   what is that ?   that 's disgusting !

it 'd have to be pretty good . 
i wanna get a job .   i wanna work at club med .

louise do you think we should change cars get another car ? 
gosh did n't he say anything positive at all ? 
but i do n't know ... something 's crossed over in me and i ca n't go back .   i mean i just could n't live ... 
i can understand if you 're thinkin ' about it .   i mean in a way you 've got something to go back for .   i mean jimmy and everything . 
you 're not gon na make some deal with that guy are you ?   i mean i just wanna know . 
you 're not gon na give up on me are ya ? 
no louise you said the first part . i said all the rest . 
that guy was hurtin ' me .   and if you had n't come out when you did he 'd a hurt me a lot worse .   and probably nothin' woulda happened to him . 'cause everybody did see me dancin ' with him all night .   and they woulda made out like i asked for it .   and my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now .   at least now i 'm havin' fun .   and i 'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead . i 'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me .   and if i have n't i wanna take this time to thank you louise .   thank you for savin ' my ass . 
nobody would believe us .   we 'd still get in trouble .   we 'd still have our lives ruined .   and you know what else ? 
you know why .   you already said . 
are you alright ? 
yeah you want it ? 
okay okay ... i 've got some tequila . you want some tequila ?

we should have just ignored him . 
just ignore him . 
i always wanted to travel .   i just never got the opportunity . 
this is so beautiful . 
always lookin ' on the bright side are n't ya ? 
i mean look how different he looks just since high school .   it 's bad enough i have to get old but doin' it with darryl around is only gon na make it worse .   i mean i do n't think he 's gon na be very nice about it . 
well to be honest the idea of getting old with darryl was kinda startin ' to get to me . 
oh yeah .   you mean peek - a - poos . 
like a chihuahua ? 
what little dogs ? 
of all the things in the world that scare you what 's the worst thing that scares you the most ? 
can i ask you kind of a weird question ? 
i 'm not suggestin ' that !   i 'm not goin' back .   no matter what happens . so do n't worry about me . 
whaddo we do ? 
now what ? 
i always wanted to see new mexico . 
louise ?   where are we ? 
you 're right . 
i just told him if he ever gets to mexico to look us up .   i asked him not to tell .   i did n't think he would tell anybody . 
i ... i ... 
let 's get it over with . 
alright louise ! 
why not ? ! 
they do n't know that !   it was just you and me there .   i 'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him !   i mean it 's almost the truth ! 
murder one !   god louise ca n't we even say it was self - defense ? 
jeez louise tapped the phone ?   you think so ? 
what for ? 
ugh ! !   why do they have to do that ? 
try to . 
yes !   i believe i am ! 
maybe .   maybe .   the call of the wild ! 
oooooweee ! !   you shoulda seen me ! like i 'd been doin' it all my life ! nobody would ever believe it . 
are you sure we should be driving like this ?   in broad daylight and everything ? 
lemme see the map .

i 'm sorry .   well we need the money . now we have it . 
drive !   drive away ! 
do n't worry about it .   you want anything ? 
taking a shower . 
you know louise you 're supposed to be my best friend .   you could at least be a little bit happy for me . you could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life i have a sexual experience that is n't completely disgusting . 
i mean i finally understand what all the fuss is about .    this is just a whole ' nother ball game ! 
well i 'm not on drugs .   but i might be crazy . 
nothing .   why ?   do i seem different ? 
nothing .   it got messed up . 
you 're a vision louise a goddamn vision of loveliness you always are . 
i wo n't wait up . 
well boy he 's got his work cut out for him now do n't he ? 
you are so sweet to that guy you really are .   imagine not wanting to drag him into this .   he is a lucky man . 
so what are you gon na tell him ? 
i heard that . 
i do n't care what you say about him . the boy has got it bad . 
yup .   that 's him goin' .   i love to watch him go . 
she thinks he 's a pig . 
louise and darryl do n't get along . 
no louise .   how come you never said what happened ? 
i know louise but we 're running for our lives !   do n't you think you could make an exception just this once ? !   i mean look at the map . the only thing between oklahoma and mexico is texas ! 
wait .   what ?   you want to go to mexico from oklahoma and you do n't want to go through texas ? 
well it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards dallas then cut over to ... 
i just do n't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride .   did you see his butt ?   darryl does n't have a cute butt .   you could park a car in the shadow of his ass . 
i wish we could 've brought him with us . 
louise this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride and i thought since ... 
will i be ? 
call him ? 
i ... i do n't know .   i do n't know what you 're askin ' me . 
but you think he fools around . 
do you think darryl 's having an affair ? 
i called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he was n't even home .   i do n't know what he 's got to be mad about .   i 'm the one who should be mad . 
you talked to him ? !   is he mad ?   did you tell him ? 
do n't get mad louise but where are we going ? 
did you finish thinking ? 
my stuff 's in the trunk !   god !   you care more about that car than you do about most people . 
give me the keys . 
i suggested we go to the police but you did n't like that ; so frankly louise i 'm all out of ideas . 
actin ' like what ? !   how am i supposed to act ?   ' scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody 's head off ! 
what do you mean ? 
well when you figure it out wake me up . 
i 'm cash poor . 
what ?   oh i do n't know .   let me look . 
so this is all my fault is it . 
just what is that supposed to mean ? 
our next move ?   i 'll say one thing louise .   this is some vacation .   i sure am having a good time .   this is real fun . 
all of it .   that he tried to rape me . 
i do n't know .   just tell 'em what happened . 
should n't we go to the cops ?   i mean i think we should tell the police . 
louise .   where are we going ? 
shit !   i ... i which way ? 
jesus christ !   louise you shot him . 
oh my god . 
ready when you are . 
in the meantime you said we were gon na have some fun .   so let 's have some ! 
why do n't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all ? 
i 'm sorry louise .   i know you 're all upset .   it 's just i 'm so excited to be out of the house i guess .   i wonder if darryl 's home yet . 
so jimmy still has n't called yet ? 
well just relax will ya .   you 're makin ' me nervous . 
so what if he was ?   it 's all your years of waitin ' tables has made you jaded that 's all . 
jeez louise that was n't very nice . 
well i 've had it up to my ass with sedate !   you said you and me was gon na get outta town and for once just really let our hair down . well darlin ' look out 'cause my hair is comin ' down ! 
tell me somethin' .   is this my vacation or is n't it ?   i mean god you 're as bad as darryl . 
is n't this fun ? 
then what difference does it make if we stop ?   come on .   i never get to do stuff like this . 
i 'll never make it ... ca n't we stop just for a few minutes ... 
how much longer is it gon na be ?   i 'm hungry . 
well he has never let me go .   he never lets me do one goddamn thing that 's any fun .   all he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he 's out doing god only knows what . 
'cause i did n't ask him . 
i 've never had the chance to go out of town without darryl . 
whose place is this again ? 
we 'd have to .   that thing barely makes it down the driveway . 
in case there 's some escaped psycho killer on the loose who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us . 
i wanna take it anyway .   just in case . 
i do n't know how to fish louise . 
okay .   i will too . 
what kind of stuff do i bring ? 
what time are you gon na pick me up ? 
i 'll call you right back . 
he already thinks you 're out of your mind louise that do n't carry much weight with darryl .   are you at work ? 
well wait now .   i still have to ask darryl if i can go . 
damn .   i hate that !   i hate bein ' called a beaver do n't you ? 
you probably even called us beavers on your cb radio did n't you ? 
where you goin' ? 
we 're fine !   how are you ? 
you know certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind things like incarceration cavity search life imprisonment death by electrocution that sort of thing . so come out alive ?   i do n't know . let us think about that . 
would you believe me if i told you this whole thing is an accident ? 
well we 're not in the middle of nowhere but we can see it from here . 
weird .   got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin' . 
sure .   maybe over coffee sometime . i 'll buy . 
we 're both fine . 
yes sir .   i know . 
i 've been better . 
damn jimmy did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff ? 
believe me the last thing i want is for you to get punished . 
i do n't know .   it does n't even matter anymore .   i just want you to be happy ... it 's not that i do n't love you either .   but jimmy your timing could n't be worse . 
why now jimmy ? 
jimmy ... it 's beautiful ! 
stop it !   stop it jimmy or i 'll leave right now .   i 'm not kiddin ' ! 
it 's nothin' like that . 
jimmy my daddy 's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that ... 
it 's me . 
oh my god !   jimmy !   you ... oh my god !   what are you doin' here ? 
and what 's the mysterious code word ? 
good .   that was good .   where do i go ? 
you did n't say what it was for did you ? 
who did it ? 
is that how you answer the phone ? 
okay .   i 'll call you back .   in an hour .   do n't tell darryl . 
tell me now . 
ca n't it go to any office ? 
not yet .

fishing .   look jimmy ... i need you to help me .   this is serious .   i 'm in trouble and i need you to help me .   can you do that ? 
no i 'm out of town .   i 'm in ... i 'm in real deep shit jimmy .   deep shit arkansas . 
i am funny .   i 'm real funny . 
hi .   i 'm okay .   how are you ?   long time no see . 
am i in trouble ? 
in the back ? 
oh yeah . 
hello officer .   is there a problem ? 
you too sweetie the best . 
what are you talkin ' about ? 
we 're not giving up thelma . 
all this for us ? 
it 's grand ! 
it 's the goddamn grand canyon ! 
where ? ! 
what ? ! 
how do you stay so positive ? 
unbearable i 'd imagine . 
no ... you 've always been crazy . this is just the first chance you 've had to really express yourself . 
you too sweetie the best . 
you 're crazy . 
there 's one thing you oughta understand by now thelma it 's not your fault . 
they 'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas ! 
we probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck . 
what ? !   what d'you think ? ! 
about two hundred and fifty miles . 
yeah right .   we 're not gon na get caught . 
we 've gone insane . 
you know what 's happened do n't you ? 
texas ... you were right about what happened to me there . 
and oh my god that other thing that pointing to your lap ?   what 's that supposed to mean exactly ?   does that mean pull over i want to show you what a big fat slob i am or ... 
it 's him .   he 's got california plates .   it 's the same guy . 
we should head a little further in . there 's not that many roads in this state .   i want to try to hit mexico somewhere not so close to new mexico .   they probably wanna kill us in new mexico . 
it would have to be pretty damn good . 
yes !   yes !   now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that ? 
we can live in a hacienda . 
we 'll be drinkin ' margaritas by the sea mamasita . 
you could call it that .   my eyes are open . 
well let me know when you figure it out . 
sure ... you know how to hotwire a car ? 
and we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive . 
he said they 're charging us with murder . 
i know .   i know what you mean .   i do n't wanna end up on the damn geraldo show . 
thelma that is not an option . 
no thelma .   i 'm not gon na make any deals . 
what do you mean ? 
yes thelma ? 
i said all that ? 
what 'd i say again ? 
i think i 've really fucked up .   i think i 've got us in a situation where we could both get killed .   why did n't we just go straight to the police . 
shit .   i 'm gettin ' tired . 
you do ? 
and i do n't want any more wild turkey either .   it 's burning a hole in my stomach . 
i do n't care what the damn pioneers ate .   you just keep that shit away from me now i mean it . 
i do n't want to see any more beef jerky .   i mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window . it 's drivin ' me crazy .   the whole car smells like it . 
well i figure if you take a state policeman shoot up his car take his gun and lock him in the trunk it 's best to just get on out of the state if you can . 
i believe you . 
i am really sorry about this . 
about how fast was i going ? 
i do n't know !   shit !   let 's just play it by ear .   he may not know . he may just give me a ticket . 
i 'm warning you thelma .   you better drop it right now !   i do n't want to talk about it ! 
i do n't want to talk about it ! thelma i 'm not kidding !   do n't you even ... 
now thelma that is not ... 
what ? !   what about him ? ! 
what ? ! 
what ?   what 's not funny thelma ! 
oh christ .   i hate this guy . 
look !   look who it is thelma .   i 'll be darned .   what 's he doin' way out here . 
well you got it now . 
gosh .   it sure is . 
well now maybe you wo n't have to . 
i can see that . 
yeah .   those .   that always put the fear of god in me .   what about you ? 
those too but you know those little hairy ones ?   those flat - faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth ? 
you know those little dogs you see people with ? 
i guess i always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs . 
you mean now or before ? 
oh i do n't know thelma .   i guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on saturdays .   maybe we could have children with the prison guards . 
now what what ? 
oklahoma thelma .   we 're crossing into new mexico . 
just past boise city . 
just stop talkin ' to people thelma ! stop bein ' so open !   we 're fugitives now .   let 's behave that way ! 
why not ? !   what 's he got to lose ? other than my life 's savings that is .   shit ! 
you told that thievin ' little shit where we were goin' ? ! 
how 'd they find out we 're going to mexico thelma how they know that ? 
that j.d. kid is a little shit . 
fill her up .   there 's a phone right over there . 
besides what do we say about the robbery ?   no excuse for that .   no such thing as justifiable robbery . 
no physical evidence .   we ca n't prove he did it .   we probably ca n't even prove he touched you by now . 
it wo n't work . 
but it was n't !   we got away !   we were walkin ' away ! 
oh come on !   murder one and armed robbery thelma ! 
to find out if he knows anything . if you think he does you got ta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped . 
i want you to call darryl . 
they think we like it .   maybe they think it turns us on . 
so what 's the plan thelma ?   you just gon na stay drunk ? 
you 're disturbed . 
you think you 've found your calling ? 
no we should n't but i want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last goddamn crime ! 
for the first time in my life i wish this car was n't green . 
holy shit . 
okay .   shit thelma !   what 'd you do ? i mean what did you say ? 
oh shit thelma ! !   shit !   shit ! shit ! 
what happened ? 
eighty - eight dollars ai n't gon na make a dent baby girl . 
you left that guy alone in the room ? 
i 'm sorry .   i am happy .   i 'm very happy for you .   i 'm glad you had a good time .   it 's about time .   where is he now ? 
thelma please get a hold of yourself .   you 're making a spectacle . 
oh thelma .   oh no . 
i do n't think i wanna hear what you 're gon na tell me . 
yes now that you mention it .   you seem crazy .   like you 're on drugs . 
what 's wrong with you ? 
what happened to your hair ? 
have another drink thelma . 
how do i look ? 
put a lid on it thelma !   it 's hard enough as it is .   just let me get this part over with .   now stay here and guard the money .   if there 's any problem i 'm in room 115 . 
i did n't ask him to come !   it 's like i said thelma he just loves the chase . 
nothing .   i 'm not gon na tell him a thing .   the least i can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is . 
he 's always got it bad as long as i 'm running in the other direction . do n't be fooled he 's no different than any other guy .   he knows how to chase and that 's it .   once he 's caught you he do n't know what to do .   so he runs away . 
thelma kinda took to him . 
he 's a real piece o ' work .   i wish you could meet him . 
that 's puttin ' it mildly . 
he 's got a lot to be proud of . 
thelma !   i 'm not gon na talk about this !   now find another way or give me the goddamn map and i will !   you understand ? 
you know how i feel about texas ... we 're not going that way . 
i do n't want to go that way .   find a way that we do n't have to go through texas . 
i 'm sorry .   i 'm just not in the mood for company right now .   here .   take this map .   i need you to find all the secondary roads to mexico from oklahoma city .   i think we should stay off the interstates .   we 're too conspicuous . 
what did darryl say ? 
it 's probably not a good idea . 
i do n't know .   i wo n't be . 
call him .   do n't tell him anything . tell him you 're having a wonderful time and you 'll be home tomorrow night . 
do n't you fall apart on me . goddamnit thelma .   every time we get in trouble you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit and this time ... not this time . everything 's changed now ... now you can do whatever you want but i 'm going to mexico .   i 'm going .   are you coming with me ? 
thelma i 'm going to mexico .   i think i can make it in two and a half days but i 'm going to have to haul ass .   are you up to this ?   i mean i have to know .   this is n't a game .   i 'm in deep shit .   i got ta know what you 're gon na do . 
i do n't think darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair . 
i 've been tellin ' you that for the last ten years . 
no i did n't tell him .   and that 's something we got ta get straight . darryl 's been callin ' mad as a hornet makin ' all kinds of noise . when you talk to him you can not say anything about this .   you got ta make sure everything sounds normal . 
oklahoma city .   jimmy 's gon na wire me some money and then ... 
i think better when i drive . 
most people just cause me trouble but that car always gets me out of it . 
you 're not touchin ' that car . 
well what 's the big rush thelma ? if we just give 'em some time they 'll come to us ... !   oh christ . i 'm just not ready to go to jail yet .   why do n't you go out to the pool or something and i 'll figure it out ... 
you could help me try and figure it out !   i got ta figure out what to do and you could try and help me . 
why are you actin ' like this ? 
just what the hell is wrong with you ? 
oh i do n't know .   i 'm just nervous . i got ta figure out what to do . 
hmmm .   we got ta get some money . 
we 're gon na go to the next town and stop .   we 'll get a motel room .   i can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money .   we 're gon na need money .   thelma .   how much money do you have with you ? 
it means shut up thelma . 
if you were n't so concerned with having a good time we would n't be here right now . 
we have to think this through .   we have to be smart .   now is not the time to panic .   if we panic now we 're done for .   nobody saw it . nobody knows it was us .   we 're still okay .   now all we have to do is just figure out our next move . 
it means you do n't talk to anybody . you do n't draw attention to yourself in any way .   do you understand that ? 
we got ta be inconspicuous .   do you know what that means ? 
only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night thelma !   who 's gon na believe that ? !   we just do n't live in that kind of world .   pull over ! 
which part ? 
tell them what ? !   what thelma ? what do you think we should tell them ? 
i do n't know thelma !   i do n't know ! just shut up a minute so i can think . 
west .   left . 
get the car ! 
get the car . 
thelma i 'm gon na hit the little girls ' room and then we got ta hit the road . 
why do n't you ditch that loser husband of yours ? 
i wonder if jimmy 's gotten back . 
givin ' him a taste of his own medicine .   asshole . 
ca n't you tell when somebody 's hittin ' on you ? 
alright ...   i changed my mind .   i 'll have a margarita with and a shot of cuervo on the side please . 
i just have n't seen you like this in a while .   i 'm used to seeing you more sedate . 
i have n't seen a place like this since i left texas . 
we 've not gon na get to the cabin till after dark as it is thelma . 
another hour of so .   we 've got enough food for a month . 
aw shit thelma he 's gon na kill you . 
how come he let you go ? 
it 's bob 's the day manager 's .   he 's gettin ' a divorce so his wife 's gettin ' this place so he 's just lettin ' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys . 
oh yeah sure thelma that lantern will come in real handy .   maybe we could tow your car behind in case he steals the spark plugs . 
in case of what ? 
we do n't need the lantern .   the place has electricity . 
neither do i thelma but darryl does it how hard can it be ?   i 'll see you later .   be ready . 
and steal darryl 's fishin ' stuff . 
i do n't know .   warm stuff i guess . it 's the mountains .   i guess it gets cold at night .   i 'm just gon na bring everything . 
you 're kiddin ' !   alright !   i 'll be there around two or three . 
not this weekend sweetie she 's runnin ' away with me .   hi .   what 'd he say ? 
no i 'm callin ' from the playboy mansion . 
you mean you have n't asked him yet ? for christ sake thelma is he your husband or your father ?   it 's just two days .   for god 's sake thelma . do n't be a child .   just tell him you 're goin' with me for cryin ' out loud .   tell him i 'm havin' a nervous breakdown . 
are you going to apologize or not ? 
say you 're sorry . 
you got that right . 
you know good and damn well what i 'm talkin ' about . 
we been seein ' you all along the way . 
stop it ! 
stop that ! no ! somebody help me ! ! ! ! ! 
i 'm asking you to leave . 
woogie i caught you red - handed . 
that 's great woogie i 'm happy you 're better -- you seem ... good --but ... you put me through quite an ordeal you know . 
well ... thank you . but ... you know you 're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me . 
you sent that ? 
are you crazy ? why would i pick you ? you 're a murderer . 
woogie please you 're starting to scare me . 
uh hey buddy . oh boy am i pissed . you 're not going to believe this -- well you 'll believe it there 's no reason not to -- but i just got beeped for emergency surgery . well um sorry but i 'm going to have to bail on you . 
we 're gon na go out tonight . oh that reminds me i 've got to call what's- his - face and cancel . 
are you okay ? 
forget it . it was ... fun . 
all set . 
turn it up magda . 
huh ... that 's strange . 
come on what were you going to say ? 
i guess . 
pat i 'm not kidding . i really think it 's the greatest -- 
harold and maude is my all - time favorite movie . 
a fucking moron . 
have you seen it ? 
you 're a movie buff ? 
why bounce when you have your own condo in nepal to go to ? 
yeah i think it 's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint . look at this ... 
sadly no . well except for the lint . 
magda ? she 's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine . her husband passed away a couple years ago so she does n't like to be alone . 
how about -- ? 
would you call that a portico or a vestibule ? 
is this one art deco or art nouveau ? 
we just got here thirty seconds ago . is n't this stuff great ? 
i know he 's around here someplace . 
the architecture exhibit ! my friend tucker is going to be here . he 's an architect too . you guys will have tons to talk about . 
we will but first i have a surprise . 
here you go .   what 's that smell ? 
sorry pat out of beer . you like vodka ? 
wow i 've never seen him like this . he does n't usually like guys . 
look uh i was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime . 
that sounds like fun . 
they keep him confined ? that 's bullshit ! 
-- he 's in a cage ? ! 
no i mean 
is n't that a little politically incorrect ? 
i beg your pardon ? 
what 's that ? 
are you ... an architect ? 
what are you doing with all these blueprints ? 
how 'd you know that ? 
do n't you want to know my name ? 
by the way what 's your name ? 
well it was nice meeting you again . 
wow . that 's a place i 've always wanted to go . is it true the mountains are so tall you ca n't see the tops ? 
you own a home there ? 
nepal ? have you been ? 
no thanks . 
yeah do n't talk in someone 's backswing . 
i 'm just saying i do n't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly . it means he 's a guy . you can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections . 
i do n't want someone who 'll put up with him . i want someone who will enjoy him the way i do . do you know what he told my friend tucker ? he said he would 've popped the question a lot earlier if warren was n't in my life .   well he is in my life and i 'm goddamn lucky to have him . the hell with steve . 
ah she 's okay . 
i do n't know it was complicated . he 's in san francisco i 'm in miami .   besides magda 's psychic dog hated him . 
yeah steve . steve was all right for awhile . 
no i 'm not . 
what 's that supposed to mean ? 
but here 's the rub . the guy i 'm talking about has got to be self- employed . 
i 'm sick of these calorie - countin ' pansies . give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and warren out to a ballgame . 
ugh not pecs . sounds like one of those guys with a fish - net shirt and a banana hammock . 
where 's puffy ? 
holy shit ... 
i ca n't do it -- i just found out it 's his birthday .   i guess i 've got ta cancel on ted . 
kind of . ted peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world . 
love ? come on i would n't call it love . 
so maybe i could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies . 
do n't get ahead of yourself . you 'll probably need it before i will . 
must have a sweet tooth . see if you can find some cookies . 
sure .   uh magda why do n't you get some more cheese and crackers ... ? 
the point is love is n't about money or social standing or age it 's about connecting with someone having things in common kindred spirits . 
this one 's almost thirty years old . it 's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love . 
come on magda   it 's like that movie harold and maude . 
you know a mookalone a schlep . 
i do n't know . he 's kind of a mook . 
he 's no steve young . 
name 's patrick i met him at the driving range . 
no time magda my show 's starting . 
okay you win . now try to get some sleep huh . 
magda puffy barks at everybody . 
you picked that up on the scanner . we got ta move . 
neighborhood watch ? is that what you call listening in on stranger 's phone conversations ? 
have you been up all night again ? 
oh jesus ... 
you mean he 's not a criminal ? 
yeah yeah . okay i think i know what to do . i 'll call him right now . 
magda 's right i 'm so lucky to have you in my life . 
i ca n't believe this is happening . i 'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour . 
what ... ? 
tucker i appreciate you doing all this but i 'm really strapped for time here and -- 
what 's up ? 
can i pour you one ? 
i appreciate you looking out for me . 
no no no tucker thank you . 
i 've been looking for a guy -- not one of these south beach pussies . 
not long at all but i really like him .   okay i know he 's a little different tucker but that 's what i like about him . he 's a guy . a real guy . he dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he is n't always politically correct and he probably farts too . and that 's okay with me . 
he 's a nice guy is n't he ? 
no no the bigger the better .   but i must say they could be a little brighter . nothing 's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites . 
tucker you look different some how . did you do something with your hair ? 
pat does projects all over the world . 
pat 's an architect too . 
get over here . 
oh yeah that 'd make golf real fun -- the guy does n't even drink beer or gamble . 
but i think i 'd be happiest ... with you . 
ted ... ? 
you forgot your keys ! 
woogie and i went out for awhile in high school . 
please leave . 
then what the fuck did you do it for ? 
what did you think ted ? that you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone i could ... really go for ? 
that you put a murderer on my trail ? 
get out . 
toy poodle ! 
um ted i need a moment with magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom . 
that 's really sweet ted but you should save it for one of your books . 
why not ? 
ted ... you 're not that far ahead . 
yeah ... almost .   you want to come up and watch sportscenter ? 
... and then it was all over .   we have n't spoken since . 
i do n't know ... my friends think i 'm too picky . i think i 'm just a weirdo magnet . i did come close once -- just last year in fact . there was this guy he lived in san francisco . 
that 's right . and the good thing is you can do it anywhere . 
well good for you . i bet it works out for you . 
so you 're a writer ? 
ah my roots here are too deep . i love my practice the people i work with warren 's got a nice thing going   why do n't you just move down here and marry me ? 
we 've got a lot in common . 
it 's too bad you do n't live down here ted . 
i like it . and think of the toppings -- cheese mushrooms mint jelly 
i agree there should be more . 
nitrate - sicles -- i like that . 
okay sometimes i 'm a nineteen . 
twenty - two . 
we should play some time ... i mean if you can afford to lose some money . 
you hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen . 
well lucky for me i found out . thank god i have friends like tucker .   look i 'm sick of talking about stalkers .   let 's talk about you . 
i mean he murdered someone and did time back in boston . the guy 's a freak . 
oh great i ran out . 
on your ear you 've got something . 
what 's that ? 
hi ted . 
i 'm kidding . i 'd really love to ted but the thing is i already have plans . how about tomorrow night ? 
nope have n't walked the plank yet .   there was this guy back in college who was bothering me ... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order the whole bit . anyway when i got out of princeton i changed my name as a precaution . 
actually it 's mary brooks now . 
well you look great . are you married do you have kids ? 
oh . so ... what brings you down here ? 
oh ted i 'm so sorry to hear that . 
by the way how 's he doing ? 
that 's weird . i talked to your brother jimmy five or six times . 
i ca n't believe he remembered you . he never remembers anybody .   you know i tried to call you for weeks after that . 
and did everything -- ? 
oh my god ... ted .   what are you ... ? i ca n't believe this . i have n't seen you since -- 
who 's that ? 
ted i 'm so sorry . are you going to be okay ? 
ted are you okay ? 
are you all right ? 
i 'm sorry . i should 've told you he 's got a thing about his ears . 
hi ted . 
'cause i thought maybe you and i could go if you were n't already taking someone . 
the prom -- you going ? 
so who you taking to the prom ? 
oh he can hold you . he weighs two- hundred - and - thirty pounds . 
oh are you on the team ? 
hey you 're limping . did you just hurt yourself ? 
thanks a lot ted . 
aw christ i ca n't take it anymore . i 'm gon na pack my bags and go back to my own place . 
would you like a little clam - dip honey ? 
would you like a glass of tea or something ? 
he can tell you 're an animal nut . you are are n't ya ? 
you mean he does n't like bad guys . 
this is a good one mare . sounds like his partner 's all lubed up . 
ah he was being a pest so i put him in the bathroom . 
oh hi hon . just straightening up . 
the little shit lied to me about that guy ! 
puffy get over here . 
you vicious bitch how do you sleep at night ? 
an old flame ? 
oh no ? i ai n't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the blue monster . 
knock it off pollyanna just 'cause you 're in love does n't mean everyone else has to be . 
do n't bet on it . last time i had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker . 
back when i was your age i always used to make myself a big banana split after sex . i think you 're gon na need one tonight . 
i 'm buying bananas tonight . 
hey hey what did you say pat 's last name was ? 
bundt cake ? 
oh yeah of course dear . 
fuck kindred spirits . my little puffy here 's gon na tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat . if he starts yapping he 's a loser ; if puffy 's relaxed ... well you got yourself a keeper . 
that 's exactly why i do n't watch 'em anymore -- it 's bullshit ! why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid ? 
i do n't watch the new ones . 
then why you going out with him if he 's a schlep ? 
what 's a mook ? 
what 's he like ? 
good lookin ' ? 
so who 's the lucky guy ? 
jesus mary you got ta hear this -- some cop 's staking out this broad 's apartment . 
that 's because there 's a lot of bad people out there . hey puffy tried to warn you about that steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself did n't you ? 
i confirmed it on the scanner . i knew something was up because puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know puffy only barks at bad people . 
meaning these are the people you live amongst you got a right to know if they 're creeps . for instance did you know there 's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife ? 
these ai n't strangers they 're neighbors . this only picks up signals in a half - mile radius . 
bet your ass i have . it 's an important job neighborhood watch is . 
i live here remember ? 
you got your f-14 you got top gun you got your migs .... you're our new top gun instructor ... now what ? 
i think i have ... i could be wrong . i have been before . just remember one thing . if you 're not top gun if you 're not fighting jets you 're not gon na be able to act like a fighter pilot ... you 're gon na have to act like the rest of us . you 're gon na have to master humility . for you guys that 's the toughest maneuver of all . 
hey i never said i was a fighter pilot ... i never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm . i can find contentment in a good book . i do n't have to roar by someone at mach two with my hair on fire . sometimes ... i just get happy being with the right man . 
and i 'm gon na sneak off and be by myself for awhile like until i can think of a new career ... hotel management or something ... 
i know exactly what you mean . 
long distance ? i would n't do that to you . i 'd at least talk to you . 
you were n't gon na say goodbye ? 
we 'll say it together . on the count of three ... one ... two ... 
looks like a tie . 
your watch . 
and that 's one ! 
you did n't mean it . you did n't think . you 'd do anything to take it back . 
that was n't fair . it was a question . penalty round ! 
that 's up to you . 
take something off . 
the big one . the one that 's most on your mind . 
you say the truth .   go ahead . do n't be afraid . you want to win the game don'tcha ? 
want to play the game ? 
not as silly as some . you know the silliest one ? ... that we are gods . that we control events on the beach ... that we can turn back time ... 
it 's like strip poker only without the bluffing .   one person says something and if the other one accepts that it 's true the one who says it gets to take one item of clothing off . 
it 's strip reality actually like what the pilots always want to play . 
i sit . i think . i play games . 
everything passes . immutable law of the universe . 
only when you 're depressed . then it passes . 
you do n't believe that . 
of course the line 's just imaginary . you can cross it twenty times ... nothing really changes . 
you look way out there . out past the date line . west becomes east all things change . you cross the line ... today becomes yesterday ... or tomorrow i forget which . 
what do you want ? 
i do n't think so but if that 's what you want ... 
do what show you a good time ? 
where are we ? you know where we are . it 's called the beach . it 's where life first crawled up out of the sea . i come here sometimes ... when i feel like crawling back in . 
you knew it . you all do . it 's part of it . maybe the most important part . 
why ? you act like you did n't know one day this would happen . 
that 's what you get flight pay for . 
that 's not what i hear . 
the dark side . the price you pay for all the fun you 're having . you knew about it of course . did n't you ? 
this is it then . 
... they say you 're alright . 
where 'd you get it . 
what do you take me for ? it 's a navy cross . 
does n't it ever bother you ? 
i do n't fly in anything that does n't show movies . 
i 'm still second best . 
in that order ? 
i 'm a professional . you guys are in my line of work . 
no fooling on base no signs no comments no talk . by anyone . 
i want it understood . 
you always get what you want ? 
and now ? 
i do n't know . i do n't like being out of control . 
you 're totally insane . 
it 's just as i thought . 
are you really that brave ? 
what if you kill yourself ? think of everything you 'll miss . maverick there is lots of stuff i do n't know about ...   fine wine ... great art ... the opera . i guess if i live long enough i 'll get to it . if i do n't i 'll never miss it . 
winston churchill . 
you do n't believe any of this . you do n't think you 'll ever die . 
does it bother you ? 
you ever think about killing another human being ? 
you do n't have to kill it . 
you 're horrible 
i do n't enjoy watching things suffer . 
you 're an animal . 
why 'd you do that ? 
okay anything . just ... go . i 've got ta work . 
make what ? 
i 'm starting to sense that now . 
used to what ? 
most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit ... play with the levers and things . maverick well get used to it . 
what about the plane ? 
hard to argue with that is n't it ... 
how about what ? 
and probably never again . it 's nothing personal . it 's just ... i know a lot of pilots . maybe i 'm immune ... 
you have to shoot him down .... if he 's smart he 'll turn away before that happens . 
uh hum . 
you turn into him check him out identify friend or foe . 
some one comes up hot on your six what do you do ? 
maverick ... you know the rules of engagement . 
i ca n't . 
yes . i 'll give you that ! 
i do n't mix with the boys . i work here . let 's keep it professional . 
there you go with those moves again . 
apology acknowledged . 
for what ? 
and far too aggressive . 
you know i 'm assigned to this school . i see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks . your attention is flattering but not really productive . why do n't you keep your mind on flying . 
you seemed determined to do that anyway .. why did n't you tell me you were a famous mig insulter ? maverick would it have made a difference ? 
it never came up . 
the what ? 
two miles . 
if you were directly above him how did you see him ? 
he was in a 4 g negative dive and you were on his six ? 
where were you ? 
lieutenant i have a top secret clearance . the pentagon sees to it that i know more than you . 
it 's what ? 
where did you see that ? 
you saw a mig 21 ? 
why not ? 
i beg your pardon . 
that 's all ! 
how did you know this was my car ? 
what if captain dawson had come with me ? 
i 'm with someone . 
was there ever a girl who did n't like fighter pilots ? 
and on to a bigger one with you ? 
how so ? 
that 's a big comfort to me . 
it is n't ? 
now i know why all the girls come here . they know how horny you guys get . but this ... is ridiculous . 
yeah . hold this . it might be safer . 
i 'll bet ! 
how could you do this ?   you 're a mutant . 
but maybe you can change all that . 
shut up and drive ! 
the last resort !   quick ! 
then kiss me quick ... before you wake up . 
what 's wrong ? 
enough for everybody to breathe ? 
of course not .   if mars had an atmosphere he 's lose control . 
you sure about this ? 
aliens ? ! 
people are dying quaid ! !   stop ! !   we 've got to get air ! ! 
what reactor ? ! 
where are you going ? ! 
i 'm not sure dear ?   what do you think ? 
you two - faced - bastard . 
oh since when ? 
all sorts of things .   you might even remember you loved me . 
kuato 's gon na make you remember a few things you knew when you were hauser . 
the first settlers are buried here . they worked themselves to death but cohaagen ended up with all the money . he built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks . 
i 'm not a hooker !   that 's my cover . 
i used to model for 'em why ? 
kuato wants to see you .   come on ! 
if cohaagen wants you dead you might be okay . 
i said get out ! 
get out ! 
i 'm not falling for it . 
i think you better leave . 
you never loved me hauser !   you just used me to get inside . 
because you 're still working for cohaagen . 
no . let 's forget everything !   i 've had it with you and your goddamn lies . 
oh she is n't really your wife .   how stupid of me ... she was hauser 's wife . 
wait did you say wife? ... are you fuckin ' married ! ! ? 
this is too weird . 
hauser you 're lost your mind . 
hauser ?   you 're hauser . 
what did you get amnesia? ... how'd you get here ? 
what are you talking about ? 
... what ? 
you could n't get me a message ?   you never wondered what happened to me ? 
i thought cohaagen tortured you to death ! 
i think it 's still hungry . 
ooo whatcha been feeding that thing ? 
i love you . 
doug do n't ! 
nooo !   i would never do anything to hurt you .   i want you to come back to me . 
i love you . 
i 'm here at rekall . 
doug ... you would n't shoot me would you ?   after all we 've been through ? 
it 's time you found out . 
you sure you do n't wanna ... ?   for old time 's sake .   if you do n't trust me you can tie me up . 
but doug ... there 's something i want you to know .   you 're the best assignment i ever hand .   really . 
beats me .   i just work here . 
the job 's real . -- but the agency set it up . 
it was implanted by the agency . 
i swear to god! ... i never saw you before six weeks ago !   our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh ! 
i 'm not your wife . 
doug nobody tried to kill you . 
oh god doug . 
what did they do to you ?   tell me ! 
you went to those brain butchers ? ! 
mars ?   you 've never even been to mars . 
muggers ? !   doug are you all right ? what happened ? 
what are you doing ? 
you are somebody .   you 're the man i love . 
sweetheart ... i know it 's hard being in a new town but let 's at least give it a chance here .   okay ? 
well ... what do you say ? 
there 's lots nicer places than mars . 
doug maybe we should take a trip . 
and you believe him ? 
sweetheart we 've been through this a million times .   you 'd hate it on mars . it 's dry ; it 's ugly ; it 's boring !   --i mean really a revolution could break out there any minute . 
honey do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning . 
do what ? 
yeah sweetheart ? 
... you mean it ? 
let me go ! 
it 's not funny doug .   you dream about her every night . 
tell me ! 
nobody ? !   what 's her name ? 
who is she ? 
the brunette .   the one you told me about . 
poor baby .   this is getting to be an obsession . 
is that better ? 
well yeah !   there 's going to be major research up here .   first thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up . 
you 're really leaving huh ? 
hi guys .   burt loaned me his camera . 
nope there !   that 's one . 
could we make it to the mountains ? 
we 're not going over there right ? 
val stop !   they're coming !   don't move ! 
oh my god . 
well we can take my truck then . 
the mountains are solid granite . we 'd be safe there and we could hike along them ... all the way to bixby if we have to . 
well i 'm scared but i 'm not sorry . 
well i was wondering if we could ... 
i might have an idea ... 
there 's nothing like them in the fossil record i 'm sure ... okay so they predate the fossil record ...   that 'd make them a couple of billion years old ... and we 've just never seen one till now .   right . 
probably could n't move too easily on the surface . 
yeah i 'm lucky it did n't find < u > me</u > .   this is important you know .   this is like well let 's say it it 's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century .   the century ?   forget it .   < u > history</u > . 
i do n't see any eyes ... must be totally subterranean ... and those tentacles ... 
thanks .   god i hope they 're not screwed up .   i might have to bag the whole semester . anyway sorry to bother you . 
it worked !   there they go ! 
wait !   how are you going to know they 're all following it ? 
listen they only respond to vibration right ?   could n't we ... distract them somehow ? 
look the situation has n't changed . we still have to get to solid rock . there must be < u > some</u > way ! 
you guys do all the odd jobs . 
yeah they 're confused .   they can feel our vibrations but they ca n't find us . 
why do you all keep asking me ? 
it does . 
yes see they move very easily through the pleistocene alluvials ...   ... the dirt ... the loose soil that makes up the valley floor .   but they ca n't move through solid rock . i think we should travel west to the mountains . 
let 's assume that it is . 
yeah .   but i 'll tell you if you ever wanted proof god is a man this is it . 
darn it ! 
well i 'm supposed monitor these seismographs .   you know they measure vibrations ... 
listen got a question for you .   do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that ? 
right geology .   and you have to be val and earl .   i 've heard all about you . 
hi i 'm rhonda .   rhonda lebeck . i 'm up here for the semester ... 
i need sleep . some of us are mere mortals . 
eddie ... go home . get some sleep . 
eddie ... a guilty client 's not the end of the world ... 
eddie this is silly ... are we supposed to pretend nothing 's happened in the last ten years and -- 
eddie if i wanted to make love with you again i 'd do it sober . 
i 'm a professional eddie . getting paid is all the thanks i require . 
a number of them are dead three are in prison one 's a waiter ... two -- you 'll enjoy this -- two are actually members of the chamber of commerce . 
eddie these things take time . particularly at this hour ... 
i did n't put him in a wheelchair . reynard did . he can get around without one -- it 's all in my report . 
i 've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the tri - state area . no one 's heard of chuckie roeder . 
so there goes your theory about the joes giving up shu to protect their trigger man . 
i was never politically correct enough for comrade dowd . 
i 'm kicking myself eddie ... right out of here . 
just which constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle pcp ? 
beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors . 
eddie i 'm not working on this case . you boys have fun . 
you 're doing a murder case ? 
no -- leave him be . it 's better for everyone . 
it 's okay . it was always like that . 
but they 've still got laura gordon -- and she was the closest about 20 feet from the killer . 
you getting this ? 
so what 'd this guy do ? snitch off a dealer ? 
my skip - trace turned up two cecil stipes . one 's in butte montana . other 's at riverhead veterans psychiatric . 
you read eddie 's chase manhattan bombing summation in the leftist law anthology ? 
no . never . you 'll have to kill me . 
who are you ? who are you really ? 
no ! god no ... 
go away . i am not talking to you . 
no ... no go away .

what is your wife 's picture doing by the side of your ... 
oh yes i do joe . believe me . you say you 're going to lose . is it my fault ? listen ! the damned case does n't start until tomorrow and already it 's over for you ! 
you 're like a kid you 're coming in here like it 's saturday night you want me to say that you 've got a fever -- you do n't have to go to school ... 
not if you do n't grow up ... 
maybe i 'll tell you later . 
you told me so . maybe you 'd get some sympathy . you came to the wrong place . 
you want me to tell you it 's your fault ? it probably is . what are you going to do about it ?   i thought it 's not over till the jury comes in . 
you do what you want . you want to leave ... you want to go kill yourself ? 
well then what are you doing here ? 
and it 's over ... ? 
you 're talking like a drunk . 
is n't there something you ... 
you ca n't work if you ca n't think . you get in bed . it 's all right . i 'll stay here with you . it 's all right . come on ... 
why do n't you get some rest ? 
do you want me to go ... ? 
... and is that serious ? 
what happened ... ? 
is this a bad time . 
would you like me to leave ... ?   is this a bad time -- ? 
and is that what you 're going to do ?   is that what you 're going to do ... ? 
maybe what ? 
and are they going to get it ? 
i think i will . 
what if it was n't you that i came back to see ? 
who says i 'm the one that called it off ? 
yes . it was actually . 
my ex - husband was a lawyer . 
and what are you ? a cop ? 
the tv did n't work . 
i changed my room at the hotel . 
still looking . 
me too . 
the big boy did ... ? 
should i ? 
how'm i doing so far ? 
are we going to win ?   we have you know other tactics though ... 
what does it mean ?   i ... i mean we you have other tactics ... 
we just ca n't do it anymore .   this is our chance to get away . 
he saw her at the northern care ... 
... but dick he 's looking for two years in tucson ... and they called him up and said to come out . he 's a good man . he 's only trying to do what 's right . 
my doctor told me that i got to move out west ... that 's when we filed in court . we did n't want to sue ... 
i do n't want to leave her . dick ... the the ... and father laughlin he said that it was god 's will ... 
you know how beautiful she was ?   her husband left her and he took her kids ... they they they 'd let you die in there . they do n't care . nobody cares . the patriot home the chronic care ... in arlington ... ? they 'd take her in . perpetual care . they 'd take her . fifty thousand dollars they want . an endowment . 
... you saw her ? 
but what can we do ? she do n't know who 's visiting her ... 
... we we love her dick and me ... 
it 's locked . 
do n't let 's lose each other . 
i probably would n't be able to get to them if i tried ... 
i wonder if they 're going through this too ... ? 
how 'd you guess ? 
my kid brother has one .   you know why ? 
very futuristic .   yours does n't really go with that butch haircut ! 
is it possible to go in right after the explosion ? 
they 've blocked it ! 
they could be as curious about us as we are about them . 
i could n't see much in the dark - but it was one ! 
it was ...   ... one of them ! 
hours .   i 've been so scared ... ! 
he liked you ... i could bawl my head off ! 
i stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me .   it was uncle matthew who found me . 
i feel like i did one time when i was small .   awful scared and lonesome ... i'd wandered off - i 've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me .   they found me in a church .   i was afraid to go in any place else . 
but they seem to murder everything that moves ... ! 
it does ... maybe that 's why i feel kind of lost right now . 
i come from a big one .   nine of us . all in minnesota except me . 
do n't you live at home ? 
where are we ? 
is that ... machine ... ? 
i never noticed before - that 's a cowboy tie .... 
you 'll hit something !   ca n't you go higher ? 
can you handle one of these ? 
would you like some coffee general ? 
you never know where you 're going to wind up when you go to a square dance ! 
did n't you have something to do with this ?   i know you sent word to the sixth army command ! 
how does it happen cars are running ? 
they 've all stopped at the same time . 
i might have recognized you without the beard .   and you did n't wear glasses on the ' time ' cover ! 
well you certainly do n't look like yourself in that get - up !   but i am happy to meet you anyway . i 'm sylvia van buren .   i teach library science over at usc . 
what 's he like ? 
how can you say that when you do n't know him ! 
forrester 's the man behind the new atomic engines .   they had him on the cover of ' time ' .   you 've got to rate to get that ! 
why sure -- i got it !   do you have a match ? 
well i did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my masters degree . 
he 's top man in astro and nuclear physics .   he knows all about meteors ! 
it hit sideways and skidded in . 
you must have caught plenty with all that tackle ! 
did you see it come down ? 
yes ... ugly looking is n't it . 
let 's go back inside uncle matthew . 
but they 're not human !   dr. forrester says they 're some kind of an advanced civilization -- 
they do n't do much of anything ... ! 
uncle matthew ... this is dr. clayton forrester .   my uncle - dr. matthew collins pastor of the community church . 
it was nearer than that . 
like weird calls by any chance ? 
and since you 've been thinking of making it .   has anything funny happened ? 
bob how long has wes been working on this script ? 
yes but ... 
and i ... i've got other things happening . 
so i do n't know about horror . 
i do n't know bob .   i 'm flattered and all but i 've got a kid now . 
you mean that was a ... 
can i read it ? 
the nightmares . 
which means he 's having nightmares again ? 
i thought he 'd stopped doing horror . 
i thought you 'd killed freddy off . 
do n't speed chase .   it 's not ... 
chase .   why did n't chuck or terry show up ? 
like freddy . 
he was just acting very strange .   he thinks somebody 's after him chase . it 's scary it scared me .   he was acting like ... 
he 's had some sort of ... episode . 
chase it 's dylan ! 
chase you 'd better come home . 
chase . hi ... 
guess so . 
just be careful okay ? 
it was nothing .   we were both working on some movie and a special effects thing went horribly wrong .   terry and chuck were ... hurt .   you were almost ...   you were even cut . 
what if it is n't over ? 
no you do n't . 
maybe .   or maybe i should n't do this interview today . 
five earthquakes in three weeks is enough . 
more or less .   dylan time to get dressed .   i 'm late . 
dylan it 's breakfast .   not arts and crafts   what ? 
one of mom 's cups got broken . 
no biggie really . 
he sleepwalks you idiot !   he 's fully capable of walking out of this hospital .   oh my god ... he thinks i 've gone home ... 
he does n't have to be awake to be on his feet . 
you do n't understand .   if dylan falls asleepthen ... 
i want my kid out of here now ! 
do you mind ... 
everything is not fine ! 
he was just here ! 
they are ... it happened in tonight 's quake .   it happened just fifteen minutes ago . you must 've felt it . 
it was an earthquake and it was dark .   i have no idea . 
oh my god ... 
is he all right ? 
like what ? 
does he have to stay here over night ? 
yes .   it 's a story .   a story for a movie .

when do you think it 'll be done ? 
anyway what i was calling about was ... have you seen any of the script by any chance ? 
yeah ... how'd you know ? 
it 's actually been giving me freddy nightmares . 
holding my own .   you know that guy who was calling me all the time ?   he 's started again .   he 's been putting stuff in my mail . 
in what a romantic comedy ? 
i do n't know why you did n't tell me that 's all . 
i 'm fine . 
fred krueger did it . 
i know how chase really died . 
where 's dylan ? !   have you seen him ? 
john .   will you please just look for him around the hospital ?   i 'm gon na go right to the house .   will you help me john ?   please ! 
dylan 's run away from the hospital .   i do n't know whether he 's wandering around or heading for the house .   but i think freddy 's after him .   i know it sounds crazy ! 
john .   it 's heather .   i need help ! 
you really think dylan 's okay ? 
a man or a boy with a deep y'know freddy voice . 
freddy for all i know . 
i 've never mentioned it to him . 
it 's in my family you know .   my grandmother died in an institution ... 
that 's my memory .   and it seemed absolutely real . 
thinking i saw freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy .   and jumping in ... 
i know what he 's doing is bizarre but most of the time he seems so normal so well adjusted .   i just ca n't believe it 's him .   i mean and not something outside influencing him .   or is that how denial works ? 
what ... happened ? 
i want to see for myself . 
i want to see the body . 
i just ca n't . 
i 'm sorry i ca n't . 
no .   i ... listen i ca n't make it in today . 
hi .   this is heather langenkamp . 
no i do n't think that at all .   how is he ? 
no rex is not going to die .   julie you know where the sewing stuff is do n't you ? 
thanks .   just give them the time he called .   they 're keeping a list supposedly .   sorry .   my nerves are so raw these days . 
dunno .   just have this feeling today ... 
yeah julie i 'm sorry .   i just thought ... there was an earthquake i think .   little one but ... 
choice ?   what kind of choice ? 
you know damn well it 's more than that now !   how can we stop him ? 
dylan .   and ...   chase .   my god wes did you know ? 
that was nancy not me ! 
me ?   why me ? 
is n't there anyone that can stop him ? 
then what is he doing ? 
if freddy 's loose i mean in your script where 's he going to go ?   another age ?   another form ? 
you saying freddy 's this ancient thing ? 
like the genie in the bottle . 
captured ?   how ? 
then in this nightmare in progress does this thing have any weaknesses ? 
this is still a script we 're talking about right ? 
what 's that ? 
robert ?   i ... 
of course he is .   freddy 's dead and gone . 
my child ?   no ... but ... 
no not really .   i ... 
i do n't know if it has really .   with the exception of one and three i 've pretty much kept out of it .   i 'm working in television now .   the hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy . 
black 's fine . 
coffee'd be nice . 
uh ... sure ... when ? 
oh hi .   i 'm fine sara .   my god a voice from the past !

ca n't all husbands be perfect and your elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant you had n't kicked his ass out . 
meetin ' him at the gate . that phone call this afternoon was the signal . my deranged mama 's hid the keys to my car . but of course i know exactly where they are . 
seein 's how you 're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss do n't know how you can criticize . 
why ? he 's right in the groove . 
fuck me . 
no way ... get out ! ! ! 
get out . 
you used the toilet now you can go - what i do around here ai n't any of your business that 's for sure . 
well ... yeah - okay .

what 's cao ben ? 
pace your daddy'd love you even if you did n't have no hair at all . 
why honey ? 
thinkin ' a second baby . 
wrong baby . your daddy never committed no murder . musta been you did n't hear grandmama proper . he made some mistakes is all . your daddy ai n't always been so lucky ... we 're almost at the depot honey . sit back a minute . 
course he ai n't never killed nobody . why 'd you say that pace ? 
like you sweetheart . you and your daddy got the same mouth eyes ears and nose . only difference is your color hair is like mine . 
why pace roscoe ripley ai n't you got one cute mouth tonight ? 
nothin' honey .   mama 's just actin ' strange .

i 'm sorry sailor . i just ca n't help it . give me a minute and i 'll quit . 
you hungry ? pace and i ai n't had dinner yet . 
shake hands with your daddy . 
that man 's a black angel sailor . you hook up with him you 'll regret it . if you live to . 
was a massacre . soldiers there murdered old folks women and babies and dumped 'em in a trench . bobby peru prob'ly killed the most . 
buddy told me about that thing at cao ben ? 
he 's the kind liked it . 
that was a accident . i bet both our asses bobby peru done murdered all kinds of people and meant it too . 
he 's a stone fuckin ' criminal honey and you ai n't . 
who says i 'm smart ? you up to somethin' with bobby peru sailor ? 
rather be in el paso than big tuna . 
i mean tomorrow . 
let 's leave here . 
so where 'd you say you was ? 
some ... sparky said red 's promised to have him and buddy out of here by the weekend . 
yeah ... he was lookin ' for you . 
buddy and sparky come by earlier . 
ca n't tell yet . where 'd you go ? 
you been drinkin ' huh ? 
i know . just i 'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin' and this do n't help soothe me . 
really sailor it ai n't nothin' against you . i love you . 
well nothin' personal but i ai n't sure it 's okay by me . 
not that . look at what i wrote down cause i ca n't say it . 
sailor ? you know what ? 
no i do n't think so sail . i just need to lie down . 
darlin ' i still ai n't feelin ' so well . i 'm goin' to bed . 
come sit by me . 
a little i think ... darlin ' ? 
i barfed . tried to make it to the bathroom ... turned out it was the wrong door anyways ... i sorta got it cleaned up . 
you find any work ? 
that you sail honey ? 
i 'm gon na stay here in this room sailor . i do n't feel so good ? this heat makes me tired . 
this ai n't exactly my most thrillin ' notion of startin ' a new life . 
now what ? 
and no ac . 
no radio or tv ... 
not quite as bad as the weather though ... it must be a hundred and ten and it ai n't even noon yet . 
she died right in front of me . why 'd she have to go and do that sailor ? 
i ca n't take this sailor . she 's dyin ' right in front of our eyes ... 
you think she 's gon na make it ? 
sailor what are we gon na do ? 
sailor ! ! ! 
oh god sailor . 
what 's that ? 
i do trust you sailor . like i ai n't never trusted nobody before . 
if you say so . 
well we 're really out in the middle of it now ai n't we ? 
i take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together . 
my mama ...   so sailor our histories have been somewhat intertwined . 
... they was laughin ' arm in arm like animals . 
that night in the fire while my daddy was dyin ' ... i saw mama up in her room with santos ... 
no sailor darlin ' . just shockin ' sometimes when things are n't the way you thought they were ... i been carryin ' a secret too ... 
yeah i 'm here . 
how 'd you know my daddy ? 
that 's some big secret you been carryin ' sailor . 
god sailor ... that 's the night my daddy died . 
oh shit ... 
you knew my daddy ? 
you 're scarin ' me baby . 
i just figured you was out bein ' mr. cool ... 
sure is a big deal round here ... alamo road alamo street alamo square alamo buildin ' alamo alamo . they ai n't forgettin ' about it in a hurry . that 's the thing 'bout memory ? some things you wish you could forget ... what 's troublin ' you sugar ? 
the world 's gettin ' worse i think sailor . and it do n't sound like there 's much we can do about it neither . 
i ca n't take no more of this radio ...   i ai n't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life sailor ripley you find me some dancin ' music right this minute ... i mean it ! ! 
you want me to drive for a stretch ? give you a chance to rest . 
you want to stick around here sailor ? see if we can get some work ? 
how much we got left honey ? 
leave me be for a minute ? mama gets all insane and then i see you practicin ' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil - town tramp . how you figure i 'm gon na feel ? 
it 's me who 's wastin ' time sailor bein ' with you . 
pardon me ? y'all got a phone here i can use ? 
i want to call her and tell her i 'm okay . that we 're okay . 
mama . i been thinkin ' about her . she 's prob'ly worried to death by now . 
you think she 's pretty ? 
well she ai n't talked to nobody and ai n't nobody spoke to her that i could tell . what you make of that ? 
you notice that woman when we come in ? the white woman sittin ' by herself ? 
i 'll be damned if i 'm leavin ' . that band is too good ? 
we 'll find out in a hurry . 
maybe there 's a place we could hear some music . i feel like dancin ' . we could ask someone . 
i would n't mind a little night life . how about you ? 
do me a favor sailor ? do n't pick up no more hitchers okay ? 
i know you 're thinkin ' that i got more'n some of my mama in me ? well i could n't help it . sailor i really could n't . i 'm sorry for that guy but when he pulled that drippin ' hunk of awful - smellin ' meat out of his pocket ? i near barfed . and them poor diseased puppies ! 
sure you wanna do this ? might be a way they could track us . 
he was sittin ' there havin' a beignet at the cafe du monde . do you think he saw us ? 
you think he saw us ? 
never mind where ... get outta here ... i mean it sailor . 
oh my god ... it 's johnnie ... duck down ! ... get goin' ! 
who do ? 
let 's get outta here ... i suddenly got a funny feelin ' about this place . feelin ' all that voodoo ... 
sometimes dreams just do n't mean nothin' ... stuff comes into your mind and you do n't have no control over you know ? anyways dreams ai n't no odder than real life . sometimes not by half . 
oh baby what an idea . i 'd always be happy to see you no matter what . 
boy sweetie this is weird okay . 
what was this one ? 
you think so baby ? does my talkin ' bother you honey ? 
talkin 's good . long as you got the other ? i 'm a big believer in talkin ' case you ai n't noticed . 
i really do think it 's the best night of my life . 
i was hopin ' you would . i know that night by heart . sometimes honey ? i think it 's the best night of my life . 
recall the time we was sittin ' one night behind the confederate soldier ? leanin ' against it . and you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said ' you feel it beatin ' in there lula ? ... get used to it 'cause it belongs to you now . ' d'you recall that ? 
you certain ? 
anythin ' interestin ' in the world come out of somebody 's weird thoughts sailor . you tell me sailor who could come up with shit like we 're seein ' these days ? 
shhhhh ... it 's four o'clock ... that woman 's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin ' ? ... like bein ' ripped apart by a gorilla maybe ... grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one . 
ever imagine what it 'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast ? sometimes i think it would be the biggest thrill ? 
one person thinks he 's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it . 
it 's just another case sailor . 
i love it when your eyes get wild honey . they light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em . oh sailor you 're so aware of what goes on with me ? i mean you pay attention . and i swear you got the sweetest cock . sometimes it 's like it 's talkin ' to me when you 're inside ? like it 's got a voice all it 's own . you get right on me . 
we sure do n't honey ...   get me a mounds ? 
honey we 're goin' to bed now and it 's time to change the subject . 
sailor ripley ! you stop ! you 're makin ' this shit up and i ai n't gon na sit for it ! 
sailor ? you expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose ? 
i got one on me at lake lanier . lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off . felt awful . he was a cute boy though so it was almost worth it . 
yeah it 's a real problem for me sailor you know ? when i went in that drugstore by the restaurant in biloxi ? i saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in . i 'm not big on resistin ' . so what about a leech ? 
say what ? honestly sugar you can talk more shit sometimes ? 
m - i - ss - i - ss - i - pp - i ... you can almost hear that jazz blowin ' up from the big n.o. 
it 's huge . this musta been a grand old place at one time . 
what 's that honey ? 
i h - a - t - e hotel bedspreads . they do n't hardly never get washed and i do n't like the idea of lyin ' on other people 's dirt . 
how about that one ? the host of the old south hotel . 
got anyplace special in mind ? 
that 's disgustin ' . those kinda sentiments should n't be allowed out in public . is this biloxi yet ? 
what kinda trash talk is that ? 
thank the lord . well you ai n't let me down yet sailor . that 's more'n i can say for the rest of the world ? 
manslaughterer honey not murderer . do n't exaggerate . 
yeah i guess but - and here 's the lesson part - they ai n't supposed to be so bad for you . 
it ai n't . it 's part of the lessons of life . i picked me up a pack of vantages before we left the cape ? 
we got through two states already . 
what 'll it be like in california sailor do you think ? i hear it do n't rain much there . 
i suppose so . she knew i was bound to see you soon as you was sprung but i do n't figure she counted on us takin ' off together like this ... i guess this means you 're breakin ' parole then ? 
i 'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere . i mean i do n't want her to worry no more'n necessary . 
poor baby . she do n't know what she missed . what color hair she have ? 
you 're excitin ' me honey . what 'd she do ? 
you mean like pedal pushers ? 
oh baby . what a bad boy you are ! 
what 'd you say to her ? 
sorry baby ... when 's the first time you done it with a girl who was n't hookin ' ? 
you still got plenty energy for me baby . 
... that 's an awful long way to go just to get some pussy . 
i 'd got to the far end of the world for you baby ... you know i would . 
maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much ... 
we got ta be careful honey my mama 's gon na have johnnie farragut on us like a duck on a june bug and he 's one clever detective ? you know how clever ? he once told me that he could find an honest man in washington . my toenails got ta dry first anyways sailor . 
yeah i suppose . but you know somethin' baby hair does make a difference . 
he 's twenty - four now ? a year older than you ? and must be 'bout bald . 
when he was about seventeen he startin ' losin ' his hair . 
too bad we all ca n't baby ... one thing about dell ? 
it ai n't so funny now though . december before christmas ? dell disappeared again and aunt rootie hired a private eye to find him . he was missin ' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin ' dressed in some filthy santa claus suit . 
... are followin ' him around . 
one time - real late - like about two thirty a.m. ? she found dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin ' sandwiches in the kitchen . 
one time aunt rootie caught dell puttin ' one big cockroach on his anus ? 
well like mama told me aunt rootie dell 's mama ? she found cockroaches in dell 's underwear . 
dell disappeared . dell was learnin ' a hard lesson . what i learned from observin ' dell is i think people who are frightened want to disappear . he 'd startin ' behavin ' weird ? like comin ' up to people every fifteen minutes and askin ' how they were doin' ? 
oh nothin' . i never let on to mama about dell bein ' the one . i just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was ? i did n't tell dell neither . he was back home in chattanooga by then anyhow and i did n't see the point . somethin' terrible happened to him though . six months ago . 
it was my cousin dell done it ? his folks used to visit with us summers . 
... i hope you appreciate my spendin ' six hundred dollars not countin ' what it cost us to get here and back ... this man 's the best damn abortionist in the south . 
she got me an abortion ... 
i just think about things as they come up . i never been much of a planner . 
oh you know exactly what i mean honey ? it 'd make the future so simple and nice . 
would n't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives ? 
that do n't seem fair . 
do n't the reject guys get anythin ' ? 
i 'm sorry sweetie . i forget some moments where all you been the last two years . 
what 's that honey ? 
what you have to get personal about so quick ? all i mean is you could possibly read a book . 
what you want to watch this trash for ? ai n't one of those people have a real thought in their brain . 
hell you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all . 
i 'm always ready to dance . but i need me a kiss first honey . just one ? 
that woman 's laugh creeps me out . i heard somethin' like that ... somewhere before ... sound'd like the wicked witch ... 
sailor that ozone layer is disappearin ' . seems to me the government could do somethin' about it . one of these mornings the sun'll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an x - ray . 
uncle pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin ' in myrtle beach . they still got way too much traffic there for my taste ... and another thing baby ... that government of ours should be keepin ' us separated from outer space ... 
one hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a ' 54 ford pick - up and a ' 64 chevy station wagon . no survivors . balls of flame and grinding metal . 
just you . uncle pooch never acted strange or different after . and he never did anything else to me . i always got a nice present from him at christmas like a coat or jewelry ? 
well sure . but he was super - gentle you know ? i mean he raped me and all but i guess there 's all different kinds of rapes . i did n't exactly want him to do it but i suppose once it started it did n't seem all that terrible . it was over pretty quick and after uncle pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there . i stayed in bed till i heard him drive off . then i just went back into the kitchen and finished makin ' my sandwich . 
he was short but powerful . with hairy arms ? anyway he carried me into the maid 's dayroom which nobody used . we did it there on an old bed . 
no he picked me up . 
uncle pooch came in the side door through the porch you know ? where i was makin ' a jelly and banana sandwich ? i remember i had my hair in curlers cause i was goin' that night with vicki and cherry ann the desoto sisters . uncle pooch must have known nobody but me was home cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter . 
well mama was at the busy bee havin' her hair dyed ? and i was alone in the house . 
i said you can be too crude sometimes ? i do n't think i care for it . 
you 're terrible crude sometimes sailor you know ? 
that 's true . uncle pooch was n't really an uncle . he was a business partner of my daddy 's ? and my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that 's for damn sure . his real name was somethin' kind of european like pucinski . but everyone just called him pooch . he came around the house sometimes when daddy was away . i always figured he was sweet on mama so when he cornered me one afternoon i was surprised more'n a little . 
sailor you are somethin' else honey ... when i was fifteen mama told me that pretty soon i 'd be startin ' to think about sex and i should talk to her before i did anything about it . 
grandmama pace had a long smooth white neck . it was like on a statue it was so white ? 
started he could n't remember things ? got real violent ? mama kept tellin ' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin ' the old paint off our house without usin ' a mask ... but i do n't know . seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces . 
you remind me of my daddy you know ? mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies . he had a long nose too like theirs . did i ever tell you how he died ? 
i 'd stand by you sailor ... through anything . 
gee sailor . i 'm sorry honey . i never would have guessed it . 
what brand'd she smoke ? 
well i was thinkin ' about smokin ' actually ... my mama smokes marlboros now used to be she smoked kools ? i stole 'em from her beginnin ' in about sixth grade . when i got old enough to buy my own i bought those . now i 've just about settled on mores as you probably noticed ? they 're longer . 
did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin ' flyin ' in ? ... did you ever think somethin' and then later think you 've said it out loud to someone ? 
hey baby ... 
holy shit ! ! it 's the night of the livin ' fuckin ' dead ! ! ! ! 
i 'll bet . 
mama ... if you get in the way of me and sailor 's happiness i 'll fuckin ' pull your arms out by the roots . 
would n't make any difference . 
really mama i got ta go . 
sailor ai n't a boy no more mama . 
figure we 'll go have supper someplace . maybe get some barbecue out by stateline . sailor always liked that havana brown 's pig pickin ' . 
course i am mama . 
i 'm goin' mama . no way i ca n't go . 
mama sailor 's in deep trouble here . i just ca n't leave him .

i 'm fine mama . i just wanted to tell you not to worry . 
like hell .

you wo n't of missed much . 
i 'll pack my things and meet you downstairs . 
this 'bout the fifth time ? 
let 's head for texas and see if we can pick up the trail . 
johnnie ... that 's the past ... we got ta get on to our future sugar ! 
who ? ... uncle pooch ? ... 
hell no baby ... i wouldn'ta done that without tellin ' you . 
i did honey but that was last night ... let 's just find those two kids before it 's too late . 
johnnie i ca n't tell you honey . is there anyway we can get on the road tonight ? we 've got to find them kids . 
what is it johnnie ?

i wo n't tell you over the phone . i 'm comin ' to n.o. and i 'll tell you then . 
could she be doin' okay johnnie ? she 's tryin ' to prove somethin' to me that 's all . lula ai n't doin' no more'n showin ' off defyin ' me ...   johnnie i 've done somethin' bad ... 
no but my guess is they 're headed west so prob'ly texas . their money must be runnin ' low . i do n't think sailor had much to begin with if any and lula took the six hundred she had saved in the cherokee thrift . 
listen johnnie lula just called me . she knew you were in n.o. so they left the city . 
i 'm stayin ' right here by the phone until you find lula then i 'm comin ' to get her . you call soon 's you got somethin' even if it 's three in the a.m. 
this is the kinda mistake can take a hindu 's lifetime to unfix ... you better get a move on johnnie before that boy got her holdin ' down a memphis streetcorner and shootin ' dope up her arms . 
maybe i was there but i did n't see anythin ' . all i know 's that trash killed a man with his bare hands . hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby ! 
well stop worryin ' about me and start worryin ' about how you 're gon na get that lula back here and away from that murderer . 
oh johnnie farragut ... do n't you trust your very own marietta ? 
you 're just jealous of santos cause he 's sweet on me . 
i 'll hire a hit man if you do n't want to help me stop this thing . i 'll call marcello santos . 
do n't talk down to me johnnie farragut . i know what volition means and that 's why i want sailor ripley off the planet ! he 's pure slime and it 's leakin ' all over my baby . maybe you could push him into makin ' some kinda move and then kill him dead . you 'd only be defendin ' yourself and with his record nobody'd fuss . 
i knew this would happen . soon as that piece of filth got out of pee dee i knew there 'd be trouble . he 's just got some kind of influence over her i ca n't decipher . there 's somethin' wild in lula i do n't know where it comes from . you got ta find 'em johnnie . 
what if i told you not to ? 
what if i asked you not to ? 
do n't mean him . it 's pace concerns me . 
well you be careful with that boy lula . 
got any plans ? 
what time 's sailor 's train get in ? 
you ai n't takin ' pace though . 
you 're comin ' home precious . santos ' gon na drive us to the san antonio airport .

lula ? i love you baby . i just want you to be all right . 
no baby do n't ! can i send you somethin' ? you runnin ' low on money ? i 'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are . 
argentina ! lula you 're outta your mind . now you just tell me where you are and i 'll come for you . i wo n't say nothin' to the police about sailor i promise . he can do what he wants i do n't care . 
did you run into johnnie in new orleans ? lula are you in new orleans ? 
really lula this ai n't right ! 
you in a dance hall or somethin' ? i can hear music behind you . 
are you comin ' back here soon lula ? i need you here . 
why how could i not worry ? not knowin ' what 's happenin ' to you or where you are ? are you with that boy ? 
you know who it was and you know you are n't and i mean are not gon na see him ever ... end of story . 
and jus when my baby 's out on some texas road with a killer . 
oh god ! what does that mean ? 
hell no ! ! ! that 's the last thing we need ... a buncha cops runnin ' around . 
i do n't understand this ... i do n't understand this one bit . he was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby . somethin' bad has happened - i jus know it .

in the head .

i do n't need to explain anymore'n i have ... you know damn well . 
santos why in hell do you insist on playin ' this stupid game ? 
yes ... get rid of him . 
i want you to get rid of sailor . 
what 's with you ? you know what take care of him means . i do n't call santos except for one big reason . 
i want you to take care of sailor so he wo n't ever be able to bother my baby again . 
lula 's gone off with sailor . 
santos ... it is n't . 
that 's not why i called . 
oh do n't worry 'bout that ... 
so maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire ... and you 're gon na get burned baby ... and besides that you 're shit ... d'you think i 'd let my little girl go with shit like you ? ... why you belong right here in one of these toilets . 
well johnnie told me you used to drive for clyde and santos ... 
no ... i just wanted to kiss you good- bye ... you know too much 'bout little lula 's mom ... 
well she wants to fuck you . 
hey sailor boy you wanna fuck lula 's mama ? ... 
... yes you heard me ... do n't ever call back here again . 
there 's no way in hell you can speak to her and ... 
it 's just that you know i was thinking about how in class you 're always telling us ' that writers make choices -- at least the good ones . and do n't get me wrong . i 'm not saying the book is n't really great -- i mean really great -- but at times it 's well very detailed you know with the genealogies of everyone 's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and i do n't know maybe i 'm wrong but it sort of reads in places like well actually like ...   ... you did n't make any choices at all . and i was wondering if it might not be different if maybe when you wrote you were n't always ... under the influence . 
no it 's not that it 's ... 
i uh i did n't finish i ... fell asleep . 
sure . the keys are on the dresser next to ... to your book . 
it beats ' what 's your major ? ' 
i do n't know grady . i just dropped him on a corner . 
i told you sewickly heights . 
who does ? 
crabtree said it sounded like something james would be messed up in . 
at first the police thought he just ran away but this afternoon dr. gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet -- 
he shot the chancellor 's dog did n't he ? the blind one . 
i do n't know -- maybe -- i do n't think so . 
i know i should n't have but there it was just sort of lying out and i could n't resist and -- and -- i suck . 
i thought we were going to talk . last night . 
the one in your office ? it 's the best one for naps . 
his bag . you know that ratty green thing he 's always carrying around . he must 've left it inside . 
james is odd . i know he has an aunt in sewickley heights . i dropped him there once but ...   come to think of it it was n't even his aunt 's house . he said she worked there . or something . i do n't remember . 
some apartment somewhere . but i 've never seen it . 
i would if i knew where i was taking him . 
i just mean i -- i guess emily is n't going to be there when you get home . 
so what are you going to do ? 
and i love the inscription you wrote to me . only i 'm not quite the downy innocent you think i am . 
i 've been re - reading arsonist 's daughter . it 's so beautiful grady . so natural . it 's like all your sentences always existed just waiting around in style heaven or wherever for you to fetch them down . 
james'll know about george sanders . 
ail right . by the way his friend ... ? 
just checking . 
i think so ... what about you ? 
i think maybe we 're missing the point . it seems to me james ' strength as a writer is that he does n't take us by the hand . he treats us like adults . he respects us enough to forget us . that takes ... courage . 
i have n't heard of half of those . 
just a few then . the big ones . 
mr. crabtree was saying how george sanders killed himself only he could n't remember how . 
are you riding with me james ? 
i know but sometimes ... 
did you just make that up ? 
it did n't come up . 
i told walter . 
some times ... 
dozens . it 's very sad . 
and you 're old . 
oh grady . you 're such a putz . 
terry told me about wonder boys . is it true ? did you lose it all ? 
i believe you . did that nice doctor let you out ? or is this you improvising again grady ? 
i said it did n't sound like you . 
he told me . 
and what do you think you might have said ? 
you did n't happen to call the house last night did you grady ? 
it 's within the realm . he takes his souvenirs pretty seriously . and he was just a wee bit prickly this morning . 
this is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education grady . 
are you sure you parked it there ? 
and the jacket ? 
i 'm not very happy with you right now grady . but more importantly walter 's not very happy and he 's gotten the police involved . they seem to think james leer is somehow responsible for all of this . you would n't happen to know where james is would you grady ? 
it seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed . 
i tried to call but apparently there 's something wrong ... 
what 's he doing out there ? 
who 's that sitting in your car ? 
that ... and you . 
no i do n't think you do . and besides ... i have n't decided yet . 
i believe you . i believe you want to be with me . but this is not just about me anymore . 
gee grady that sounded so heartfelt . i do n't know whether to swoon or smirk . 
all right . 
did you pass out again grady ? did you fall somewhere ? 
are you limping ? why are you limping ? 
i 'm kidding . hello ? 
your fingerprints were all over the bedroom . 
did you confess ? 
you heard ? how ? 
walter 's on campus being the good soldier for wordfest . but he 's a basket case . someone stole marilyn 's jacket last night . and poe 's missing too . 
i ca n't believe you hung up on me you dick . 
i love you grady . 
heavy . smells like gunpowder . 
who 's gun is that ? 
no . there 's no way . i mean do n't you think there 's no way ? 
she 'll come back . that 's why i 'm going to ... to not have this baby . 
you love emily . i know that . and you need to stay with her . 
do n't . i know what you 're going to say . 
almost . want to sit up ?   what 's the matter ? 
you had another one did n't you ? you have to see a doctor grady . first thing monday morning . all right ? 
i guess you 're going to have to chew it off then . 
neither do i. 
and ? are you going to tell him ? 
has he asked to see the book yet ? 
my god i wear the same scent as a transvestite . she is a transvestite is n't : she ? 
is that cristaile ? 
so . i guess we just divorce our spouses marry each other and have this baby right ? simple . 
she 's left before ... 
i think walter would find this a little more than surprising . 
i 'm sure . 
i 'm pregnant . 
you go first . 
walter just got it back from the framer today . 
well then . i 'd better show you . terry -- 
that 's funny . i need to talk to you too .   perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room professor tripp . 
i 'm sorry . it 's these goddamned shoes . i do n't know how anyone actually walks in these things . 
i got the message you called . 
professor tripp . 
you want to keep him happy . 
i doubt it darling . 
i doubt i 'd recognize a ' 63 chateau latour if i was sitting on it . 
what does that mean ? 
i 'm not pretty . 
i have friends . 
it 's my bird book . 
see anything interesting ? 
my daddy likes me home before dark . 
i have to go . 
were you watching me ? 
not too far .   are you a bird - watcher too ? 
you should hear the bird . 
something like that . 
it 's a bright sound . 
i ca n't . 
it 's hard to describe . 
their sound is quite musical . 
you 'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you 'll see here . last week i saw a purple martin . and the week before that i saw a solitary vireo . that 's rare . 
when i go bird - watching . it 's why i like coming here . 
they 're extremely aggressive birds . plus their habits are rather filthy . 
i do n't like starlings . 
they 're starlings . 
there 's little chicks !   you want to see ? 
there 's a million birds here . 
what are you looking at ? 
if she 's here tomorrow i 'll fucking kill her . 
have you seen walter ? 
well mary you 're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe . you do know what runs out of a sewer pipe do n't you ? 
yeah mary - kay i think i do . thanks a bunch for the advice . 
why 's that ? 
not when they fly . 
fucking liar . 
you okay ? 
do you want to talk about it ? 
what 's going on ? 
what 's your fucking problem ? 
do what ? 
prove it . 
do n't be scared walter . 
you 're such an asshole . 
everyone needs a plant . this ivy is one tough baby . it 's a cutting from one of mine . 
what 's it look like ? 
guess that makes you pretty special . 
who does n't ? 
just think about it . 
i think it 's a fucking good idea . 
move in with me . 
we should live together . 
neither am i. 
you 're scared . 
not ever . 
are you serious ? 
i love all of them . they 're strong gentle men with families of their own . and if you asked them about what they did to me they 'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you . 
i love my brothers . 
all three -- in chronological order . 
i got poked around ... here and there . 
well most people are stupid .   you want to talk about odds ? one day i 'll tell you how i survived as the youngest in a family of three sons . you wanna talk about odds ? 
what odds ? 
i know . 
and what do you tell yourself now ? 
you really believe that ? 
they seduce you ? 
is it their innocence ? their beauty ? ... 
why young girls walter ? 
my father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave . 
my father took me fishing here when i was a kid . he could name every fish in the lake . and for every fish he named he had a fishing story . i hated fishing but i loved his stories . 
i 'm sorry walter . 
you mean the time you 're locked away ? 
yes ! i want to know . 
what was prison like ? 
you do n't molest little girls anymore do you ? 
hey i 'm not -- 
i told you i 'm not easily shocked . 
twelve years in prison ? 
how young ? 
what did you do to them ? 
how many girls did you molest ? 
you 're not joking . 
molested little girls ? 
so what did you do ? 
the worst ? 
because i like you . 
hey there . 
i sleep like a dead horse . anything else ? 
is that all ? 
did i say something wrong ? 
well walter this is going to sound off - the - wall but i like to sleep with a man after we fuck . 
i thought i 'd stay the night . 
how about in the morning . 
tell me about it . 
since you 've had sex ? 
do you ? 
what 's the problem ? 
no you 're not . 
i did n't say i did n't enjoy it . 
hey that was ... intense . 
not tonight . 
are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex ? 
do n't you think i should know before we have sex ? 
so ... what 's your dark secret ? 
i 'm not easily shocked . 
something happened to you . 
you 're damaged . 
i thought you were just shy but now i think it 's something else . 
yeah they could . 
what about them ? 
i go backpacking a lot . lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two . 
my place faces a truck street . i 've got cracks in every window from the shaking . 
does n't it get noisy ? 
is that a school ? 
you plan to drink both those beers ? 
you should buy several . i 've got shitty light in my place but my plants do n't seem to mind . light 's important but it 's not everything . 
your windows face south . northern light is the purest . but southern light is very good . 
southern light . 
what do you think ? 
you never spoke to me before . 
they 're all assholes . 
you do n't hang out with the other guys . 
you 're quiet at work . 
guess i 'm not like most women . 
what 's weird about that ? 
very weird . 
here 's this nice hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work . i mean who rides the bus anymore ? 
yeah you . 
i 'm talking about you . 
there 's something wrong with this picture . 
it 's fucking freezing out here . 
want a ride ? 
yeah i 'm fucking fantastic . 
will i see you again ? 
ca n't i stay a little longer ? 
i do n't mind . 
do you still want me to sit on your lap ? 
i do n't want to hurt my daddy . 
how do you know ? 
but will he ... ? 
what will happen if i do ? 
i ca n't . 
ms. kramer . 
my daddy lets me sit on his lap . 
they sound like finches . 
do you want me to sit on your lap ? 
i 'm sure . thank you all the same . 
no thank you . 
birds are my friends . that sounds egotistical but they are . birds know i watch them but they do n't mind because they like being watched ... if they know you wo n't hurt them . 
it sounds like you were banished . 
how come ? 
do you have many friends ? 
i will be in three months .   i ca n't wait . i hate being eleven . it has to be the stupidest age in the world . 
i 'm twelve . 
yeah like the bird . 
hello brigman .

i 've been better .   next time it 's your turn okay ? 
hi tough guy .   i guess it worked huh ?

no way !   forget it .   not an option . 
what you growing gills all of a sudden ?   you got it on keep it on .

you noticed . 
yeah .   so sue me . 
not in this thing . 
you did okay back there .   i was fairly impressed . 
you owe me one virgil . 
bud that water 's only a couple degrees above freezing . 
now what ? 
they must 've learned how to control water ... i mean at a molecular level .   they can plasticize it polymerize it ... whatever .   put it under intelligent control . 
it 's trying to communicate . 
he 's got the shakes ? 
you dumb jarhead motherf-- 
look goddamnit if you wo n't do something about it i will . 
we all see what we want to see ... coffey looks and he sees russians he sees hate and fear . bud you have to look with better eyes than that . 
it was a machine but it seems almost alive . like a ... dance of light .   bud you have to trust me ... please .   i do n't think they mean us harm .   i do n't know how i know that it 's just a feeling . 
bud this is me lindsey .   okay ?   you know me better than anybody in the world .   now watch my lips ... i saw these things .   i touched one of them .   and it was n't some clunky steel can like we would build ... it glided .   it was the most beautiful thing i 've ever seen . 
i need you to believe me bud .   look at me .   do i seem stressed out ?   any of the symptoms of pressure sickness any tremors slurred speech ? 
i saw something !   i 'm not going to go back there and say i did n't see it when i did .   i 'm sorry . 
who 's hysterical ?   nobody 's hysterical ! 
bud something really important is happening here . 
i 'm telling you what is there .   you 're just not hearing .   the impulses somehow are n't getting from you ears to your brainpan .   there 's something down there .   something not ... us . 
come on you guys ... look this is the little one right here .   you can see how it 's kind of zigging around . 
yeah ?   well i 'm not . 
i can extend that .   there 's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module .   i 'll have to go outside to tie onto them . 
brace yourself .   we 've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we 're not using . 
thanks .   no i can handle it .   bud ... there wo n't be enough to run the heaters .   in a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker . 
i can get power to this module and sub - bay if i remote these busses .   i 've got ta get past the mains which are a total melt - down . 
cute virgil . 
i do n't know .   i don't know ! 
but what did he see that made him panic ? 
jammer saw something in there something that scared the hell out him-- 
i do n't know what i saw .   okay ?   coffey wants to call it a russian submersible fine .   it 's a russian submersible .   no problem . 
no .   look forget it .   i do n't want to talk about it . 
you 're right bud .   it was just that simple . are n't you clever ?   you should get your own show ... ask dr. bud advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms . 
bud why are you doing this ?   it 's not part of you life any more . 
no i have n't seen him in a few weeks . 
do you always have to call him that ?   the suit ? it makes you sound like such a hick .   his name is michael . 
i have n't worn mine in months . 
what are you still wearing that for ? 
i was worried about the rig .   i 've got over four years invested in this project . 
that must be it . 
not particularly .   jeez look where this is set ! morons . 
you need me .   nobody knows the systems on this rig better than i do .   what is something was to go wrong after the explorer clears off ?   what would have you done ? 
look i did n't come down here to fight . 
not even when it meant something .   is that one night up in flatbed ? 
not for long . 
virgil you wiener !   you never could stand up to fight .   you-- 
you wimp .   i had a lot riding on this .   they bought you ... more like least rented you cheap-- 
my rig .   i designed the damn thing . 
we were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work .   we had over seven thousand feet of hole down for chrissake .   i ca n't believe you let them grab my rig ! 
i was but i managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here .   only here is n't where i left it is it bud ? 
i ca n't believe you let them do this ! 
we should be dead .   we did n't decompress . 
i think they 're from ' you know ' .   some place that has similar conditions ... cold intense pressure .   no light . 
not us .   not human .   get it ?   something non- human but intelligent ... 
you better not say you missed that . 
cat you tie onto this manifold .   there 's some tanks on the other side ; i 'm gon na go check them out . 
could n't stay away .   you running mixture for us ? good .   could n't ask for better . 
you 're right ... i do n't .   i just need to know that this thing is out of here !   you hear me roger ramjet ? 
you 've got some huevos bringing this ... thing ... into my rig !   with everything that 's been going on up in the world you bring a nuclear weapon in here ?   does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic or is it just me ? 
gimme a break !   coffey these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench !   trust me ... they 're not speaking russian . 
that 's 192 warheads ... and how powerful are they ? 
how many are there ? 
copy that . 
copy that continuing forward .   you just want me to get shots of everything right ? 
neutron counter 's not showing very much . 
the magnetometer is pegged .   side - scan is showing a big return but i do n't see anything yet .   are you sure you got the depth right on this ? 
oh ... chamber runs .   uh huh that 's good .   well hey ... you guys know any songs ? 
do n't call me that okay ... i hate that .   alright from now on we watch each other closely for signs of hpns ... 
get comfortable .   the bad news is we got six hours in this can blowing down .   the worse news is it 's gon na take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later . 
just hold your water okay ?   so kirkhill we gon na do this or we gon na talk about it ? 
what kind of luminous things bud ? 
shut up hippy .   bud how you doing ? 
he could n't be that dumb .   the guy 's a trained killer .   bud 's idea of a fight is arm - wrestling one night over laundry duty . 
schoenick ... your lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move ... 
no .   just you and me .   we get some proof then tell them .   hippy look ... if was can prove to coffey it 's not russians maybe he 'll ease off the button a little . 
let 's go for it .   we could get lucky . 
look you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go and he goes right ? 
a non - terrestrial intelligence . 
figured that out for yourself did you ? 
going over the wall .   coming to bearing 065 . everybody stay tight and in sight . 
what 's you depth cab three ? 
deepcore deepcore ... this is cab three on final approach . 
would we see the flash ? 
what kind of light ? 
i know how alone you feel ... alone in all that cold blackness ... but i 'm there in the dark with you bud you 're not alone ... 
bud it 's the pressure .   try to concentrate . concentrate on my voice .   just listen to my voice . 
ensign monk want to know how you feel . 
8500 feet bud .   everything okay ? 
bud according to monk here you just set a record for the deepest suit dive .   bet you did n't think you 'd be doing this when you got up this morning . 
very good .   about one person in twenty just ca n't handle it .   they go buggo .   they 're no way to predict who 's susceptible so stay alert . 
i 'm certainly not going to swim across . 
this one is gorgeous . 
i did n't know one could sleep so well on a yacht . it lulls you ... 
did you sleep well ? 
what ! after giving us such a run around ... 
if i had a man waiting for me for half an hour and whom i had n't seen for a month ... 
but where are you going ? 
maybe you 'd better ask him . 
somebody must live here ! 
there 's no comparison . 
i think you 're very sweet corrado . 
how wonderful ! 
all i said was that it sounds like a good idea . 
well what ? 
at what ? 
sounds like the name of a fish -- merluzzo basiluzzo ... 
what is that one over there called ? 
i deserve it . 
tell me once more . 
good night . tell me that you love me . 
late very late . 
i 'm too sleepy . 
sandro i 'm not coming down . 
you said you wanted to quit working for ettore . 
sandro listen ... try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow . 
no sandro ... we should go . besides we have n't been in touch with anybody . not even with anna 's father . we should have at least sent a wire or telephoned ... let 's be fair he must be feeling awfully lonely . 
did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby ? 
oh sandro ... i want everything you do . but ... 
what are you saying ? 
sandro wait a moment just one moment ... you seem like an entirely different person ... 
no reason why ... 
no sandro ... please ... 
sandro ... what 's the matter ? 
okay . in a few minutes . 
so you wonder why ? 
and you leave me here all alone ... in this hotel room ... 
yes yes yes yes ... right away ... 
but why am i so infatuated with you ? 
so ... oh how i wish that everything were so much simpler ... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes . what size shoe do you wear ? size 9 . that 's a very lovely size . but i 'm sorry i wear size 8 . 
and are you sure you want to marry me ? are you really sure ... that you want to marry ... me ? 
what do i say ? what can i say ? no . at least not yet . i do n't know ... i ca n't even think of it ... at a time like this ... oh but why did you have to ask me ? 
what ! get married ? 
i 'm sure you 'd be able to design some very lovely things . 
and why did you drop them ? 
but just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times ... maybe even just before we left while i was waiting outside your place ... 
yes yes of course . 
nothing nothing   at all . i was just looking for sandro . 
first let the poor thing have something to eat . 
this is claudia anna 's friend ...   you 've never met my husband have you ? 
yes even i had a mother . she was part austrian but she was still my mother . my childhood was like a tennis match ; they bounced me back and forth here and there ... 
oh no not at all . and then you know very well that he 'll forgive you anything ; just as long as you admit to him that you 're a worse driver than he is ... 
you should have told ettore . he always manages to get what he wants . 
did you manage to find good rooms ? 
and here 's sandro .   why do n't you two go upstairs and change ? 
we 've decided to go to montaldo 's place . in fact ettore should already be there . 
what do you want us to do ? i do n't know myself ... but we 'll do something . 
i do n't see why i should mind . 
but you have to   consider all possibilities sandro . 
perhaps she was n't feeling well ... maybe a cramp or something ... 
claudia is n't coming with us . will you please take care of her luggage ? thanks . 
take it easy raimondo . why are you getting so impatient ? 
you know i do n't love anybody . 
now tell the truth are n't you a bit disappointed ? ... but i already told you ... 
raimondo ... do you enjoy fishing underwater ? 
why have we stopped ? 
that was the beginning the night of the conception . that 's why she burnt the sheets . 
for what ? 
should you see a doctor ? 
what do you mean ? 
a few years ago one of the sisters came to me in tears asking for comfort comfort because she was too old to have any children . not that she wanted to but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility . 
say it ! 
how many times have i burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of . 
then tell me . where are your sheets ? 
it made them uncomfortable . and if they did n't sleep well i 'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules . sister where are your sheets ?   do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin ? 
we 're not in the middle ages sister . 
sister marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress sister . is that true ? 
dear jesus ... 
yes of god . 
my dear i do n't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything . 
you 've got to eat something agnes . 
nonsense i 'm your mother now and i want you to eat . 
your mother tells you this ? ... agnes your mother is dead . 
oh my dear child . 
agnes dear heaven is not a place where ... 
that 's not what he meant . 
who tells you these things ? 
who told you this ? 
he loves you the way you are . 
... you need n't worry about being attractive here . 
why does it matter whether you 're fat or not ... 
oh for heaven 's sake . 
one of the other sisters ? 
through someone else ? 
he talked to you himself ? 
agnes it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating . why is this ? agnes   i 've been commanded by god . 
oh do n't do this ! 
she ca n't remember . 
that 's enough . 
then she 's a liar . 
i left it with her and i went for help . 
i wanted her to have it when no - one else was around they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them but it was such a difficult birth there was so much blood and i panicked . 
i did n't hide it . i put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets . 
that 's a lie . 
she did n't want any help . 
the scandal ... 
i do n't know ... too late to stop it . 
oh do n't be ridiculous . 
i did n't guess until it was too late . 
is it because she 's a nun ? 
why do you insist upon pressing ... 
my god but you 're determined . 
has n't she had enough ? 
this is permission to take her apart . 
if you believe this is murder it is the crown attorney you have to talk to not me . and definitely not agnes . 
i 'm concerned about her health . 
why would i lie ? 
who ?   that tun ... that tunnel has n't been used in fifty years . 
that 's crazy . how could she find out about it ? 
then why are you so obsessed with her ? you 're losing sleep over her ?   you 're thinking about her all the time . you 're bent on saving her . why ? 
that 's what you believe she is ?   the sum of her psychological parts ? 
she is an innocent . 
but i want the opportunity to believe . i want the choice to believe . 
you 'll never find the answer for everything god did . 
there as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out . 
a miracle is an event without an explanation . if she 's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail why could n't she split a cell in her womb ? 
do n't be ridiculous . 
stop laughing i do n't say it 's the truth i 'm saying ... 
why must he be anybody ? 
the father ! 
she 's been touched by god yes . 
for agnes . 
one that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect . 
if we want to hire a psychiatrist for agnes . we 'll find our own thank you . 
i 've just met with the bishop . we 're taking you off the case . 
stop this she 'll hurt herself   i 'm not going to allow this . 
then let 's begin . 
may i be present ? 
would it stop you if i did ? 
begin what ? 
listen to her singing . 
yes but goodness has very little to do with it . not all the saints were good in fact some of them were a little crazy . but ... they were still attached to god . agnes has that birth .   no more ... we 're born we live we die . no room for miracles .   oh my dear how i miss the miracles . 
become ?   one is born a saint . 
yes i do . 
there are no saints today . good people yes but extraordinarily good people ... those i 'm afraid we are sorely lacking . 
and saint john would chew tobacco . 
mary magdelen ? 
even christ would partake socially . 
saint ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet .   and of course 
undoubtedly . not the ascetics of course but well saint thomas more ... 
fine thanks ... 
i 'm out of prac ...   ... practice . 
i 'd love one . 
no it reminds me . 
so you left the church because you had freckles ? 
and what has that to do with it ? 
stupid woman ... and that 's all ? 
what have we done to hurt you ?   and do n't deny it i can smell an ex - catholic a mile away . what did we do ?   burn a few heretics sell some indulgences ? that was in the days when the church was a ruling body . we let governments do those things today . so what did we do to you eh ?   you wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you could n't because it was a sin ? 
what the hell has the catholic church got to do with you ? 
who said anything about the catholic church ... 
bullshit yourself ! 
because i am a moral person . 
she 's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone . 
i know you do n't . 
her spiritual health . 
i have n't decided yet . 
we 'll see about that . 
and my permission ? 
because i did n't know ... 
i knew that after the fact . 
oh god if only i 'd known . 
oh dear god . 
i do n't think i care to know . 
she drank too much . that 's what killed her . 
i never saw agnes until she set foot in this convent . my sister ran away from home . we lost touch with her . and when my husband died and i came here she wrote to me and asked me if i would take care of agnes in case anything happened . 
i did n't tell you because i did n't think it was important . 
about what ? 
yes . i do n't remember where agnes was . i was needed in the sick room . 
the twenty third of january . on that night one of our elder nuns passed away . 
oh dear god i should have guessed ... 
the sheets ... 
oh dear god ... 
there 's nothing here . 
oh some time in january . 
all right what do you need . 
what good would it do . no matter what you decide it 's either the ... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin . 
i am ... 
i am not a virgin doctor . i was married for twenty three years two daughters . i even have grandchildren ... surprised ? it might please you to know that i was a failure as a wife and mother . my children wo n't even see me any more that 's their revenge . i think they tell their friends that i 've passed on . and do n't tell me i 'm making up for past mistakes doctor freud . 
? ? ?   
she is not a child . 
i 'm only interested ... 
it 's my affair too . 
catholicism is not on trial here . i want you to deal with agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else ... 
the catholic church ... 
nuns ... you hate nuns . 
you hate us do n't you ? 
god 's victim . that 's her innocence . she belongs to god . 
i saw it . clean through the palm of her hand . do you think hysteria could do that ? 
i know what you 're thinking she 's a hysteric pure and simple . 
but she did n't ... did she . if anyone had seen what i 'd seen she 'd be public property ... newspapermen psychiatrists ridicule . she does n't deserve that . 
it was healed by the following morning and she started eating again ... 
about two years before . 
she stopped eating completely ... 
i was appalled just as you are now . 
shortly after she came to us . 
oh come on you 've talked to her . she does n't even know how babies are born let alone made . 
this convent is locked solid . the only one that has a key is sister marguerite and she would n't let christ in after dark . 
no - one knew about agnes ' pregnancy . no - one . not even agnes . 
that 's absurd ! 
you do n't really believe something like that happened do you ? 
i 've already told you what i thought . 
no ... not in the eyes of the police . 
she did n't !   this is manslaughter not murder . she did n't consciously kill that baby . she 'd lost a lot of blood . she was unconscious by the time we got to her . 
in her case it is n't . she 's had very little schooling . her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died agnes came here to us . she 's never been out there doctor . she 's never seen a movie or a television show . she 's never even read a book . 
because she 's an innocent . she 's a slate that 's has n't been touched except by god . 
from other people !   i believe she is not crazy nor is she lying . 
i believe agnes is different . 
well ... what do you think ?   is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre ... or maybe she 's perfectly sane and just a very good liar . 
and i am not from the middle ages . i know what you are !   i do n't want that mind cut open . 
exactly . i want you do deal with agnes as speedily and as easily as possible . she wo n't hold up under any sort of cross examination . 
look doctor i do n't know how to tell you this politely but i do n't approve of you . not you personally ... 
do n't ask me those questions dear i 'm not the patient . 
yes but that was some ten months ago . i fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial . 
she ca n't even remember the birth . do you think she 'd admit to the conception ? 
believe me i 've done everything possible short of asking agnes . 
obviously there was . 
father martineau but i do n't see him as a candidate . 
yes but i ... 
none as far as i know . 
i have n't a clue . 
we 're examined once a year . her pregnancy fell in between the doctor 's visits . 
she could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to . 
she undressed alone ... she bathed alone . 
no - one . 
two packs a day . 
you must have tons of questions . you may smoke if you want to . just do n't tell any of the sisters . 
you can call me sister . 
i 'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age ... 
i do n't know ... i do n't know ... 
i do n't know . i do n't know what happened mother i woke up ... there was blood on the sheets but i do n't know what happened .   i do n't know what i did wrong i do n't know and i should be punished . 
it 's not my time of month . 
it 's not that ... it 's not that ... 
yes mother . 
they were stained . 
i burnt them . 
it made them holy . 
in the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins . 
yes mother . 
i do n't know . 
i 'm being punished . 
of god . 
no i do n't ... the host is enough . 
i 'm not hungry . 
but she watches ... she listens . 
mommy i 'll get bigger and bigger every day and then i 'll pop but ... but if i stay little it wo n't happen . 
god blew up the hindenburg . he 'll blow me up that 's what she said ... 
no ... i mean ... i mean look at these . i 've got to lose weight i 'm a blimp . 
i ... i am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon i ... i wo n't be able to fit in i ... i wo n't be able to squeeze into heaven . 
christ said it in the bible he said - suffer the little children i want to suffer like a little child . 
that 's because they 're suffering ... suffering is beautiful i want to be beautiful . 
look at the statues they 're thin . 
it 's a sin to be fat . 
no he does n't . he hates fat people . 
i do i have to be attractive to god . 
i 'm a blimp . 
i am there 's too much flesh on me . 
because i 'm getting fat . 
she 'd punish me . 
i ca n't say . 
i tied the cord around her neck ... wrapped her in the bloody sheets ... and stuffed her in the trash can . 
i put her to sleep . 
she ... left me alone with that little thing and i looked at it and i thought this is a mistake . but it 's my mistake not mommy 's . god 's mistake . 
i do n't remember . 
it was dead . 
god !   it was god .   and now i 'll burn in hell because i hate him . 
i hate him . 
for what he made me go through . 
i hate him for what he did to me . 
i hate him ... 
not your fault ... 
stay away from me ... 
it 's bleeding ... i 'm bleeding ... my god it wo n't stop i ca n't get it to stop .   let go of me i wish you were dead . 
from the belltower the day she before she died . 
she 'd seen him too . 
so i could go to him . 
the statue . she had shown it to me the day before . 
she said michael . 
no ... do n't hit me please ... 
go away i do n't want you here . 
they ca n't hear me that 's why .   oh god ... i do n't wanna ... 
of me . oh ... god !   my god ...   water ... it 's all water ... 
i do n't know which one 
i have to throw up ... 
i feel as if i 've eaten glass . 
for me to get sick in . 
a wastepaper basket . 
a crucifix . 
my bed . 
sister marguerite i think . 
someone 's following me . 
i left early because i was n't feeling very well . 
we went to chapel for vespers . 
i hate them . 
fish ...   ... brussel sprouts . 
i ate . 
i 'm afraid . 
she made me promise not to . 
i ca n't tell you that . 
it grew . 
may i open my eyes now ? 
because i was n't worthy . 
because i was afraid . 
it came out of me . 
i had a baby . 
of telling you . 
i 'm frightened . 
because i 'm in trouble . 
to help me . 
doctor livingston . 
as much as mother miriam does ? 
do you really love me or are you just saying that ? 
i 'm not mistake i 'm here are n't i. how can i be a mistake if i 'm really here . god does n't make mistakes you 're a mistake ... 
yes i am . 
no i 'm not . 
no i 'm not . 
i 'm afraid . 
she touches me down there with a cigarette .   please mommy do n't touch me like that any more . i 'll be good   i wo n't be a baby any more . 
and then ... 
her headaches . 
because she says if i do n't watch out i 'll have a baby . 
she says my whole body 's a mistake . 
... take off my clothes and then ... she makes fun of me . 
... makes me ... 
she watches ... she listens . 
she can . 
i ca n't . 
i breathed ! 
i 'm always bad . 
only you think you 're lucky because you did n't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe were n't always nice but that was because of me because i was bad not her . 
answer me !   you never answer me . 
everyone 's unhappy you 're unhappy are n't you ? 
that 's because you keep reminding me . if you go away then i 'll forget . 
i 'm not sick . 
everything ... i do n't have children . 
i was a mistake . 
not my fault . 
i ca n't help it if i 'm stupid . 
if you 're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and did n't want me but that 's not true she was a good woman a saint ... 
a mistake ... it was a mistake ... 
a mistake ... 
from someone who did n't want to have a baby . 
because i do n't want one . 
well i do n't think i 'm old enough and besides i do n't want to have a baby . 
i could never be a mother . 
she 'd get angry . 
no but i can never tell her that . 
an angel when she was having one of her headaches . 
you 'll laugh . 
i do n't know . 
somebody told her . 
she knew what was going to happen to me . that 's why she hid me away . 
i get headaches . mommy did too ... oh but she was n't stupid . she knew things that nobody else knew . 
no . there is nothing else . just being here at night helps me sleep . 
where did you go ? 
oh it 's even more wonderful then . 
i hope not . it 's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head . 
numbers ... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end . 
oh they frighten me i 'm afraid i 'll drop them . they have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid . i was dropped on my head that 's why i do n't understand things . 
no only when she felt like it . she brought me up here last winter and the next day she died . 
she said all of god 's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could . i liked that . 
she was kind to me . she told me i was beautiful . 
i do n't know . 
no ... do you ? 
well i think they come from ... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear . that makes good babies start to grow . and bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there and they start to grow grow till they come out down there . i do n't know where good babies come out . and you ca n't tell the difference ... except bad babies cry a lot ... and they make their fathers go away ... and their mothers get very ill ... die sometimes . 
where do you think babies come from ? 
no questions . 
why do you smoke ? 
why not ? 
would you like some ? 
do you have any children ? 
would you like to be ? 
are you married ? 
what 's your real name ? 
what do you mean ? 
no ... no i do n't want to answer any more questions . 
no ... no i 'm tired of talking i 've been talking for weeks nobody believes me when i tell them anything ... nobody listens to me . 
i do n't understand what you 're talking about ... you want to talk about the baby ... everybody wants to talk about the baby but ... i never saw the baby so i ca n't talk about the baby because ... i do n't believe in the baby . 
do n't you know ? 
i ... i do n't understand . 
from god . 
no they say it came from the waste paper basket ! 
from their heads ... 
what baby ? 
i fell asleep . 
i got sicker . 
i went to my room . 
down ... there . 
something i ate . 
no . i was sick . 
i do n't know . 
i never saw any baby ... i think they made it up . 
you want to talk about the baby do n't you ? 
in the confessional . 
oh yes . 
at least once a week . 
no . but ... when i look into his eyes i can tell . 
oh i know he does . 
oh yes ! 
oh there are so many . 
i love you . 
right now ? 
god !   but there 's nothing to say about god . 
i do n't know . 
let 's talk about something else . 
no i 'm not . 
that was n't me . 
no i do n't . 
h ... how ? 
what did you do ? 
and then ... what did she do ?   agnes what did she do ? 
you saw it all did n't you ? 
she took the baby in her arms ? 
mother miriam was with you was n't she ? 
it was alive was n't it ? 
agnes you wo n't burn in hell . it 's alright to hate him . 
agnes who did this to you ? 
of course you do . who was it ? 
agnes who did you see ? 
he frightened you and he hurt you . it 's not your fault . it 's his fault . tell us who he is so we can find him . stop him from doing this to other women . 
agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of god . he did a terrible thing to you do you understand ? 
agnes ... agnes ... 
are you frightened ? 
so she sent you ? 
how did she know about him ? 
and the passage to the barn ? 
what did she mean ? 
i want you to remember if you can a night last january . the night sister paul died . do you remember . 
agnes can you hear me ? 
that 's good . do you feel well enough to stand ? 
do you remember what just happened ?

would you like to tell me ? 
what made it grow ?   do you know ? 
no not yet agnes very soon but not yet . how did the baby get into you ? 
to be a mother ? 
why were you afraid ? 
did you want it to come out ? 
did you know what was going to come out ? 
how did you have a baby ? 
but it 's easy . it 's just a breath with sound . say it . what kind of trouble ? 
of what ? 
what kind of trouble ?   what kind of trouble agnes ? 
good . would you like to tell me why you 're here ? 
and why am i here ? 
who am i ? 
you 're listening to a chorus of angels . the music surrounds you like a ... warm and comfortable pool of water . and while you 're sleeping you 're going to be able to recall all the things that we want you to remember . and when i count to three and clap my hands you 'll no longer be hypnotised . can you hear me . 
as much as god loves you . 
i really love you . 
oh agnes oh agnes it 's alright it 's alright it 's alright it 's alright i love you .

that you 're a mistake ? 
and that you 're stupid ? 
she tells you you 're ugly ? 
agnes i do n't believe that . tell me . i 'll protect you from her . 
she ca n't hurt you any more . 
she 's dead is n't she ? 
you can tell me . 
agnes . what did your mother do to you ?   if you ca n't answer me just shake your head yes or no . did ... did she hit you ?   did she make you do something you did n't want to ?   did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it ?   did it embarrass you ?   did it ... did it hurt you ?   what did she make you you do ? 
what did you do ? 
what did you do ? 
sometimes yes . 
and you 're unhappy . 
but you 're troubled ... are n't you ? 
agnes i 'm here because i want to help you . 
what the child ? 
... and that you do n't believe you carried a child . 
... that you do n't remember getting pregnant ... 
agnes i do n't believe you know nothing about sex ... 
is that what she said ? 
agnes how did your mother get you ? 
how would that person get one if they did n't want one ? 
like you ? 
if you did want one how 'd you go about getting one ? 
why not ? 
why not ? 
did you ever want to be a mother yourself ? 
agnes did you love your mother ? 
why not ?   mmm ? 
do you believe she really saw them ? 
do you ? 
did your mother see angels often ? 
i promise i wo n't laugh . who told her ? 
how did she know that ? 
what things ? 
you have trouble sleeping ? 
oh no place as wonderful as this . agnes ... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else ? 
it 's like hiding from my mother when i was a little girl . 
what happens if the bell rings and you 're under there ? 
oh i 've got to give up smoking . agnes ... wait a minute ... agnes slow down . 
i do n't understand them either . do you suppose i was dropped on my head ? 
like what ? 
no wonder ... wait ... agnes ... agnes how do you feel about babies ? 
sister paul was in her eighties ?   did she climb up here often ? 
what else did she tell you ? 
you liked sister paul ? 
why should i ? 
do you know a marie ? 
from their mothers and fathers of course . before that i ... i do n't know . 
smoking is an obsession with me . maybe one day i 'll become obsessed with something else then i 'll stop smoking ... do you have any more questions ? 
does it bother you ? 
i 've stopped menstruating 
i ca n't have them any more . 
not at the moment no . 
martha louise livingston . 
just that ... you ask and i 'll answer . 
would you like to ask them ? 
then let 's talk about something else ... 
yes i do   but i want you to ... 
agnes how are babies born ? 
after god ... before the waste - paper basket . 
where 'd it come from before that ? 
is that where they say it came from ... ? 
the baby they made up . 
where did the baby come from ? 
in the middle of all the pain ? 
and then what ? 
and what happened ? 
and what did you do ? 
did it hurt ? 
how were you sick ? 
do you remember the night they said it came ? 
why should they ? 
would you like to talk about it ? 
where do you meet ? 
and you like that ? 
you 've been alone together ? 
he 's told you ? 
do you think he loves you ? 
well do you love ... do you love father martineau ? 
agnes have you ever loved another man ... other than jesus christ ? 
uh huh . 
well who in particular ? 
have you ever loved anyone ? 
second thing that comes to your mind . 
first thing that comes to your mind ? 
anything ... may i sit down ? 
what would you like to talk about . 
has n't anyone ever told you that before ? 
was it sister marguerite ? 
i just heard you . 
you have a lovely voice . 
hello . i 'm doctor livingston . i 've been asked to talk to you . may i ? 
agnes ?   who ?   mother superior ? 
and the sooner she goes to prison the better off she 'll be ? 
no ... no excuse me eve . as quickly as i see fit . 
eve she strangled a baby ! 
are you dictating my position to me ? we 're getting into some sticky legal territories here . 
maybe there 's something that 's not in the report that should be . 
i do n't know . 
something they ... that they overlooked . 
larry there 's got to be something missing . 
tomorrow ... tomorrow i 'll get it by tomorrow . i will . 
i can get you new evidence next week . 
next week . 
i 'll have it . 
oh joe ... joe she did n't kill the baby . 
i 'll have a decision by next week . 
yes that 's because i 'm getting to her . 
all i want is one more week . 
i do n't believe this . i do n't bloody believe this . 
look there are a lot of unanswered questions here . 
what about roger ? he 's free . 
i ... i 'm martha mama . 
mama that was n't marie that was me ! 
marie 's dead mama . 
did you have a good week mama . are they treating you all right ? 
i thought cherry - vanilla was your favourite . 
it 's martha mama .   there you go . 
it 's your favourite ... 
hello mama   ... brought you something . 
uh huh . 
the one up on the third floor ? 
sister anne which was agnes ' room ? 
well that 's a lot of land . you must have help . do you have field hands that help you ? 
how do you survive ? 
i do n't understand . are you expecting me to .. ? 
look father ah ... just because i do n't subscribe to the ... to the beliefs you subscribe to ... 
what business is it of yours .. ? 
who told you this ? 
what does this have to do with .. ? 
why do you call it an investigation ? i never have . 
was n't it ! 
what happened to the baby ? 
agnes what happened to the baby ? 
i doubt that 's what she 'd say . 
before or after you killed the child ? 
you tied the cord around its neck . 
and the baby . 
you hid the wastepaper basket in her room . 
you wanted that child out of the way . 
you went to the room to help with the birth . 
the baby ? 
too late for what ? 
for what ?   an abortion ? 
and you did n't send her to a doctor . 
did you know she was pregnant ? 
was it you ? 
who knew she was pregnant ? 
i have a few more questions to ask her . 
where is she ? 
who was that person mother ?   was it you ? 
because it 's murder we 're talking about . are n't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room . 
oh would you stop lying mother ! 
somebody told her . 
there 's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn . did you know about that ? there 's an answer mother . that 's how she got out . 
that 's what i have to believe ... 
but she is not an enigma mother . everything that agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry . one two three right down the line . 
but what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you wo n't face the fact that she was raped ... or seduced ... or that she did the seducing . 
i thought you did n't believe in miracles today mother ? 
but how did it happen ? 
you 're saying god did it ? 
this is insane . 
well give me a reasonable explanation 
how   ? 
my god you 're as crazy as ... 
who is he ? 
how ?   how ?   she hallucinates stops eating and bleeds spontaneously . is that supposed to convince me she should n't be touched . give me a miracle . 
you think she 's a saint ? 
for the church ? 
one that will ask the questions you want asked . 
you 're what ? 
no ... no ... i said leave her alone . 
of course . 
the hypnotism . do you still disapprove ? 
i 'd like to begin . 
do you think agnes is still attached to god ? 
well you can try ca n't you to be good ? 
do you want to become one ? 
do you think they ever existed ? 
right .   what do you suppose today 's saints are smoking ? 
oh you 've come a long way baby . 
saint peter ? 
hand rolled . 
long thin and filtered . 
do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then ? 
all right ? 
would you like one ?   huh ? 
my sister died in a convent . and it 's her voice i hear .   does my smoking bother you ? 
no because i ... yeah yeah i left the church cause i had freckles . 
i was n't . i was n't . she was the pretty one . she died why not me ?   i never said my morning prayers . and i was ugly i was scrawny i had buck teeth and freckles all over my face do you know what the nun called me sister mary clitus called me polkadot livingston . 
that 's all ?   that 's enough !   she was a beautiful little girl . 
it was n't sex . it was a lot of things but it was n't sex . you know when i was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school you know what the nun said ?   she died because she had n't said her morning prayers . 
you just said ... 
catholic church does n't have a corner on morality ... 
then why did you call the police in the first place mother huh ? 
an unhappy woman ... 
i do n't give a damn about her spiritual health . 
the woman 's health is at stake . 
do n't deny it ! 
i 'd like yours too . 
oh god . 
why did n't you do anything to stop her ? 
why did n't you ?   you knew she was keeping her home from school . you knew she was an alcoholic . 
there is more here than meets the eye is n't there ?   lots of dirty little secrets . 
she molested her ! 
do you know what she did to her ? 
listening to angels ? 
like keeping her home from school ? 
and agnes ' father ? 
no it just makes you doubly responsible does n't it ? 
your niece ! 
you lied to me 
sister paul ? 
when was that ? 
what sheets ? 
what is it ? 
was the child full term ? 
take at look at it . 
do you have a ... a diary or a day book ? 
visitors to the convent . 
do you remember anything unusual happening at the time ? 
when would agnes have conceived the child ? 
innocence . legal innocence . i know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court . 
there 's another choice . 
no you 're shielding her . let her face the world . 
then help her . 
? ? ?    ... virginity right mother ?   poverty chastity and ignorance is what you live by . 
and she has a right to know that there 's a world out there filled with people who do n't believe in god ...   ... and are n't any worse off than you mother . people who 've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once to anybody . and people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy . she has a right to know that . but you and your ... your order and your church have kept her ignorant ... 
... or bullied or what ever you 're doing . who the hell do you think you are ?   you go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child . 
how dare you think i 'm in a position to be pressured ... 
how dare you tell me to run my affairs ! 
i have n't said anything against the the catholic church . 
i hate ignorance and stupidity . 
and i intend to take her away from him . that 's what you 're afraid of is n't it ? 
it 's being doing it for centuries . she 's not unique she 's just another victim . 
not simple no . 
she has it now . 
she had a ... a hole in the palm of her hand !   she could have bled to death . 
why did n't you take her to a doctor ? 
this was before her pregnancy ? 
and what happened ? 
and you were n't shocked ? 
when did you first learn about her ... innocence the way she thinks ? 
well it 's been known to happen in the day too . maybe agnes went to him . 
that possibility never occurred to you ? 
one of the other nuns found out about the baby and ... and wanted to avoid a scandal . 
it 's possible is n't it ? 
that she was unconscious yes !   so someone easily could have come in the room and killed the ... 
and in your eyes ? 
so someone else could have done it . 
if she 's so innocent how come she murdered a child ? 
that 's ridiculous ... 
how could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth ? 
from other nuns ...   yes i ... i 've noticed . 
what 's your opinion ? 
i am not with the inquisition . 
the science of psychiatry . 
well i 'm the doctor . i 'm the one who 's going to decide what is or is not important here . 
why do you think that ? 
look someone gave her the baby . 
why have n't you asked her ? 
and you did n't try to find out who ? 
could there have been anyone else ? 
what 's his name ? 
was there a priest ? 
what man had access to her ? 
who was the father ? 
did n't she have any physical examinations in this time ? 
how did she hide it during the day ? 
is that normal ? 
how did she hide it from the other nuns ? 
who knew about agnes ' pregnancy ? 
i can beat that . 
you were a smoker ? 
... thank you . 
yes ... i ... 
of course . 
and what do you do about it ? 
well it 's nice to know you think we 're clever . 
and you honestly think that 's what she meant ? 
is she ? 
not really but i 'm probably not a toffee maker . how would you do those lines of mine ? 
why selfish ? 
i only enjoy acting for myself . i hate it when other people are let in . 
is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself ? 
i bet you do n't sound like real people . 
what are you ? 
they ought to be . 
but that 's not like a real person at all . 
but the way you did it then sounded so phony . 
the big hammer ? 
what 's that mean ? 
no .   i 'm a walk - on in a fancy dress scene . i just felt like doing those lines . 
i 'm not ... 
thank you . 
i see .   do you like the play ? 
are you pulling my leg ? 
oh it 's the way you talk . 
you 're from liverpool are n't you ? 
i 'm warning you they 'll be back in a minute . 
are you supposed to be here ? 
go away ! you 've spoilt it . 
i knew i could rely on you . 
is it ? is it really ? 
what have you heard ? 
no i do n't he 's only a casual acquaintance . 
i would have said so . 
well yes your nose is . very . 
oh yes . 
oh you do look . 
well you look like him . 
you are . 
oh you are i know you are . 
oh wait a minute do n't tell me you 're ... 
i call myself phoebe . 
it 's a very famous name mr. dewitt . 
miss harrington 's resting mr. dewitt . she asked me to see who it is ... 
you rest . i 'll get it ... 
i do n't care if i never get home . 
with changing and everything a little over an hour . 
i 'll just pick up the broken glass . 
that spilled drink is going to ruin your carper . 
you 're going to hollywood - are n't you ?   from the trunks you 're packing you must be going to stay a long time . 
lots of actresses come from brooklyn . barbara stanwyck susan hayward - of course they 're just movie stars . 
ours was one of the first . erasmus hall . i 'm the president . 
about how you live what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that . you know the eve harrington clubs - that they 've got in most of the girls ' high schools ? 
it was for my report . 
you probably wo n't believe me . 
that 's all . 
i hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed . she must 've forgot something and when she went to get it she left the door open . i sneaked in and hid till she finished . then i just looked around - and pretty soon i was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so i turned them off - and then i guess i fell asleep . 
please do n't have me arrested please ! i did n't steal anything - you can search me ! 
i - i guess i fell asleep . 
miss harrington ... 
i 'm tired . i want to go home . 
exactly .   here . take it to the party instead of me . 
no it 's not .   it 's for this . 
because i do n't want to . 
i do n't think i 'm going . 
i do n't suppose there 's a drink left ... 
i wo n't play tonight .   i could n't . not possibly . i could n't go on ... 
yes addison . 
yes addison . 
no - no - no ... 
that 's not true ! 
i had to get in to meet margo ! i had to say something be somebody make her like me ! 
she was a liar she was a liar ! 
she never proved anything not a thing ! 
what of it ? 
what of it ? 
then if you wo n't get out i 'll have you thrown out . 
... taken it for granted ? that you and i ... 
belong - to you ? that sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama ... 
i ca n't believe my ears ... 
what have you got to do with it ? 
what do you mean by that ? 
addison will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so i can take my nap ! 
champion to champion . 
i still do n't know what you 're getting at . right now i want to take my nap . it 's important that i- 
i never intended you to be . 
i 'm sure you mean something by that addison but i do n't know what ... 
i do n't know what i take you for anything ... 
well say something - anything ! congratulations skol - good work eve ! 
we sat and talked addison . i want a run of the play contract . 
the setting was n't romantic but lloyd was . he woke me up at three in the morning banging on my door - he could n't sleep he told me - he 's left karen he could n't go on with the play or anything else until i promised to marry him ... we sat and talked until it was light . he never went home ... 
we decided the night before last before we came up here ... 
she does n't know . 
addison wo n't it be just perfect ? lloyd and i - there 's no telling how far we can go ... he 'll write great plays for me i 'll make them be great !   you 're the only one i 've told the only one that knows except lloyd and me ... 
you have no right to say such things ! 
i 'm in love with lloyd ! 
it 's nothing of the kind ! lloyd loves me i love him ! 
i did n't mean just the theater . 
addison just a few minutes ago . when i told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything i wanted- 
lloyd and i. 
that 's for tonight . you 're invited . we 're having everyone up after the performance . 
lloyd . i never have any and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up ... 
max is paying for it . he and lloyd had a terrific row but lloyd insisted ... well . can i fix you a drink ? 
why 'd call me a killer ? 
why not ? 
plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night ... 
what time ? 
you know me better than that . 
it 'll be a night to remember . it 'll bring to me everything i 've ever wanted . the end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one ... 
are n't you ? 
stop rehearsing your column ... is n't it strange addison ? i thought i 'd be panic - stricken want to run away or something . instead i ca n't wait for tonight to come . to come and go ... 
just like it . 
what a day - what a heavenly day ... 
i confide in you and rely on you more than anyone i 've ever known ! to say a thing like that now - without any reason - when i need you more than ever ... 
i do n't think that 's funny . 
just like that . 
oddly enough - she did n't say a word about margo . just that she 'll be happy to do what she can to see that i play the part . 
i discussed it very openly . i told her that i had spoken to lloyd - and that he was interested . 
nothing of the kind . karen and i had a nice talk . 
just some coffee . 
you take charge . 
i 'm about to go into the shower i wo n't be able to hear you ... 
yes . the shubert . 
yes . i do . 
that 's right . 
i 'm not enough for a paragraph . 
i 'd love to ! or should i pretend i 'm busy ? 
even if i wanted to - as you say - be less humble blow my own horn ... how would i do it ? i 'm less than nobody . 
even so . one isolated pretty good performance by an understudy . it 'll be forgotten tomorrow . 
i do n't think i 've done anything to sound off about . 
please do . 
it 's not modesty . i just do n't try to kid myself . 
you 're more than kind . but it 's still miss channing 's performance . i 'm just a carbon copy you read when you ca n't find the original ... 
i consider myself lucky they did n't throw things . 
certainly mr. dewitt ... 
find out . 
you hear all kinds of things . 
you think ? 
- and for you . 
when you told me that whatever i became it would be because of you- 
then face it . i have . since that first night - here - in the dressing room . 
you 're always after truth - on the stage . what about off ? 
do n't run away bill . 
so am i. 
is that what you want me to be ? 
you should n't have had any doubts . 
are you proud of me bill ? 
yes . yes it does . 
goodbye mr. sampson . 
of course not . 
i have a suggestion .   there 's really not much time left - i mean you have n't had a minute alone yet and - well i could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket ... if you 'd like . 
every day . 
i read george jean nathan every week . 
so few come back ... 
but hollywood . you must n't stay there . 
i just asked a simple question . 
then why ? why if you 're the best and most successful young director in the theater- 
is it the money ? 
why you have to go out there . 
i just wondered . 
you said forty - seven minutes . you 'll never make it . 
eve . eve harrington . 
that 's the door . 
it 's after one now . you wo n't get home till all hours . 
how long does it take ? 
how 'd you get all the way up here from brooklyn ? 
do n't bother . 
the maid'll fix it in the morning . 
i might . 
erasmus hall . that 's in brooklyn is n't it ? 
i 've heard of them . 
what report ? to whom ? 
probably not . 
what for ? 
you were just looking around ... 
how did you get in here ? 
what are you doing here ? 
who are you ? 
thank you karen . 
but not all of it - not that lloyd and i are going to be married . 
i 'd do much more - for a part that good . 
addison wants me to play it . 
it could have been - fifteen years ago . it 's my part now . 
if you told him so he 'd give me the part . he said he would . 
something most important you can do . 
i wish i could believe that . 
i 'll never get over it . 
i wish i 'd never met him i 'd like him to be dead ... i want my friends back . 
he 's not my friend . you were my friends ... 
- an understudy 's performance . 
some vague promises of a test that 's all - if a particular part should come along one of those things- 
i 'm not crying . 
you 've really got a low opinion of me have n't you ? we 'll i 'll give you some pleasant news . i 've been told off in no uncertain terms all over town . miss channing should be happy to hear that . to know how loyal her friends are - how much more loyal they are than she had a right to expect me to be ... 
no ! i do n't expect you to believe anything . except that the responsibility is mine . and the disgrace . 
in a way . you find yourself trying to say what you mean but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you 're not saying what you mean but what he means- 
you know i 've always considered myself a very clever girl . smart . good head on my shoulders that sort of thing never the wrong word at the wrong time ... but then i 'd never met addison dewitt .   i remember once i had a tooth pulled . they gave me some anaesthetic - i do n't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way . i heard myself saying things i was n't even thinking ... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body and could n't control what i did or said- 
why should n't you ?   please sit down . 
oh but there is- 
i 've got a lot to say . and none of it is easy . 
ca n't we sit down ? just for a minute ... 
i do n't expect you to be pleasant . 
i was wondering whether you 'd come at all .. 
nothing definite yet - it 's just to have lunch . 
we 're having lunch with a movie talent scout . 
mostly relief that i managed to stagger through it at all ... 
may i have your coat ? 
karen ...   ... you wo n't forget will you ? what we talked about before ? 
well - if she 's got to pick on someone i 'd just as soon it was me . 
if i thought i 'd offended her of all people- 
but there must be some reason something i 've done without knowing ... 
i seem to be forever thanking you for something do n't i ? 
you wo n't forget it ? 
then - would you talk to mr. fabian about it ? 
but mr. richards and mr. sampson- 
do you think miss channing would approve ? 
the show must go on . 
i do n't let myself think about it even-   - but i do know the part so well and every bit of the staging there 'd be no need to break in a new girl-   - but suppose i had to go on one night ? to an audience that came to see margo channing . no i could n't possibly ... 
well ... miss channing 's affairs are in such good shape ... there is n't enough to keep me as busy as i should be really - not that i 've ever considered anything that would take me away from her ... but the other day - when i heard mr. fabian tell miss channing that her understudy was going to have a baby and they 'd have to replace her ... 
karen ...   ... is n't it awful i 'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you 've already done . 
mrs. richards . 
there should be a new word for happiness . being here with miss channing has been - i just ca n't say she 's been so wonderful done so much for me- 
some hollywood movie star her plane got in late . 
i 'd like that . 
i 'll be at the old stand tomorrow matinee- 
i think i 'd better . it 's been - well i can hardly find the words to say how it 's been ... 
it could n't possibly interest you . 
if i only knew how ... 
hello miss channing . 
i thought you 'd forgotten about me . 
eve . eve harrington . 
but if i 'd known ... maybe some other time ... i mean looking like this . 
no i 'd be imposing on her i 'd be just another tongue - tied gushing fan ... 
oh no ... 
standing room does n't cost much . i manage . 
oh no . i see the play . 
he 's the best . 
you 're margo channing 's best friend . you and your husband are always with her - and mr. sampson ... what 's he like ? 
i 've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage i could raise- 
i hope you do n't mind my speaking to you ... 
why should you think i would n't be ? 
i was dreadful miss channing believe me - i have no right to be anyone 's understudy much less yours ... 
i hope so mr. richards . good night ... 
farmers were poor in those days that 's what dad was - a farmer . i had to help out . so i quit school and i went to milwaukee . i became a secretary . in a brewery .   when you 're a secretary in a brewery - it 's pretty hard to make believe you 're anything else . everything is beer . it was n't much fun but it helped at home -   and there was a little theater group ... like a drop of rain in the desert . that 's where i met eddie . he was a radio technician . we played ' liliom ' for three performances i was awful - then the war came and we got married . eddie was in the air force - and they sent him to the south pacific . you were with the o.w.i. were n't you mr. richards ?   that 's what ' who 's who ' says ... well with eddie gone my life went back to beer . except for a letter a week . one week eddie wrote he had a leave coming up . i 'd saved my money and vacation time . i went to san francisco to meet him .   eddie was n't there . they forwarded the telegram from milwaukee - the one that came from washington to say that eddie was n't coming at all . that eddie was dead ...   ... so i figured i 'd stay in san francisco . i was alone but could n't go back without eddie . i found a job . and his insurance helped ... and there were theaters in san francisco . and one night margo channing came to play in ' remembrance ' ... and i went to see it . and - well - here i am ... 
i guess it started back home . wisconsin that is . there was just mum and dad - and me . i was the only child and i made believe a lot when i was a kid - i acted out all sorts of things ... what they were is n't important . but somehow acting and make - believe began to fill up my life more and more it got so that i could n't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me ... i 'm talking a lot of gibberish are n't i ? 
well ... it started with the play before this one ... 
there was an item in the times . i like the title . ' footsteps on the ceiling ' . 
i 'd like anything miss channing played ... 
no thank you .   yes . i 've seen every performance . 
how do you do mr. richards . 
... and if you 'd come in the middle i 'd have stopped i could n't have gone on- 
well if you 'd been here to begin with i would n't have dared to read at all ... 
miss channing i ca n't tell you how glad i am that you arrived so late . 
hello miss channing . 
good evening mr. dewitt . 
the hors d'oeuvres are here . is there anything else i can do ? 
of course . 
i 'd like to hear it . 
if you 'd like . 
i 'm sorry i did n't mean to- 
mr. sampson 's birthday . i certainly would n't forget that . you 'd never forgive me .   as a matter of fact i sent him a telegram myself ... 
well i was sure you 'd want to of course being his birthday and you 've been so busy these past few days and last night i meant to tell you before you went out with the richards - and i guess i was asleep when you got home ... 
oh golly . and i forgot to tell you- 
that 's my job .   see you at tea time ... 
right here . 
i 've got it . 
oh come now as though you were an old lady ... i 'm on my way . is there anything more you 've thought of- ? 
i can imagine ... you know all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you wo n't want it yourself ? 
well - what do you think of my elegant new suit ? 
no trouble at all . 
while you 're cleaning up i 'll take this to the wardrobe mistress- 
the curtains . i made them myself . 
you have n't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating ... 
during your second act scene with your father roger ferraday 's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch . he 's been coming closer down every night ... 
i mean the performance . except for you you 'd think he 'd never even directed it - it 's disgraceful the way they change everything around ... 
i must say you can certainly tell mr. sampson 's been gone a month . 
i could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time- 
well - if i 'm not in the way ... 
the four of you must have so much to say to each other - with mr. sampson leaving ... 
san francisco . it was the last week . i went one night ... the most important night in my life - until this one . anyway ... i found myself going the next night - and the next and the next . every performance . then when the show went east - i went east . 
not with you in them . not by mr. richards ... 
well . if i did n't come to see the play i would n't have anywhere else to go . 
please do n't misunderstand me mr. richards . i think that part of miss channing 's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays ... your new play is for miss channing is n't it mr. richards ? 
something simple . a fur coat over a nightgown ... 
i 'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all . 
glory hallelujah . 
he does not exaggerate . i was good . 
hear hear ... 
bill ...   ... where are you going ? to find eve ? 
i - i do n't know bill . just a feeling i do n't know ... 
i would n't want you to marry me just to prove something . 
i wish it were . 
it 's not nonsense . 
the terms are too high . unconditional surrender . 
i admit i may have seen better days but i am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut . 
do n't be condescending . 
well i am . 
it 's obvious you 're not a woman . 
that word again ! i do n't even know what it means ... 
tell that to dr. freud ! along with the rest of it ... 
the playwright does n't make the performance - and it does n't just happen ! and this one did n't - full of fire and music and whatnot it was carefully rehearsed i have no doubt over and over full of those bill sampson touches ! 
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew i 'd be here ... and gives a performance ! out of nowhere - gives a performance ! 
such nonsense what do you all take me for - little nell from the country ? been my understudy for over a week without my knowing carefully hidden no doubt- 
well you need n't . i will not be tolerated . and i will not be plotted against ! 
you 're being terribly tolerant are n't you ? 
i will not calm down ! 
the ex - ship news ' reporter . no body no voice all mind ! 
i 'm nothing but a body with a voice . no mind . 
i mix what i like . 
poor little flower . just dropped her petals and folded her tent ... 
i must have frightened her away . 
the kid . junior . 
and you i take it are the paderewski who plays his concerto on me the piano ?   where is princess fire - and - music ? 
so full of meaning fire and music ! 
you would n't understand .   how was miss caswell ? 
eve ?   how enchanting ...   wherever did you get the idea of having eve read with miss caswell ? 
what 's all over ? 
everybody has a heart - except some people .   of course i 've got bicarb . there 's a box in the pantry . we 'll put your name on it . max fabian . it 'll say there . always . just for you . 
if my guests do not like it here i suggest they accompany you to the nursery where i 'm sure you will all feel more at home . 
you know nothing about feelings natural or unnatural . 
it has n't been laid out we have n't finished with the embalming . as a matter of fact you 're looking at it . the remains of margo channing . sitting up . it is my last wish to be buried sitting up . 
the kid - junior that is - will be right down . unless you 'd like to take her drink up to her ... 
thank you . 
cut ! print it ! what happens in the next reel ? do i get dragged off screaming to the snake pit ? 
what about her teeth ? what about her fangs ? 
- guilty . 
for instance - you ! 
stop calling her a kid ! it so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which i would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges ! 
stage - struck kid ... she 's a young lady - of qualities . and i 'll have you know i 'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities ! studying me as if - as if i were a play or a set of blueprints ! how i walk talk think eat sleep ! 
twenty minutes ! 
i do n't think that 's funny ! 
clyde fitch thought you may not think so was well before my time ! 
so you 've pointed out so often . so many qualities so often . her loyalty efficiency devotion warmth affection - and so young . so young and so fair ... 
she 's a girl of so many rare qualities . 
she 's a girl of so many interests . 
that never stopped you before . 
i had no idea you were even here . 
i thought you were going to be late- 
remind me to tell you about when i looked into the heart of an artichoke . 
do n't let me kill the point . or is n't it a story for grownups ? 
to put me to bed ? take my clothes off hold my head tuck me in turn off the lights tiptoe out ... ? eve would . would n't you eve ? 
this is my house not a theater ! in my house you 're a guest not a director- ! 
happy little housewife ... 
it wo n't play . 
you 're in a beehive pal did n't you know ? we 're all busy little bees full of stings making honey day and night-   - are n't we honey ? 
i love you too . good night darling- 
i 'll check with eve ... 
yeah ... i will . 
she did ... ? 
of course birthday and welcome home ... who 'll i ask ? 
many happy returns of the day ... 
happy birthday darling ... 
bill ... bill it 's your birthday . 
sing it ? 
bill you know how much i do - but over the phone now really that 's kid stuff ... 
a big hurry be quick about it - so good night darling and sleep tight ... 
- in a tin can cellophane or wrapped in a navajo blanket i want you home ... 
when - when are you coming back ? 
that i am ... 
bill ? have i gone crazy bill ? 
call me when you get in ... 
am i going to lose you bill ? am i ? 
i do n't want to be childish i 'd settle for just a few years- 
- you 're a setup for some gorgeous wide - eyed young babe . 
you 're not such a bargain you know conceited and thoughtless and messy- 
do n't get stuck on some glamour puss- 
take care of yourself out there ... 
all the religions in the world rolled into one and we 're gods and goddesses ... is n't it silly suddenly i 've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle ... 
did she tell you about the theater and what it meant ? 
eve . i 'd forgotten they grew that way ... 
byron could n't have said it more graciously ... here we go- 
ca n't keep his eyes off my legs . 
where 's my coat ? 
oh well ...   ... look through the wigs maybe it got caught- 
heaven help me i love a psychotic . 
i 'm a junk yard . 
show me a human and i might have ! 
thank you so much . 
well i certainly think it 's odd he has n't even come up ... 
do n't be dense . the party . 
the only thing i ordered by mistake is the guests .   they 're domestic too and they do n't care what they drink as long as it burns ... where 's bill ? he 's late . 
that french ventriloquist taught you a lot did n't he ? 
you 're not being funny i could get actors for less . what about the food ? 
my back 's open .   did the extra help get here ? 
i 'm sure that 's very flattering birdie and i 'm sure there 's nothing wrong with that ! 
how do you mean that ? 
she thinks only for me ...   ... does n't she ? 
she 's loyal and efficient- 
she works hard . 
why not ? 
an answer . 
you do n't like eve do you ? 
oh - oh . 
behind in your dues ? how much ? 
just because you ca n't even work a zipper . it was very thoughtful eve and i appreciate it- 
when we get home you 're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours . 
you bought the new girdles a size smaller . i can feel it . 
see you home ... 
she too is a great admirer of yours . 
there are some human experiences birdie that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth - rate vaudevillian should understand and respect !   i want to apologize for birdie's- 
i 'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom birdie dear . 
miss coonan ... 
and this is my good friend and companion miss birdie coonan . 
how do you do my dear . 
of course ! 
buy some . 
it was fort sumter they fired on- 
what a pity all that fire and music being turned off ... 
why not ? 
really eve ? why ? 
how are you making out in mr. fabian 's office ?   i do n't want you working the child too hard max - just because you promised . as you see i kept my promise too ... 
terribly sorry i 'm late lunch was long and i could n't find a cab - where 's miss caswell shall we start ? oh hello eve ... 
i had no idea you knew each other . 
thank you eve . i 'd like a martini - very dry . 
some snowy night in front of the fire ... in the meantime while we 're on the subject will you check about the hors d'oeuvres ? the caterer forgot them the varnish was n't dry or something ... 
i would n't like . 
do n't get up . and please stop acting as if i were the queen mother . 
yes i guess you were . it - it was very thoughtful of you eve . 
yes dear . you forgot all about it . 
eve ...   ... by any chance did you place a call from me to bill for midnight california time ? 
it seems i ca n't think of a thing you have n't thought of ... 
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man . 
there 's the script to go back to the guild- 
very becoming . it looks better on you than it did on me . 
do n't bother . mrs. brown'll be along for it in a minute . 
they are lovely . are n't they lovely birdie ? 
well you 've done so much ... what 's new ? 
when he gets too close i 'll spit in his eye . 
well teacher 's away and actors will be actors ... 
you certainly can . especially if you 're me between now and tomorrow morning ... 
performance number one thousand of this one - if i play it that long - will take place in a well - padded booby hatch ... 
what - again ? 
i wo n't be a minute . 
stick around . please . tell you what - we 'll put stanislavsky on his plane you and i then go somewhere and talk . 
no do n't go ... 
did you see it here in new york ? 
there are other plays ... 
of course it is . 
you 'll be there wo n't you . 
very classy stuff lots of technique- 
but not right away ? first the business of fighting them off chin up stout fella ... 
with tears ? 
karen in all the years of our friendship i have never let you go to the ladies ' room alone . but now i must . i am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there ... 
the little witch must have had indians runners out snatching critics out of bars steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up ... well she wo n't get away with it ! nor will addison dewitt and his poison pen ! if equity or my lawyer ca n't or wo n't do anything about it i will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down mr. dewitt 's ugly throat ... 
in this rat race everybody 's guilty till they 're proved innocent ! one of the differences between the theater and civilization ...   ... what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance ! 
do n't give it another thought one of destiny 's many pranks . after all you did n't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank ... 
about what ? 
let 's not fumble for excuses not here and now with my hair down . at best let 's say i 've been oversensitive to ... well to the fact that she 's so young - so feminine and helpless . to so many things i want to be for bill ... funny business a woman 's career . the things you drop on your way up the ladder so you can move faster . you forget you 'll need them again when you go back to being a woman . that 's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman . sooner or later we 've all got to work at it no matter what other careers we 've had or wanted ... and in the last analysis nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is . without that you 're not woman . you 're something with a french provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you 're not a woman ...   ... slow curtain . the end . 
about eve . i 've acted pretty disgracefully toward her too . 
i do n't suppose the heater runs when the motor does n't ? 
is n't that what they always say ? 
those years stretch as the years go on . i 've seen it happen too often . 
bill 's in love with margo channing . he 's fought with her worked with her loved her ... but ten years from now - margo channing will have ceased to exist . and what 's left will be ... what ? 
more than anything in this world i love bill . and i want bill . i want him to want me . but me . not margo channing . and if i ca n't tell they apart - how can he ? 
what about bill ? 
and what is that ? besides something spelled out in light bulbs i mean . besides something called temperament which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice ... infants behave the way i do you know . they carry on and misbehave - they 'd get drunk if they knew how - when they ca n't have what they want . when they feel unwanted and insecure - or unloved . 
so many people - know me . i wish i did . i wish someone would tell be about me ... 
come to think of it i have n't been very pleasant for weeks . for that i 'm truly sorry . more than any two people i know i do n't want you and lloyd to be angry with me ... 
karen .   i have n't been pleasant this weekend . 
i detest cheap sentiment . 
do you want it on ? 
be brave . he 'll come back - with or without gas . 
it seems to me that walking for most people is not very dangerous . 
not many car either not much chance of a lift ... 
any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas ? 
how far to the station ? 
how much time have we ? 
peace and quit is for libraries . 
that little place just two hours form new york . it 's on my list of things - i'll - never - understand . like collecting shrunken indian heads ... 
i 'm so happy you 're happy . 
would you like a drink ? it 's right beside you ... 
i 'm so sorry ... harrington . wo n't you sit down ? 
dear birdie . wo n't you sit down miss worthington ? 
the heave - ho . 
you 've what ? 
they 're nobody 's fans ! they 're juvenile delinquents mental detectives they 're nobody 's audience they never see a play or a movie even - they 're never indoors long enough ! 
autograph fiends ! they 're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes- 
ai n't it the truth ? 
relax kid . it 's only me and my big mouth ... 
it 's the tight girdle that does it . 
i mean really deeply angry ... 
she is a louse . 
... and bill . especially bill . eve did that too . 
lloyd i want you to be big about this ... the world is full of love tonight no woman is safe ... 
yes sir . 
too bad . 
thank you lloyd . godspeed . 
how fortunate that i have an understudy so ready so willing and so able to go on . 
it 's not important whether you do . we are wearing long underwear . 
karen and i just do n't want an accident- 
usually at the point when she 's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater ! 
then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind ? sherwood ? arthur miller ? beaumont and fletcher ? 
perfectly innocent ! man have been hanged for less ! i 'm lied to attacked behind my back accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were holy gospel ! 
not mouse never mouse ! if anything - rat ! 
- in this case apparently as trustworthy as the world almanac ! 
it 's right to the point . also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them ! 
i mean among other things that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty - four - year - old character played by twenty - four - year - old actress ... 
to you too ? 
i 'm sure . 
i 'm sure you underestimate yourself eve . you always do .   you were about to tell me about eve ... 
it seems almost inconceivable that i have n't seen her backstage but with so many people loitering around ... well well . so eve is not working for max after all-   - max you sly puss . 
eve ? eve my understudy ? but i had no idea ... 
... as young as they want you mean . and i 'm not interested in whether thousands of people think i 'm six or six hundred- 
spoken like an author .   lloyd i 'm not twentyish . i am not thirtyish . three months ago i was forty years old . forty . four oh .   that slipped out i had n't quite made up my mind to admit it . now i feel as if i 'd suddenly taken all my clothes off ... 
miss channing is ageless . spoken like a press agent . 
do n't be evasive . 
do n't you think it 's about time it became important ? 
how 's the new one coming ? 
when you do let me in on it . 
you disapprove of me when i 'm like this do n't you ? 
shucks . and my autograph book is at the cleaners . 
who 's left out there ? 
where is she ? 
what is he talking about ? 
... among so many quiet qualities . 
and you pose as a playwright . a situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep ... 
would you really ? how sweet- 
within your time buster . lloyd honey be a playwright with guts . write me one about a nice normal woman who shoots her husband . 
honey chili had a point . you know i can remember plays about women - even from the south - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers ... 
i placed ... ? 
that 's right but i do n't understand- 
call what call ? 
then this will be five . i suppose you think i 'm too drunk to count . 
play it again . 
not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill ! 
i did n't hear you . 
answer my question ! 
are you threatening me with legal action mr. fabian ? 
that 's my max . 
think of your health max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track ... 
she 'd be a great help - read scripts interview people you have to see get rid of the ones you do n't have to ... you 'd be a man of leisure- 
you said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away . to keep her here with nothing to do - i 'd be standing in her way ... and you need her max . 
you get quick action do n't you ? 
give eve harrington job in you office . 
not at all . and you could do me a big favor if you would- 
anything to help you out max . 
i tell you what . why do n't i read with her ? 
when 's the audition ? 
well if she can act she might not be bad . she looks like she might burn down a plantation ... 
miss caswell ?   what ? 
here you are maxie dear . one good burp and you 'll be rid of that miss caswell ... 
i love you max . i really mean it . i love you . come to the pantry . 
poor max . heartburn ?   it 's that miss caswell . i do n't know why she does n't give addison heartburn . 
supposed you dropped dead . what about your inventory ? 
make it bergdorf goodman ... and now everything is on its proper shelf eh max ? done up in little ribbons . i could die right now and nobody'd be confused . how about you max ? 
they can always grab oranges off trees . this you ca n't do in times square ... 
a diamond collar gold sleeves - you know picture people ... 
she 's on her way . with half the men in the joint .   it 's only a fur coat ... 
the bed looks like a dead animal act . which one is sables ? 
i know . she just keeps hearin ' her dead father play the banjo . 
lemme fix you a drink . 
i ai n't dense . and he 's been here twenty minutes . 
late for what ? 
there was nothing he did n't know .   there 's a message from the bartender . does miss channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake ? 
the caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-   voila . 
there 's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers . who 'd you call - the william morris agency ? 
you all put together ? 
i 'll tell you how . like - let 's see - like she was studyin ' you like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints . how you walk talk think eat sleep- 
well ... let 's say she thinks only about you anyway ... 
like an agent with one client . 
night an ' day . 
now you want an argument . 
do you want an argument or an answer ? 
she 's got two things to do - carry clothes an ' press 'em wrong - an ' just let anybody else muscle in ... 
but the wardrobe women have got one . and next to a tenor a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business- 
i have n't got a union . i 'm slave labor . 
adorable . we now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop . 
i could n't get into the girdle in two an ' a half hours ... 
something maybe grew a size bigger . 
kill the people .   got your key ? 
imagine . all this admiration in just one room . 
you do n't have to apologize for me !   i 'm sorry if i hurt your feelings . it 's just my way of talkin ' ... 
if i have n't i 'll find something till you 're normal . 
oh brother . 
oh brother . 
well . i guess a real tight girdle help when you 're playin ' a lunatic . 
the same size ? 
you need new girdles . 
i never played fort sumter . 
bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here- 
what did you expect - live sables ? 
but she just got here ... 
margo does not play a lunatic birdie . 
no thanks birdie . 
congratulations eve . 
she knows enough not to be here . 
a part in a play . you 'd do all that - just for a part in a play . 
over my dead body ... 
i do n't think anything in the world could make me say that . 
you talk just as addison said you did . 
after all you 've said ... do n't you know the part was written for margo ? 
i think i know ... 
give yourself time . do n't worry too much about what people think you 're very young and very talented ...   ... and believe it or not if there 's anything i can do- 
yes you will . you theater people always do . nothing is forever in the theater . love or hate success or failure - whatever it is it 's here it flares up and burns hot - and then it 's gone . 
eve . i - i do n't think you meant to cause unhappiness . but you did . more to yourself perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else ... 
he can help you . 
well . i think you 're painting the picture a little darker than it is really . if nothing else - and do n't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in addison . 
but the raves about your performance- 
tell me . how did your lunch turn out - with the man from hollywood ? 
eve ... do n't cry . 
let 's not get over - dramatic . 
do you expect me to believe that you did n't say any of those things - that they were all addison ? 
- and you felt just like that talking to addison . 
- and easy or not i wo n't believe a word . 
there ca n't be very much- 
i do n't intend to be . 
do n't get up .   and do n't act as if i were the queen mother . 
they certainly do n't waste much time . 
eve . i 've heard the most wonderful things about your performance- 
do n't bother i can take it up myself ... 
no eve i wo n't forget ... 
eve . i 'm fond of margo too . but i know margo . and every now and then there is nothing i want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants . 
the reason is margo and do n't try to figure it out . einstein could n't . 
you must n't mind margo too much even if i do ... 
i wo n't forget . 
of course . 
they 'll do as they 're told . 
i think she would cheer . 
no dear . margo must go on .   as a matter of fact i see no reason why you should n't be margo 's understudy ... 
do n't worry too much about that . margo just does n't miss performances . if she can walk crawl or roll - she plays . 
... you want to be margo 's new understudy . 
nobody 's done so much eve you 've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the hundred neediest cases ... what is it ? 
lloyd says margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality ...   ... next to that sable my new mink seems like an old bedjacket ...   ... you 've done your share eve . you 've worked wonders with margo ... 
tell me eve - how are things with you ? happy ? 
discouraging is n't it ? women with furs like that where it never gets cold ... 
now who 's show up at this hour ? it 's time people went home - hold that coat up ...   ... whose is it ? 
not just that way . as a friend ... 
good night eve . i hope i see you again soon- 
you 're not going are you ? 
eve ... why do n't you start at the beginning ? 
my husband ... 
not at all .   margo this is eve harrington . 
you look just fine ...   ... by the way . what 's your name ? 
there is n't another like you there could n't be- 
she 's got to meet you- 
i 'm going to take you to margo ... 
you see the play ? you 've seen the play every performance ?   but do n't you find it - i mean apart from everything else - do n't you find it expensive ? 
he 'll agree with you . tell me what do you between the time margo goes in and comes out ? just huddle in that doorway and wait ? 
bill sampson ? he 's - he 's a director . 
to speak to just a playwright 's wife ? i 'm the lowest form of celebrity ... 
not at all . 
why should you be ? after all six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even margo channing enter and leave a theater- 
so there you are . it seemed odd suddenly your not being there ... 
i remember . 
with tears . 
well ... all right . 
lloyd says it 's a publicity release ... 
i ca n't believe eve said those things ! 
i just ca n't believe it . 
this . i ca n't tell you how sorry i am ! 
margo .   margo i want you to know how sorry i am about this ... 
silly is n't it ? you 'd think they 'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm ... 
not to you . not to bill . 
margo . bill is all of eight years younger than you . 
why should he - and why should you ? 
he 's in love with you . 
what about bill ? 
you 're margo . just - margo . 
we 're never deeply angry we just get sore . the way you do . we know you too well ... 
we 've all seemed a little tense lately ... 
it does n't matter . 
i just never think of lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down . 
he always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical- 
none in sight there are n't many along this back road ... 
three or four miles ... 
roughly ten minutes . 
of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet- 
margo nothing you 've ever done has made me as happy as your taking eve in ... 
margo really ... 
i was telling margo and lloyd about how often you 'd seen the play ... 
she 's just outside the door . 
well ... there 's one indoors now . i 've brought her back to see you . 
they 're your fans your audience- 
yes it is ! you 're talented famous wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you even in the wind and rain ... 
it 's just that you get me so mad sometimes ... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about- 
i find these wisecracks increasingly less funny ! ' aged in wood ' happens to be a fine and distinguished play- 
hi .   hello darling- 
then tell me this is n't true ! that your concern for your play and career is one thing - and that poor frightened hysterical girl another - and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career ! 
have you forgotten about eve ? what she is what she 's done ? 
i 'm a human being i 've got some ! 
did miss harrington tell you to call mr. richards ? 
not much . 
nothing much . she apologized . 
i have no possible interest in anything she 'd have to say . 
what are you going to wear ? 
such as ? 
they 'd die without each other . 
margo in the cub room . i could n't be more surprised if she 'd said grant 's tomb . 
the cynicism you refer to i acquired the day i discovered i was different from little boys ! 
on her knees i have no doubt ! very touching very academy - of - dramatic arts ! 
it strikes me that eve 's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious ! 
margo channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise ! 
with gestures of course . 
eve would ask abbott to give her costello . 
it was all so crazy -- the day after the break - in he gave us a speech bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his -- gordon told us not to let jim mccord ruin everything -- don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel he said . you just know that when gordon liddy 's calling someone a bad apple something 's wrong somewhere .   ... it 's all so rotten ... and getting worse ... and all i care about is hugh sloan . his wife was going to leave him if he did n't stand up and do what was right . and he quit . he quit because he saw it and did n't want any part of it . 
--omigod there was so much of it six million came in one two - day period-- six million cash we could n't find enough places to put it . i thought it was all legal i guess i did til after the break - in when i remembered gordon got so much of it . 
there were a group of them -- i think five i do n't know their names . 
the ones who could disburse the money . 
i ca n't be positive that it was used for the break - in but people sure are worried . 
a lot of it was . i just thought it was sort of an all - purpose political fund -- you know for taking fat cats to dinner things like that . 
there are too many people watching me -- they know i know a lot-- 
... no ... never in so many words ... 
one minute but then-- 
i never worked for sloan or stans . 
i 'm relaxed -- light your cigarette . 
all those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff ? 
you 've really got to go . 
then do n't . 
hmm .   you know that 's   really a shitty middle name ! 
well that 's what your friends call you .   i mean ... i feel like i 'm one of your friends now ... and also ... your girlfriend . 
oz it 's okay i know . 
this is n't any better chris . 
this is n't the best way to proposition me . 
what 's that ? 
you 're missing the game for us ? ! 
what about the game ? ! 
... it 's okay you should do whatever makes you happy . 
you ca n't sing at the competition . 
... yeah . 
so we 're gon na be close next year ? 
oh thank god i thought i was the only one . 
yeah .   so wow you 've got it figured out . 
oh yeah .   so what 're you gon na major in ? 
that 's nice .

well ... i needed to find you .   we are gon na have to practice that song . 
stifler told me . 
yeah ?   well you ca n't fake your way through this .   you better practice . 
why are you doing this ? 
give me a break you 're so full of it . 
i saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies . 
oh please .   i asked you because i thought you might actually be worth going with .   but you are just a jock . no wait .   you 're a jerk . 
no i like the car .   by the way though about prom ?   that was like a bad idea .   sorry i invited you . 
i 'm glad you think so . 
yeah me too okay cool . 
okay .   so i had this ... thought and ... this may seem like it 's out of left field and i do n't know if you can but since i 'm not going with anyone -- 
come on !   i wo n't tell . 
what 's your middle name ? 
do i have to ? 
um ... chris -- 
oh ... well that 's okay .   cool . 
well the same things you do .   hang out with friends and stuff you know whatever .   what do you think i do ? 
of course i did n't -- 
okay .   i mean i agree but ... aren't you supposed to be out like trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something ? 
yeah ... so ... you've got this sort of ... bobby mcferrin thing going there . 
not bad chris . 
are you kidding ?   you 've never double- clicked your mouse ? 
well that 's a no .   no wonder you 're not psyched about sex .   you 've never even had one manually ? 
of course he does .   what about you ? have you just never had one with kevin -- or have you never had one period ? 
vicky it 's not a space shuttle launch it 's sex .   so did you do the physics write - up ? 
what the hell are you expecting him to drive to vanderbilt for ?   milk and cookies ? 
yeah but no offense you 're talking about a post - high school long- distance relationship and you and kevin have n't even done it yet . 
yeah right . 
duh .   of course .   naturally i embellished a little bit .   hey did you hear that finch had sex with an older woman ? 
are you kidding ?   no . 
thanks .   it was my idea . 
no comment . 
well it 's up to you .   the big l or the big o. 
well if you want to get her in the sack tell her you love her .   that 's how i was duped . 
do you love her ? 
do you ? 
no you have n't . 
you got it stud . 
ah you 'll get her back soon enough . that 's easy she likes you .   what you need to do is learn to press a girl 's buttons .   you got ta give her what she 's never had . 
jessica can you drive me home ? 
... i 've never tried it . 
i think i 've had one . 
he likes it . 
jessica !   he 'll drive there for me and i 'll drive to ann arbor for him . we 're going to have sex when he 's ready and i 'm ready .   it 's got to be completely perfect .   i want the right place the right time the right moment . 
that 's not why we 're going out .

vanderbilt 's not that far from u of m. 
your little pact .   jessica told me all about it .   way to go kev ! 
i know .   let 's go .   do n't you have something to tell your friends ?

kevin ... you're not your dad .   the two of us we 're not your parents . 
but you do n't love me . 
kevin ?   do you not love me ? 
i think you 're so right kevin .

that 's sick ! 
you never wanna try anything new alvy . 
sometimes i think - sometimes i think i should just live with a woman . 
i do n't know though i feel so guilty because alvy is paying for it so you know so i do feel guilty if i do n't go to bed with him . but if i do go to bed with him it 's like i 'm going against my own feelings . i do n't know i - i ca n't win . 
but the thing is - i mean since our discussions here i feel i have a right to my own feelings . i think you woulda been happy because ... uh uh i really asserted myself . 
and ... i do n't know ... i mean six months ago i - i woulda done it . i woulda done it just to please him . 
constantly ! i 'd say three times a week . like the other night alvy wanted to have sex . 
well i 've been moody and dissatisfied . 
that day in brooklyn was the last day i remember really having a great time .

will it change my life ? 
well she said that i should probably come five times a week . and you know something ? i do n't think i mind analysis at all . the only question is will it change my wife ?

i 'm a monster .   exactly . 
you think this was to hurt you ? !   my god joe .   it is n't about you . 
i wanted you back . 
i told you when we met i never wanted children .   i do n't want kids in my life . we talked about it .   you were n't listening .

cal too ? 
mac ?   mac says it ?   cal ? 
who ?   who ?   who thinks that ? 
not really .   i mean your books have always been pop but this is the shallowest of the bunch .   that 's what all our friends think anyway . 
it 's a shit novel anyway . 
i do n't look my age joe . 
what are you saying ? 
about me ! 
and how fucking dare you cast skye davidson in that part ?   have you any idea how humiliating that is for me ?   i 'm an actress !   it 's about our marriage for fuck 's sake .   everybody knows that ... 
right .   and when was the last time you spoke to her ? 
it is true .   you know how you love joe ? you dedicate a book to someone . 
you want to talk about bullshit ?   lucy called you three times this week .   she 's a fucking mess joe .   your sister is a fucking mess .   she needs you .   i talk to her more than you do .

what else do n't i know about joe ?   let 's get really clear here . 
yeah let 's talk about that .   you seem to be rather an expert .   i do n't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties . 
oh fuck you and fuck monica while you 're at it .   but i guess that 's what i interrupted . 
it was done .   when sophia put the kids to bed america brought otis in the room and closed the door .   it was done .

monica and ryan . 
well the neighborhood is full of dogs and it 's not always otis .

thank you .   this was so unnecessary .   i hope you 've noticed that otis is n't barking as much .   we keep him in at night . 
well so glad you decided to come . 
relax .   you 've done enough . 
you do n't need to do that . 
what are they ? 
i do n't think i ever spent half a day in the beverly center . 
i 'll be right out . 
but i am a possessive fragile neurotic . 
why are you doing this ? 
not nice .   not kind . 
we 're fine .   we 're great .   we 're having a baby and we 're moving to london . 
neither does joe . 
you were n't exactly horrified . 
and cal 's this massive adult ? 
hey let 's sit down .   i bet the rug feels really nice against your skin . 
oh soph joe loves kids .   joe wants kids . joe thinks he needs kids . 
no no not at all ... i mean i 've still got plenty of time .   do n't i ?   i mean i still have a good six years whatever . we could have three kids yet if we wanted .   and i know i 've always said i never wanted kids and i did n't ... but this year i really truly feel ready ... 
what do you mean thank god ? 
let 's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone . 
sophia !   i 'm not even pregnant ! 
and the food sucks i know . 
oh soph ... 
she took our wedding photos for chrissakes .   you do n't trust anyone . 
big time . 
but she really gets to the heart of joe does n't she ?   she 's a genius . 
we 're always in here .   she really gets him does n't she ? 
it 's much more personal in here . 
so where should i put it ? 
she 's such a great photographer . 
is n't this a fabulous picture ? 
in the guest room .   i 've laid out a paint table for them . 
like joe . 
he 's a novelist . 
and here they are ! 
enough about me . 
i ... wait what are you talking about ? 
you 're coming swimming in the pool and in a few minutes you wo n't even remember what it 's about .   you wo n't care who 's in your damn movie . 
things always look much worse in the morning . 
how nice for everybody .   come swimming . the water 's glorious .   you 'll fix it .   you 'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas . 
it 's always not this time .   if you can do it around me you can do it around anyone . 
you can cut around it whatever it is . you always do . 
mac ?   oh there you are .   what are you doing honey ?   no more work .   do n't you feel breezy . 
so they tell me .   not soon enough of course .   how are you sal ?   you look fantastic . it changes your life you know .   a baby . it puts everything in perspective does n't it .   does n't it mac ?   you ca n't be the center of your own world anymore . 
it 's alright is n't it ? 
my god your wardrobe is incredible .   it took me forever to decide .   oh and i found dr. x thank you .   you saved my life . 
just do n't fucking tell her . 
you know sophia .   she 's so damned judgemental .   and she 's so damned ... perfect .   and so fucking ... serene .   just fucking do n't tell her .   because you know mac thinks she 's god .   and i can feel him comparing . 
i 'd love a xanex .   sally please do n't tell sophia that i 'm not breast feeding . 
and the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy .   i 've got a ghastly headache actually . 
i 'm fine .   i 'm fine .   well i 'm a little stressed .   and i 've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby . 
i 'll change back before we leave . 
it sounds hysterical but otis just rubbed up against me and i 'd kind of like to change into something of yours .   you know it could be disaster .   he 's so allergic .   it 's terrifying . 
they can tell from the eyelashes you know ?   he 's got eyelashes yay long .   they must be a foot long .   the older you are when you have a baby the more likely this stuff is to crop up . 
did n't i say ? 
to dander .   otis . 
he 's allergic . 
i 'm not . 
what a fucking day !   we only just got a sitter .   i do n't know her from fucking adam .   she could be a serial killer .   i 'm going to have to call every ten minutes . you have to let me give out the number . 
oh my god the sitter . 
i ca n't think how you gave it all up soph . 
pictures .   they 're always in my tote .   i left my tote in the damn trailer .   but ! he 's mac all over again .   imagine mac shrunk to two - and - a - half feet .   the fact is they probably did n't even need me for this birth . 
dander .   he 's allergic .   otis . 
so this sitter can always reach me .   i 'm still not used to leaving him . 
with a sitter .   we have a sensational sitter .   jonah 's really comfortable with her .   you know a second mom sort of . like part of the family .   amazing with kids . 
do n't you miss it ? 
you think so ! ?   i 've been working out a lot since the baby . and i 've been working .   and that takes it 's toll you know . 
let 's get the kids . 
are you the funniest person i know or what ? 
oh .   do you have any pictures ? 
you should have brought him . 
what is that thing ? 
so where is young jonah ? 
not for a second .   cal can have all that . 
i 'm glad that 's all over for me . 
you look so well clair .   a wraith . 
his image of you is a possessive fragile neurotic . 
ha !   not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel . 
well you were n't fine last summer when you went sylvia plath on me in connecticut . 
you do n't have kids to keep a marriage together sally .   it 's only five months since joe came back . 
his sister does .   big time .   and the new york times says addiction is genetic -- i 'll e - mail you the article . 
i do n't have a drug problem . 
cal knows who he is .   did you notice how happy joe was when the drugs came out tonight ? 
do n't try and change the subject .   oh god it feels great !   he 's just a little narcissistic irresponsible and unreliable . 
he wants playmates .   oh he 's a sweetheart sal you know i love him . but he 's not going to be a good father . he 's just not parenting material . 
honey i 'm not worried about you .   you are going to be a fantastic mom .   not an issue .   i pressed you remember ?   joe on the other hand is a different story . 
well are you sure about this baby thing ? it 's not the ticking clock shit is it ? 
oh honey let 's .

i never put myself in harm 's way . 
i 'm the hired help . 
you have ? 
excuse me ? 
we live next door . 
i 'm so sorry . 
i think it 's great that i made an impression at all you know . 
i know you changed it to a bookstore . and the color of my hair .   but the moment was exactly the same .   the same you know dynamic .   and almost verbatim was n't it ? 
i 'm so glad .   you know i recognize that passage in your book .   the bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre . 
that 's very nice . 
oh yes .   nineteen ... just .   i 'm cold . 
nine ... nine yes ?   nine years just about . 
he has to find non - smoker 's meetings that used to be almost impossible you know ? it 's gotten much better . 
eight years though .   that 's quite an accomplishment . 
it 's really not the same thing .   he was really nicer when he drank . 
ryan 's really angry with me . 
what am i five ? 
i 'm a little in the puke zone . 
i 've never done this before . 
i do n't think so .   i feel .   i feel a bit funny . 
i will treasure this . 
would you sign it for me .   i 'm sure this is inappropriate . 
i 'll be your best friend . 
alright .   please do n't tell ryan i 'm drinking . 
well that 's what ryan thought .   i was more generous actually . 
and ryan works at home . 
the wrong word maybe .   delete that . and you know the dog barks incessantly . 
but you 're very private people .   you know there 's a kind of elitism ... 
i think a lot of this could have been avoided if sally made more of an effort . 
i do n't know why but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating . 
well yes .   yes in fact .   a little on the outside yes .   and there 's been all this friction . 
a little out of my element . 
i 'm a little nervous so ... 
oh yes .   you know ryan 's been sober eight years .   and it 's difficult if i ... you know .   it 's better if i do n't . 
mmm .   it says something about the two of you maybe . 
sally did all this herself ? 
your eames table is incredible .   and the b&b.   i just put that in a client 's home actually but in red . 
something soft . 
please ryan . 
let 's just go home okay ? 
do n't go in ryan . 
all the ugly phone calls ?   we 're not the only people with a tape recorder ryan .   they 've gone to the canyon we should go towards the pch . 
because we 're nice people and because what goes around comes around .   because god help you if something happens to that dog ? 
we have to find the dog ryan . 
i left the gate open and otis got out ! he could get hit by a car ! 
ryan you 've got to come !   you 've got to help me find the dog !   i let their dog out .   we need to find the dog . 
i 'm going to go get my swimsuit .   i do know ryan this is non addictive so you must n't worry .   ryan you 're a great man . 
you need a good review and you 'll be fine .   the whole color of the world will change mark my words . 
there 's only you ryan .   you know what ryan ?   you 're beautiful .   i love you so much ... you need ... 
i think you need to speak for yourself ryan .   but i think you 're really nice people ... 
they 're really nice people ryan . they 're like us ... 
i think you should then .   you should look in on sheila . 
do you want to go home ryan ? 
i love it here .   do n't you love it here ryan ?   i love it here .   and i love tonight .   and i love these people .   and this feels utterly fantastic ryan .   utterly fantastic . 
he always has two or three going ... 
i 'm so sorry . 
i 'm sorry . 
well whoever did this is amazing . 
yes great !   it 's a beautiful house . 
we could hardly say no . 
not as a rule . 
hm .   you think we should ask them for their landscaper ? 
hm .   we should do it again . 
a perfect night . 
oh jesus oh jesus oh jesus . 
oh yeah ? 
oh yeah ... 
are you my big hard hero ? 
are you my big brave boy ?   are you my brave hero ? 
there 's a test you know . 
ya vhol .   what are you a fucking nazi ? 
nice to meet you . 
i know we 're early we 're so early . sorry . 
the infamous dog ? 
and so i always manage to do you see ? like the book / script thing do you see ? 
but i 'm always afraid i 'll say something stupid . 
you manage to throw me off balance .   i adore you . 
yes i know .   i started to say ... i started to say joe that -- 
do n't be silly . 
i do n't know why joe we 've known each other how long ... 
it 's very good .   i understand you won the booker prize . 
i 'm not much of a reader but i do love autobiographies even biographies sometimes .   mostly non - fiction .   did you read the new styron ? 
still .   well .   let 's drop it . 
but i am right yes ?   she 's based on sally . 
oh my god i 'm a huge skye davidson fan . she 's very beautiful . 
congratulations on the deal .   how exciting .   is sally doing sally ?   i mean it 's sally .   the character that 's based on sally .   the character that 's based on sally in the book . 
nothing that ca n't be exchanged . 
we have a gift ? 
i think there are sixteen there . 
you 're going to be a remarkable director a brilliant director . 
when i read your work i felt that you knew me .   women must tell you that .   and this one in particular speaks to me do you know ?   i am genna .   how many women must tell you that .   and the script is wonderful .   wonderful and lean and visual ... 
oh i love that .   i 'm just great .   i 'm so happy to be here . and i apologize for invading you .   and i 'm so happy you asked me to .   i 'm so touched .   i know how private you and sally are . 
who told you that ?   no .   i 'm twenty ...   five . 
are you asking me to marry you ? 
if he were still alive maybe . 
exactly !   so i dug it and i did a lot of research . 
i just did a movie about bob yar i played gittle the jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head and they used shostakovich 's 13th symphony . 
do peter sellers again . 
who does n't know about the infamous composer 's conference of 1948 where zhdanov persecuted the leaders of soviet music - shostakovich prokofieve and myaskovsky . 
not to mention andrew zhdanov ... otis come ! ! 
really ? ? 
thank you . 
no no thanks . 
oh my god .   i 've been so rude .   i 'm skye davidson .   has anyone ever told you you look like peter sellers ? 
and i 'm overwhelmed .   and i want to do it justice .   and i hope we can spend time together .   and i 'm gushing .   it 's my worst quality . 
i 'm in the same room with sally nash .   oh my god .   you 're my icon .   i 've been watching your films since i was a little girl .   like four years ago i followed you all around the beverly center - at least half a day working up the courage to introduce myself . 
i do n't mind ... 
happy anniversary .   thank you for making me a part of it . 
whatever do you remember ?   i 've seen all your movies .   when i was in rehab the second time they would n't even let us see your drug addict movie .   they said you were too real .   i worship you .   and i could n't be more flattered because i know the part i 'm playing in joe 's movie is based on you as a young woman . 
oh my god sorry .   i 'm interrupting . 
because ... because he 's < u > twice</u > the ant that you are .   i could < u > never</u > go through with marrying you .   i 'm -- i 'm an < u > individual</u > and when i get married it 'll be to someone < u > i</u > choose . 
well you 'll never be able to hurt him where he is now .   i miss him already . 
he's ... he 's dead .   you do n't have to look for him anymore .   he was eaten by a praying mantis .

it 's just that -- well i 'm honored that you selected me and everything i just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation ? 
shut up and deal ! 
seven --   -- queen . 
i 'm going to send him a fruit cake every christmas . 
that 's funny -- so am i.   what did you do with the cards ? 
where are you going ? bud who knows ? another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- i 'm on my own . 
mind if i come in ? 
are you sure ? how 's your knee ? 
are you all right ? 
good night mr. baxter . 
no . you know how people talk . so i decided it would be better if we did n't see each other till everything is settled divorce - wise . 
yes .   you walking to the subway ? 
i guess so . 
i never thought he 'd do it . 
i know .   i suppose you heard about mr. sheldrake -- ? 
how 's everything at the apartment ? 
fine . how 's your eye ? 
i do n't ? 
the dishes ? 
you usually eat alone ? 
i see you bought some napkins . 
shall i light the candles ? 
say you 're pretty good with that racquet . 
are we dressing for dinner ? 
yes nurse . 
no thanks . the fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how i found out . 
are you just making that up to make me feel better ? 
that 's terrible . 
in the knee ? 
no i do n't . 
over a girl ? 
you did ? 
i wonder how long it takes to get someone you 're stuck on out of your system ? if they 'd only invent some kind of a pump for that -- 
i really ought to be getting home . my family will be flipping by now . 
some people take some people get took -- and they know they 're getting took -- and there 's nothing they can do about it . 
i know so . he 's a taker . 
you mean to someone like mr. sheldrake . 
yes you are   when i was straightening up the couch you know what i found ? six hairpins a lipstick a pair of false eyelashes and a swizzle stick from the stork club . 
it 's very curious -- i could only find three and a half pair . 
i was washing my stockings so i decided i might as well do your socks . 
are you supposed to ? 
yes . i was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress . 
sure .   what 's that funny smell ? 
i do n't want to talk to him . 
for me ? 
why ca n't i ever fall in love with somebody nice like you ? 
who 'd care ? 
so they 'll shoot me -- like a horse . 
i just want some fresh air . 
would you mind opening the window ? 
who was that ? 
do i have to ? 
i do n't like myself very much anyway . 
why not ? 
as one woman to another -- i 'm sure she 'll understand -- 
i 'm going to write a letter to mrs. sheldrake . 
can i have that pad and the pencil ? 
you really think so ? 
maybe he does love me -- only he does n't have the nerve to tell his wife . 
was he really upset when you told him ? 
oh . i can type up a storm but i ca n't spell . so they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that 's how i met jeff --   oh god i 'm so fouled up . what am i going to do now ? 
so i came to new york and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab . they sent me to secretarial school and i applied for a job with consolidated - but i flunked the typing test -- 
three . the last one was manager of a finance company back home in pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts but he asked me to wait for him -- he 'll be out in 1965 . 
i just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time . bud   how many guys were there ? 
i was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke . his name was george -- he threw me over for a drum majorette . 
that 's me with men . i 've been jinxed from the word go -- first time i was ever kissed was in a cemetery . 
what do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents ? 
i do n't want it . 
why do people have to love people anyway ? 
i think i 'm going to give it all up . 
you do n't have to entertain me . 
i 'm not very good at it . 
that 's right . will you see that mr. sheldrake gets it ? 
open it . 
oh . did you find something here -- an envelope -- ? 
she does n't seem to like you very much . 
he 's a liar . but that 's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- i still love him . 
he does n't give a damn about me . 
thanks for reminding me . 
but they 'll be worried about me -- my brother - in - law may be calling the police -- 
they had to pump it out . 
no -- it 's my stomach . 
as soon as i can walk . 
i mean -- her apartment . 
in his apartment . 
someone from the office . 
i 'll tell her i spent the night with a friend . 
well i have n't figured it out exactly . 
my sister -- she 'll want to know what happened to me . 
no -- i do n't want anything . 
i just want to go brush my teeth -- 
you do n't want me here -- 
where 's my dress ? i have to go home . 
my head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum . what time is it ? 
i 'm so ashamed . why did n't you just let me die ? 
i did n't know -- i had no idea this was your apartment -- 
i 'm sorry mr. baxter . 
i 'm so tired -- dr . dreyfuss here -- drink this . 
i do n't understand -- 
oh yes -- office party -- miss olsen -- 
all right . have a nice christmas . 
your phone . 
i know . i like it this way -- makes me look the way i feel . 
what is it ? 
i think so . 
i 'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me . 
i 'd better get back to my elevator . i do n't want to be fired . 
this is a bad day for me . 
much better . 
of course not . 
no -- i like it . 
nothing .   there are just too many people here . 
i thought so . 
how many of those drinks did you have ? 
why not ?   they seem friendly enough . 
i should n't drink when i 'm driving . 
do n't be too sure . just because i wear a uniform -- that does n't make me a girl scout . 
you should n't . 
i do n't blame you . it was unforgivable . 
in the last six weeks you 've only been in my elevator once -- and then you did n't take your hat off . 
thank you .   i thought you were avoiding me . 
well do n't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix . they may get the wrong idea how you found out .   ' bye . 
how come ? 
sounds good .   how do you know where i live ? 
so i see . 
how is your cold ? 
meet you in the lobby . okay ? 
well -- i could meet you at the theatre -- if that 's all right . 
what time does the show go on ? 
i 'm afraid not . i promised to have a drink with him -- he 's been calling me all week -- 
it used to be serious -- at least i was -- but he was n't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt . 
just tell 'em -- now and then . 
no . like a man . 
i 'm sorry but i ca n't tonight . i 'm meeting somebody . 
you mean tonight ? 
how 'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor ? 
good night . 
fine .   wait . 
i hope everything goes all right . 
the characters you meet . something happens to men in elevators . must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head or something -- boy i could tell you stories -- 
could n't happen to a nicer guy .   you know you 're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator . 
you 're beginning to sound like mr. kirkeby already . 
twenty - seven . 
you should have stayed in bed this morning . 
well to make the figures come out even -- since i have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year . 
that makes me feel just terrible . 
oh i never catch colds . 
say you got a lulu . 
it was making me nervous so i chopped it off .   big mistake huh ? 
morning mr. baxter . 
please -- just let me sleep . 
mr. baxter -- nineteenth floor . 
i do n't know . 
i took sleeping pills . 
dr. dreyfuss . 
sleeping pills . 
goodbye mr. baxter . 
you fool -- you damn fool . 
because i took some sleeping pills . but i 'm all right now -- so let 's go . 
this is my brother - in - law karl matuschka . 
well -- thank you . 
will you excuse me ? 
i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
yes i know . 
i beg your pardon ? miss olsen i 'm miss olsen -- mr. sheldrake 's secretary . 
i 'd spell it out for you -- only i ca n't spell . 
i do n't know . i guess that 's the way it crumbles -- cookie - wise . 
the nerve . 
he would n't . 
ring out the old year ring in the new . ring - a - ding - ding . 
atlantic city ? 
all set for what ? 
of course i 'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- i never took those pills -- i never loved you -- we never even met -- is n't that the way you want it ? 
hello jeff .   yes i 'm all right . 
sure . monday and thursday -- and monday again -- and thursday again -- 
you run along -- i want to fix my face . 
you 'll miss your train jeff . 
a hundred dollars ? i would n't call that cheap . and you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment -- 
okay .   i just thought as long as it was paid for -- 
yeah we better . 
merry christmas . 
how could i be so stupid ? you 'd think i would have learned by now -- when you 're in love with a married man you should n't wear mascara . 
and just think -- right now there 's some lucky girl in the building who 's going to come after me -- 
i was never very good at history . let me see -- there was miss olsen and then there was miss rossi -- no she came before -- it was miss koch who came after miss olsen -- 
funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- i ran into your secretary -- miss olsen . you know -- ring - a - ding - ding ? i laughed so much i like to died . 
yeah -- that 's me . the happy idiot -- a million laughs . 
where are we going jeff ? not back to that leaky boat -- 
i have that date -- remember ? 
you know i do . 
are you sure that 's what you want ? 
let 's get something straight jeff -- i never asked you to leave your wife . 
handle what ? 
okay . i 'm sorry . 
i was n't trying . 
just trust me baby -- we 'll work it out somehow -- 
they got it an a long playing record now - music to string her along by . my wife does n't understand me -- we have n't gotten along for years -- you 're the best thing that ever happened to me -- 
we did n't talk about it -- you did . 
we talked about a lot of things . 
do i. that leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver -- 
not very -- but i 'm going to be there anyway . 
no . i have a date at eight - thirty . 
sorry mr. sheldrake -- i 'm full up . you 'll have to take the next elevator . 
why do you keep calling me jeff ? what do you want from me ? 
for a while there you try kidding yourself that you 're going with an unmarried man . then one day he keeps looking at his watch and asks you if there 's any lipstick showing then rushes off to catch the seven - fourteen to white plains . so you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly -- 
look jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it . happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl . comes september the picnic is over -- goodbye . the kids go back to school the boss goes back to the wife and the girl --   they do n't make these shrimp like they used to . 
let 's not start on that again jeff -- please . i 'm just beginning to get over it . 
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour . 
like old times . same booth same song -- 
six weeks . but who 's counting ? 
yes i know . you want a lock to carry in your wallet ? 
that 's right . 
no jeff . i ca n't stay very long .   can i have a frozen daiquiri ? 
still afraid somebody may see us together ? 
you bet i will . and when i tell him how you treated me he 'll push your face in .   you fink ! 
my shoes . 
say what 's going on here anyway ? 
what 's the matter ? did i do something wrong ? 
good night ? 
not so rough honey . 
i 'm with you lover . 
gee . sort of gives you goose - bumps just to think about it . 
no kidding . 
say this is snugsville . 
i do n't know you at all . bud permit me -- c.c. baxter -- junior executive arthur murray graduate lover . 
still stuck on her huh . 
you got a girl - friend ? 
can i ask you a personal question ? 
poor mickey -- when i think of him all by himself in that jail in havana --   -- want to see his picture ? 
where do we go -- my place or yours ? 
a night like this it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment . 
' twas the night before christmas and all through the house not a creature was stirring -- nothing -- no action -- dullsville !   you married ? 
mickey ? he would n't do nothing like that . he 's a jockey . they caught him doping a horse . 
my husband . he 's in havana -- in jail . 
all i wanted him to do was let mickey out for christmas . 
because as far as i 'm concerned he 's a no good fink . two weeks ago i wrote him a letter -- never even answered me . 
you know that big - shot down in cuba with the crazy beard . 
you like castro ?   i mean -- how do you feel about castro ? bud what is castro ? 
that 's fine . but what are we going to do about grandma and uncle herman and aunt sophie and my two nieces -- 
she 's home -- stuffing a turkey . 
go where ? 
what gives ? 
thursday ? that 's the untouchables -- with bob stack . 
yes ? oh hello -- sure i got home all right -- you owe me forty - five cents . 
you mean you bring other girls up here ? 
like hell you will .   you 'll buy me a cab . 
a hundred and seventy - ninth street -- the bronx . 
i told you -- with my mother . 
you got to watch those things . wives are getting smarter all the time .   take mr. bernheim -- in the claims department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in great neck and the children and the new jaguar -- 
some setup you got here .   a real honest - to - goodness love nest . 
what guy ?   whose apartment is this anyway ? 
first you ca n't wait to get me up here and now -- rush rush rush ! makes a person feel cheap . 
i do n't want to talk any more . 
that 's why i left moved to washington .   when i met eric i was doing day shoots -- products and fashion mostly .   pretty dull .   eric was teaching college and then he got the job with northland oil .   we wanted to stay together so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography ... and here i am . 
how did she .. ? 
my dad was a navy doctor . 
six months . 
sam ?   we have n't seen him . 
somewhere along the pipeline . 
the radio 's on the fritz . 
-- corbett 's a killer . 
i was hoping you had some news -- 
have you talked to eric ? 
my home is here .   with you . 
technology in the wilderness . only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip . 
you 're hurt . 
i 'm staying . 
so what 's the problem ? 
where 's corbett ? 
what 's going on ? 
oh christ sweetheart .   four days !   i thought you were dead or worse . 
that 's my line . 
maybe you should drive him into devil 's cauldron let them decide what to do with him . 
wait a second . 
high - tech in the wilderness . gets me excited too . 
not me .   i 'm equipped . 
winter .   two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed .   which would suit me fine . 
i still ca n't believe i 'm being financed by an oil company . especially when they get a look at these pictures .   technology in the wilderness ; not too pretty .   what 's that ? 
do i want to be with you permanently ?   yes i think i do . but be with what you do and the way you live ?   that i do n't know . c'm on eric until i met you coming back to alaska was totally 
look why get into this again . as long as it 's working let 's leave it alone .   it 's been nice so far .   we 're together -- 
that 's not what i meant . 
i 'll wear it for you .   and i can wear it when we go home .   we wo n't be here forever . 
oh sweetheart .   it 's beautiful ! 
going after killers is n't the same as chasing poachers eric . 
was there any trouble ? 
did you catch corbett ? 
eric leave it alone .   it 's not your business . 
the little creep hates it that eric actually does what the company hired him to do . 
i call it ' the turtle ' as in carrying your home on your back . 
i bet you have n't had lunch . 
great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high - powered hunting rifle . 
be careful -- there 're two of them . 
what are you doing ? 
be right back .   i left my camcorder in the car . 
stop it ! ! why ca n't i have a normal boyfriend ? ? ? why ? get out of here . just a regular boyfriend who does n't go nuts on me ... 
i love you . 
stop treating this like i 'm going away with a man . he 's just going to say those crappy sick complaining angry things to me . i hate this mom -- i hate this . he 's a freak show -- the worst person i ever met . 
what is it you want ? what ? 
leave me be ! why are you doing this ? why are you picking at my sores ... what is it that you want ? ... you want what ? what 's with you ? i hope getting me thinking of everything that 's wrong when all i want is to not do this has some purpose .   what is it mom ? no kidding . 
... moving in the wrong direction ... away from when i even remembered what it was like to have a man to ... anything ... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with for christ 's sake . i was feeling like really bad that dr. bettes is married .   which is probably why i make poor spencer hug me more than he wants to ... like the poor kid does n't have enough problems . he has to make up for his mom not getting any .   oh boy . who needs these thoughts ? 
i do n't know ... it 's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time . without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody . today on the bus there was this adorable couple and i felt myself giving them a dirty look -- i had no idea everything was ... 
i do n't need one 'cause i know what 's really going on here . i have to finish this letter or i 'll go nuts .   this ca n't be right -- con- science . 
i still do n't feel safe leaving spencer with someone . how do you spell it again ? 
i 'm on the last page . how do you spell conscience ? 
it lets a crazy man into our lives . 
there is a seriously goofy man behind this . you are not allowed to block out that fact . 
do you love me ? 
stay out of this ...   doctor ? 
no i did n't .   so why are you h ... 
do n't be silly . how bad ? 
doc ! ! !   so listen you got ta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we 'll ... 
do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves ? 
his home number . 
once the tests come back is there someone i can reach in your office for the results ? 
fucking h.m.o. bastard piece of shit ...   i 'm sorry ...   forgive me . 
no . i asked . they said it 's not covered under my plan . and it 's not necessary anyway . 
emergency room only . 
since forever . 
i 'm a waitress . 
tell me how bad it is . i let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and i know better ...   and i let him talk me into it . he was whining and ...   you do n't need this . give me a second to catch hold . 
not your name ...   what are you telling me your name for ! ! where is he ? 
what ? please ? now ? tell me ? ! 
no ! it 's certainly not . no -- i do n't think so . no . 
you know what ? i ... 
melvin even though it may seem that way now -- you do n't know me all that well ...   i 'm not the answer for you . 
see . it 's four in the morning . a walk sounds a little screwy to me if you do n't mind . 
oh come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you . 
is it a secret what you 're doing here ? 
i was n't asleep ! ! 
what are you doing here ? 
what job ? 
what do you want ? 
what do you want melvin ? 
okay . good - bye . 
go ahead . 
you do n't have to answer everything i say . just listen to me . okay ? 
see . there 's an example . i do n't know whether you 're being cute or crazy now . 
i do n't know whether i 'm being sensible or hard on you . 
i can trust my brain . 
yeah ... well ... 
i do n't care what you did for me . i do n't think i want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself .   you have my number . 
i 'll take a bus . 
it 's your car but i do n't want to hear it . if that means anything . 
i do n't . 
i do n't want to hear that music right now . 
let me see ... ahh gorgeous ! 
to hell with sex . 
i 'll never forget you said it . 
that 's why you brought me ? look at me ! is that really why you brought me ... like i 'm a what and i owe you what ? ! 
sex with simon ? 
tell me even if you 're scared . tell me why you wanted me here . it 's okay . 
that was n't payment . when you first came into breakfast when i saw you -- i thought you were handsome ... then of course you spoke ... so now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed . tell me why did you bring me ? 
here 's the trouble with never . 
have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid ? 
so how are you doing with those pills ? well i hopahopahopa . 
that 's maybe the best compliment of my life . 
i do n't quite get how that 's a compliment for me . 
i am so afraid you 're about to say something awful ... 
and mean it ... 
that 's not compliment melvin ... that 's just trying to sound smart so i feel stupid ... a compliment is something nice about somebody else ... now or never . 
melvin pay me a compliment ... i need one and quick ... you have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings . 
you wanna dance ? 
you promised a nice place -- ca n't you just ...   you have these dry cleaned all the time do n't you ? 
stop asking everyone . 
my son was outside playing soccer . i never saw him playing ball . come on you guys -- take me out for a good time ... take me out dancing . 
no answer ... maybe we should just drive there tomorrow . can i have that one ? 
go ahead simon . your father walked in on you and was yelling and ... really come on . 
hey -- you let him ... 
anybody here who 's interested in what melvin has to say raise their hands . 
i 'm sure simon they did something real off for you to feel this way ... but when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight . maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance . 
thanks melvin . 
let me go in back . you look like you need all the room you can manage . 
it 's okay . no problem . where should we sit ? 
hello ... oh my god who did that to you ? 
oh . okay then -- melvin . good night . 
okay gotcha . what did you think i was going to ask ? 
there 's ... there 's no need to bring anything dressy ... or ... i mean -- i did n't know if we 'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes . 
melvin ... i 'd like to know exactly where we are going . 
are you saying accepting your help obligates me ! ? 
funny i thought it was a strong point . 
melvin i 'd rather not . 
my son . 
i ca n't . i work . 
the stiff one eye ? 
no sir ... 
thank you . 
i also wrote one part ... i wrote i 'm sorry ... i was talking about i was sorry when i got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so i wrote that .   i was sorry for busting you on that ... and i 'm sorry for busting in on you that night ... when i said i was never ... i was sorry and i 'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler ... 
well part of what i said in this entire history of my life which you wo n't read is that somehow you 've done more for my mother my son and me than anyone else ever has ... and that makes you the most important surprising generous person i 've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever . 
what you did changed my life . 
so . anything else ? 
i want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so i can get out of this city . 
getting loud getting loud . 
a thank - you note for what you did for me . 
just how grateful i am . 
i 'm not kidding . 
i 'm not going to sleep with you . i will never ever sleep with you . never . not ever . 
i do n't think i can wait until tomorrow . this needs clearing up . 
but you do have some idea how strange that sounds ? ? ? i 'm worried that you did this because ... 
why did yo do this for me ? 
that 's not why i 'm here ...   ...   though you have no idea what it 's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about spencer ... 
the doctors had your billing address . i 'm sorry about the hour . 
uh udall ? 
no ! ! ! stay away from me ! 
sorry honey ...   i 'll be right there . 
how do you know about my mother ? 
my son is sick okay ? 
what subject ? that i was n't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs ? do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get ? 
are you totally gone ? this is my private home ... 
what are you doing here ? 
you all set here ? 
okay pal ...   i accept the compliment but go easy -- my knees start a - knocking when you turn on the charm full blast . 
and if i had to guess by your eyes . i 'd say you were kind . so so much for eyes . but as long as you bring up age ...   how old are you ? 
oh please ... 
you know he 's a little dog . next time if bryan 's not here you can bring him in . 
you 're not worried that someone might take him ? 
so what are you doing with a dog ? 
an ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five six times a month where i get whatever nine - year - old they just made a doctor . nice chatting with you . 
he 's got ta fight to breathe . his asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he 's allergic to dust and this is new york and his immune system bails on him when there 's trouble so an ear infection ...   is this bothering you ? 
what do you care ? 
what 's with the plastic picnic ware ? why not try ours ...   afraid it is n't clean ? 
you 're gon na die soon with that diet you know that ? 
it 's not your table . it 's the place 's table . behave . this once you can sit at someone else 's station . 
i know . he 's just the best . 
will you please take it ? 
do n't want to . i love you . 
one night with me ! 
but what about ... 
we held each other . it was better than sex . what i need he gave me great . 
all right cut me a break . 
thanks . but i just want to take a bath and ... 
stop staring . do a vase . 
no ... absolutely not . i 'm shyer than you think . i give the wrong impression sometimes and ... 
good night . 
can you believe in our little mix you 're the good roommate . 
why ? what have you been thinking about ? 
i 'm sorry ... are you okay ? 
i 'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal . 
i do n't think so . you need help with the pants ? 
our room . i do n't want to see him and he 's not going to come knocking on your door . 
what a nice compliment . 
i do n't blame you ... this is a monumental first day out ... you sad or anything ? 
no let me pull over so i can pay full attention . 
yes . i really would . 
i do n't know the last time i 've been out of the city ... hey my arms are tanning . i used to tan great . we got ta stop soon so'se i can check on spencer . 
they 're considerable . but mr. udall wants to be billed . 
water ...   nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in spencer 's room ? 
me . my home number is on this card . 
no . actually i think that 's their technical name . 
it 's amazing these things were n't done . 
they have n't done the standard scratch test . where they make small injections into the skin ? 
have they done skin testing for allergies ? 
only in the emergency room or when he was well . 
have they done blood tests on him ? 
how long has he been having problems ? 
my wife is melvin udall 's publisher .   she says i have to take great care of this guy because you 're urgently needed back at work . what work do you do ? 
he 's in the bathroom ...   he 's fine . 
mrs. connelly . i 'm martin bettes ...   dr. bettes . 
oh god .   i see it ! 
was nice . 
i know .   that 's why i 'm attracted to you .   i mean you make me nervous . you 're intimidating .   maybe it 's my curiosity / self - preservation thing but all i can really think about right now is kissing you . 
that does n't sound normal . 
maybe you should see a psychiatrist . 
uh - huh . 
when did it start ? 
were you attracted to me right away ? 
is this becoming complicated ? 
was she the only one ? 
did you -- 
what happened to her ? 
who was she ? 
it happened to you before ? 
attraction is a complication ? 
is that why you did n't want to talk about women before ? 
is it a physical thing or a mental thing ? 
are you attracted to me ? 
am i attractive ? 
can i ask you something ? 
i 'm playing white remember .   you ca n't tell me which pieces to move . it does n't work that way . 
he believed it all went back to one night when as a little girl .   i watched my parents have this big fight really big .   i thought my mother was going to kill my father . then they went into their room and made up .   and i watched them make love through the keyhole . 
he told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self - preservation . 
so i could watch the girl that lived under me . 
i do n't know .   when i was in college i was forced to go to a psychiatrist because i was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor . 
i know .   it makes me crazy . 
is n't it interesting though ?   i mean look at us in this room .   or yesterday when we were walking in the plaza market .   i mean we look like just another couple .   but what are we ?   does n't it seem so crazy ? 
she is married but not to him . another man much older .   she has four kids .   the young guy works for her .   and i think she likes kinky sex . 
i heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them .   i wanted to so i did . 
nobody ever sees me . 
it was no big deal .   i saw them leave i went in . 
i went into their room this afternoon . 
when i first saw them i thought they were married . 
did you think they were newlyweds ? 
i hate bishops .   they 're useless .   i like knights . 
i think i got one today . 
do you have ulcers ? 
ten years later here you are again . 
you did n't take it . 
was that it ? 
what did he want ? 
what happened ? 
ten years ago . 
i do n't believe that . 
what is it ?   i do n't like this at all .   what is going on here ? 
you killed him here ?   in this city outside that bank ? 
for nicholai ? 
you ca n't know for sure how can you ?   i mean you 're not him . 
except if he does n't come out of the hotel . 
sounds pretty well figured out . 
we split the money ? 
you 'll have the money .   how do i know that you wo n't -- 
and with the mikes i 'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you 'll tell me when he leaves the bank . 
that means you wo n't have a gun . 
what ?   what if he brings it with him ? 
why wo n't he wait until the bank closes ? 
aiiee .   more waiting ?   i do n't know if i like this plan . 
okay .   then what ? 
but he wo n't shoot you right then ? 
they saw you coming a mile away .   if i had known we 'd be using -- 
cheap as shit . 
two way ? 
i 've always wanted to learn something like that . 
not that i would know but you look like you 're really good at it . 
where did you learn it ? 
the beach ?   it was nice . 
book .   sunglasses .   great . 
i know what you are thinking .   i 'm not going to disappear okay ?   i 'm not going anywhere just down there to that beautiful beach .   i got to get out of this room just for a little while . 
why do n't you bring it out here ? it 's beautiful out here . 
what do you think he 's doing ? 
in costa blanca . 
do you think he 's here ? 
i 'm kind of tired .   i think i 'd like to try and get some sleep . 
that sounds nice . 
what will you do if this works if we get the money ? 
what happens if you do ? 
not even a stalemate ? 
but you 've never figured out a way to win . 
do you think about the game ? 
oh .   what do you think about ? 
why not ? 
you were there ? 
i 've never been to the gulf of mexico .   is it as nice as they say ? 
hey where are you ? 
where is it ? 
you said you did n't trust it . 
no .   something honest . 
does that mean it did n't bother you ? 
that 's fiction . 
did it ever bother you ? 
after that ? 
are they usually like that ? 
because i want to know . 
tell me about the first time . 
then you went freelance ? 
they tried to kill you ? 
why did you leave the agency ? 
why not ? 
the exotic women . 
but you knew what they were training you for ? 
they did n't give you a choice did they ? 
you went from high school to the agency ? 
why not ? 
you were like a boy genius ? 
jesus -- why ? 
how old were you ? 
the c.i.a. ? 
how did you get into the business ? 
where you wanted to be ? 
he was killed . 
why did n't you finish this game ? 
it looks like white 's game . 
better than playing with yourself . 
with computers . 
this is crazy .   i ca n't trust you . you ca n't trust me .   how can we possibly help each other ? 
if bain had n't taken the contract on me would you have ? 
what i 'm trying to say is that -- i 'm not sure i can do this help you unless i know more about you . 
no .   just electra . 
listen -- i do n't even know your name . 
oh jesus jesus ... 
you do n't know that -- you 're trying to scare me . 
then you can have the disks and i 'll just walk out that door -- 
i do n't need the money . 
i do n't need you to get the money -- my money ! 
i 'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you 've got two seconds to tell me why i should n't shoot you . 
do n't tell me i do n't have a choice ! 
forget it ! 
and you want to use me to get him ? 
he wants to kill you ? 
so this is something between you and him ? 
someone hired both of you ? 
who is that other guy ? 
what does that mean ? 
an assassin ? 
you 're one of them are n't you ? 
you did n't know anything about me . 
okay .   how did you find me ? 
you want me to pump ? 
now what ? 
ten million -- 
what do you mean ' that 's all ' ? what in the hell do you know ? 
you 're one of them are n't you ?   a fucking pro . 
who the fuck are you ?   who do you work for ? 
what ?   how did you know i had a cat ? 
where are we going ? 
um five . 
a pleasure doing business with you . 
i 'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus . 
right .   in my hands i have five back - up disks he made of all of his work last night . 
i thought it was interesting -- 
i was n't watching television . 
landon honey . there 's nothing more . 
landon . you have two parents . we 're both here for you even -- 
he wants to talk to you . 
be yourself and i do n't think there is a wrong thing .   let jamie take the lead . she 'll let you know what she needs . 
i 'm sorry . i did n't know . 
have i told you how proud i am of you -- ? 
but if it does n't happen grab for something within reach . life 's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment -- 
that 'd be something . 
that 's eight years of school and training -- after college . and all that does n't necessarily make you a better human being . 
you do . you 're handsome and charming . 
honey some of this is ... farfetched . you take after me . people skills and common sense . good dependable qualities . 
you sleeping with her ? 
were you with jamie ? 
a late night or an early morning ? 
to see your father ? 
i have n't seen clay or eric lately . 
there 's hot cider in the kitchen . 
you look nice . i should have dressed . 
you going to let him ? you going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to ? 
after he moved out i invited him to every practice every game every parent - teacher conference you ever had . he did n't show not once . 
you saw him ? 
i ca n't know things if you do n't tell me . 
out with belinda ? 
it could help with a new car -- 
your father dropped off an extra check . 
about a job . 
you do n't need a car you ca n't drive for a month . go see marvin . 
why not ? 
what if they expel you ? 
landon . i ca n't even do for myself . 
can i -- go out ? 
it 's not that simple .   it costs money to do this at home . 
no .   maybe i believe god has a bigger dream for me than i had for myself .   maybe i believe the journey the big adventure never ends ... 
it 's gone now . 
better . i was really angry . 
that was read at my parents ' wedding . 
lower . same page . 
you know how to waltz ? ? 
i 'm not going back to school . 
that 's what i mean . 
i do n't want to come here anymore . 
that i want you to take me home . 
i used to like yogurt . 
help me live until i die ? 
all the time .   i feel like i have no one . 
no . the drugs just stopped working . if anything doing things i love kept me healthy longer . 
i should have told you sooner -- 
the doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible .   i did n't want anyone being -- weird around me . 
i 'm sick . 
pull over . 
i 'm not applying to college . 
yes one of many . 
yes . i try to keep my power . 
care but just do n't let it get to you . it gives them power . 
from citizen high to citizen low . 
here . why am i looking at this star ? 
i 'm always home by midnight and he 's always asleep . 
are you trying to seduce me ? 
you planned this -- 
mars does n't rise until 2:30 
so what do you want to see ? 
in my back yard .   i lied before . it 's hardly started . but when it 's done it will have twice the power of this one -- 
it 's an alt - azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one . 
i was twelve . 
the truth . i just left you out of it . 
what would you do up here ? 
how do you know this place ? 
the challenger exploded . principal kelly 's about to make an announcement . 
twice a year . 
that . and less strange . 
you make me feel ... 
i might do it wrong . 
i do n't understand ... 
wonder . beauty . joy .   love . 
uncertainty makes you uncomfortable . 
i 'm sure . pretty sure . 
it 's places like this that make me certain there 's a god . 
you 're acting like a crazy person . 
that what 's happening to you only faster ? 
excuse me ? 
what are you talking about ? 
we 're doing something -- ? 
it 's only 7:30 . 
is there a rush ? 
i ca n't believe you asked my father 's permission . 
i 'm not allowed to date . 
yes . but not as a date date . 
like fire . 
why are you doing all this ? to impress me ? 
i heard what you did . thank you . 
it means you can do anything . 
when i have something to say . 
it 's a start . 
and why would that scare me ? 
you do n't know what you want -- 
you do n't know the first thing about being someone 's friend -- 
prove it . 
all of it . 
that sounds like horseshit . 
people can see . 
you 're hardly nice to anyone . 
thank you . so were you . 
healthy as can be . 
then maybe you can read mine . 
so it 's like you want to be secret friends . 
that would be the reason . 
or anywhere where people might see us . 
oh . just not at school ... 
yes . and ? 
you do n't miss a thing . 
the play 's going to be really good . 
he does n't trust you . 
interpreted by another guy like my father . 
you do n't believe in anything ? 
i know there 's a plan for everyone but sometimes i do n't understand what the message is -- or what the point is . 
do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do ? 
do n't you ? 
my relationship with god is my own . 
in ten words or less ? 
yeah .   i 'm probably not going to be around next time it comes . 
i 'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of haley 's comet -- 
i hope so .   i think maybe she sees me now . 
looking for something -- someone . 
maybe debris from a moon that broke apart . 
before voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings -- 
that is my telescope . 
could be ... 
cuz it 's dark and quiet and you can see into another world . 
do you think i 'm strange ? 
because i try to be nice to people ? 
you think so . 
i know . do n't say anything . 
i 'll get something for us to drink -- 
and you have to meet my father . 
i do know .   be two places at once ... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel ... eat breakfast with chopsticks ... 
spend a year in the peace corps . make a medical discovery -- 
it 's private . 
it 's like a to - do list but for my life . 
i 'll take a chance . 
are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know ? 
the reason i got the part ... i 'm a little like lizzie . except i do n't worry about some man rescuing me . 
kinda . yeah . 
28 is do something illegal . 42 is befriend an enemy . 
so you agree you need help ? 
like me . 
i know you do n't want help . 
-- your act only works with an audience . 
-- i know you do n't suck at acting . 
-- this play means a lot to me . 
' is it really me ? ' 
' they wo n't . ' 
good cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person . 
ca n't you have a normal conversation ? 
you mean care what you say ? i 'm worrying about other things . 
-- i wear the sweater because i 'm cold . i read because no one talks to me . my hair is my hair . what is it exactly that 's bothering you ? 
you do n't know me . 
because growing up books were my world . 
i do n't make small talk -- 
he goes to my father 's church . he could 've died -- 
when mom died you told me god wanted her more loved her more -- 
by making me ill he is punishing me !   i just do n't know what for . 
i am mad at you ! and at landon ! and the universe ! and god !   i do n't even know where to put all my anger . 
no you did n't .   but he did change . just not enough . 
this -- him -- landon -- is what 's best for me ! 
maybe . but that 's not the real reason . you think if i tell he 'll disappear and that 's what you want ! me all to yourself ! 
i have expectations too . 
it was a play . 
up to ? 
dad i 've become a woman without her . just not a pretty one . 
fine . but i need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life . 
i 'm supposed to always be alone ? 
by accident -- 
he wants help with his lines -- 
does he bite ? 
what do you feed him ? 
that your spider in there ? in that bottle ? 
what 'd they look like ? 
do n't you ever get bored around here ? 
well i 've felt that way had n't you ? 
i 've got to stick by kit ... he feels trapped . 
you love him ? 
what 's your friend 's name ? 
you have to ask kit . he says frog i jump . 
i just do n't want to go . 
you know ... they 'd probably ask to see your driver 's license before they hired you . 
i 'm sorry . i was n't listening . 
how about over here ? 
yeah then we 'd be stuck here . 
it was going too fast . 
i 'm serious . 
well i feel kind of like an animal living out here . i mean there 's no place to bathe and ... no place to get anything good to eat . 
that 's montana over there . 
i 'd like to get out of here . 
do n't . 
well why you always walking behind me ? 
later we found out she was deaf and we had n't even known it . 
i do n't want a steak . 
what 'd you put him in there for ? 
i do n't know . 
just looking . 
is he upset ? 
how 's he doing ? 
i found a lid . it was laying on the ground over there . 
i 'm fine . kind of tired . 
suppose the neighbors heard the noise ? 
listen maybe we ought to tell somebody about this . 
are you sure ? 
we better call the doctor ... listen . i 'll say how it happened part i saw . 
how bad off is he ? 
do n't call me stupid . 
but it would hurt . 
gosh what was everybody talking about ? 
is that all there is to it ? 
did it go the way it ' uz supposed to ? 
i do n't care . 
my stomach 's growling . 
and the flowers ... let 's not pick them . they 're so nice . 
what a nice place . 
just do n't ... i 've got a headache . 
yeah but i do n't like it . 
i know . 
well i got homework . 
i do n't know .

i got ta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings - i've got mixed emotions - i do n't know if i can handle this .   oh boy ... 
hanoi shan-- ?   the guy in your comic books .   boss of the world crime league ?   supreme commander of the legion of death ?   the pivot of mystery himself ?   you 're putting me on .   he 's a cartoon character . 
yes i do .   gimme a chance .   i 'm stronger than you think . 
how did she die ?   i wanna know .

oh my . 
she must 've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you ... 
i 'll shoot yours off if i had a gun you double - dealing casanova !   i thought you liked me for myself .   but why should you huh ?   a jerk like me . 
any time .

somewhere .   see i was taken away by the priddies when i was a baby .   i was adopted . 
i do n't know . i always felt like i did like there was another me ...

no .   laramie .   except i was born in cody . how did you know that ?   oh right sure i forgot : you know everything . 
the netherlands .   whew that 's a long way from wyoming . 
it 's kinda hard this way . 
the girl i remind you of .

did i say anything was wrong ? i just sponged up a little too much vat 69 okay ? i 'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town i ca n't get my luggage outta hock 'cause i met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record .   he offered to set me up for life and like a fool well i ... 
my name is penny . penny priddy .   there i 've said it but it wo n't mean anything to you .   i 'm a nobody . 
penny .   i 'd rather not reveal my last name or my age . 
this is so embarrassing ... 
better than him . 
what 's his problem ? 
where 's buckaroo ?   is he alive ? 
what 'd you do before ?   can i ask ? 
how long you been riding with buckaroo reno ? 
and my input was mostly ... editorial really when he 'd been drinking- 
barton honestly only the last couple- 
barton i think we should concentrate on our little project- 
well bill was always the author so to speak- 
before what ? 
well the basic ideas were frequently his- 
well ... this . 
well usually they 're ... simply morality tales . there 's a good wrestler and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end . in between the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect .   bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type or a convict . and sometimes instead of a waif he 'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild .   the studio always hated that . oh some of the scripts were so ... spirited ! 
yes i 'm afraid i have . 
it 's alright barton . you do n't have to write actual scenes ? 
oh he 's ... he drifted off . he 'll sleep for a while now . what is it you have to do exactly ? 
now that 's all right barton . everything'll be all right . 
hello barton . 
if i can . he gets jealous ; he- 
... who is this ? 
barton . empathy requires ... understanding . 
he 'll wander back when he 's sober and apologize . he always does . 
no sometimes he just ... well he thinks about estelle . his wife still lives in fayettesville . she 's ... disturbed . 
... oh barton i feel so ... sorry for him ! 
let him go . 
... i know this must look ... funny . 
barton . you see barton i 'm not just bill 's secretary  bill and i are ... i love . we- 
perhaps the three of us mr. fink . 
i 'll tell bill you dropped by . i 'm sure he 'll want to reschedule your appointment . 
i 'll be fine ... are you a writer mr fink ? 
i am sorry it 's so embarassing . 
he will be ... when he ca n't write he drinks . 
i 'll try to slip out . if he quiets down passes out ... i 'm afraid he thinks  well he said you were a buffoon barton . he becomes irrational 
all right barton i 'll see if i can slip away- 
barton i 'm afraid it 's not a good time- 
stop it bill ! 
not anything bill . do n't test me . 
that does n't help anything bill . 
that 's hamburger grease bill . 
i got a message on my machine to meet gus here .   where is he ? 
what are you doing here ? 
she 's evil .   she 's brilliant .   be careful nick . 
i got married .   he was on staff at the clinic .   i was down in salinas .   it did n't ... last long . 
she knew you 'd find out who lisa henderson is .   you 're a good cop -- what did she do ?   tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant ?   did she tell you in bed nick ? that 's how i 'd do it . 
she 's really sick you know .   do n't you know what she 's doing ?   she knows i went to berkeley .   she knows i knew noah .   she makes up that story about me .   she 's handing you somebody who 's obsessed with he her . 
i had him in two classes . 
i did dye my hair .   it did n't have anything to do with her .   i was a redhead for a while too . 
i slept with her once in school .   i was just a kid .   i was experimenting .   it was just that one time .   she developed a ... fixation ... on me .   she styled her hair like mine . she wore the same kind of clothes i did .   it scared me . 
she told you did n't she ? 
what do you want nick ? 
i know the type .   i 'm a psychologist . 
my interest is in you not in her . she seduces people she manipulates -- 
yes you do .   something 's on with you .   you 're sleeping with her are n't you ? 
what is your problem ?   i 'm trying to help you .   why wo n't you let me help you ? 
yes you did .   i 'm a big girl .   i can handle it . 
i hardly knew her .   she gave me the creeps though .   i do n't know why . 
she must really be something .   from a clinical point of view . 
how do you know catherine tramell saw my reports ? 
it 's the least i could do ... considering i got you into this mess with those reports . 
yes .   i care about you .   i did it for you . 
sometimes i really hate you . 
no nick please -- 
it 's a confidential psychiatric record it 'd be illegal --she backs into a wall .   she looks very scared . he comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall . 
what are you talking about nick -- what 's wrong with you ? 
i thought you quit . 
we were in some of the same classes . 
catherine tramell . 
what was she like ? 
baby - sitting .   rookie cop . 
you do n't look so okay . 
you okay ? 
how 's not smoking ? 
how about the coke ? 
how about the booze ? 
how is your -- personal life ? 
so -- how are things ? 
i know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with okay ? 
as long as internal affairs wants you to i suppose .   sit down nick . 
how are you nick ? 
i hate rugrats . 
what do we do now nick ? 
the games are over .   you were right . it was the fuck of the century shooter . 
what do you want nick ?   flowers ? i 'll send you some flowers . 
i told you .   she kills him . 
i finished my book . 
somebody always does . 
somebody has to die . 
it wo n't sell . 
what happens to them ? 
really .   what are you writing about . 
what are you researching ? 
i 'm very good at research .   i 'll help you . 
come over here and tell me no . 
did you miss me ? 
i decided to give you one more chance .   i missed you . 
you still think i kill people do n't you ? 
you 're not going to tell me what she 's doing .   i thought we were n't playing games anymore . 
did you ?   what 's she doing ? 
i just thought i 'd surprise you .   what 's the matter ? 
of course i knew . 
honey why do n't you go in the car ?   i 'll be right there . 
what did he say ? 
i 'll convince you . 
do you believe me ? 
maybe i 'm losing interest in my book . 
i would 've paid more .   i wanted to know everything about you .   then you came down here after johnny got killed ... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better . 
i 'd read about your shootings in the papers .   i decided to write a book about a detective .   i wanted to know my character . 
about three months before i met you . 
i paid him $ 50000 in cash for your psychiatric file . 
you wo n't believe me . 
no more games nick .   i 'm tired of playing games ! 
i never have before . 
no she did n't ... she never got jealous before ... she got excited .   i do n't have luck with women . there was this girl i met while i was in college .   i slept with her once .   she started following me around taking my picture .   she dyed her hair copied my clothes . lisa something ... oberman .   it was awful . 
for what ... to set me up ?   she loved me she would n't frame me . 
make love to me . 
everybody that i care about dies . 
do you think i told her to kill you ? 
i should have known .   i came into the house when you were down on the beach .   she looked at me so strangely .   she left right after you .   i should n't have let her watch us . she wanted to watch me all the time .   she tried to kill you did n't she ? 
you 're in over your head . 
you should n't play this game . 
i told you i had a vivid imagination . 
do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets ?   i do n't do those . 
fine .   how 's your back ? 
do you want her to join us sometime ? 
i thought it was a pretty good beginning . 
did you think it was so special ? 
she 's seen everything before . 
i 'm leaving the house around midnight .   in case you 're going to follow me .   i 'm going down to johnny 's club . 
i 'm getting deeper and deeper into my character . 
why take the risk ? 
good .   i 'd miss you .   you can get into trouble though . you 're not really a cop anymore . 
you 're not going to stop following me around now just because you 're on leave -- are you ? 
no .   i wrote it years afterwards . 
you mean did i write it before my parents died ? 
to see if he can get away with it . 
a boy kills his parents .   they have a plane .   he makes it look like an accident . 
are n't you going to thank me ? 
it 's not the same thing is it ? 
bitch mostly but he meant it affectionately .   you do n't have any coke do you ?   i love coke and jack daniel 's . 
cheers .   my friends call me catherine . 
i know nicky but i like it . 
what if i call you nicky ? 
is n't he the policeman that you shot shooter ? 
not me . 
why not ? 
you 're not easy to figure .   i 'm just very good at figuring . 
do you ? 
i was n't talking about real friends . why does n't gus like me . 
i have attorneys .   they have friends .   i have friends .   money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends . 
yes you did .   they never tested you did they ?   but internal affairs knew . 
what happened nick ?   did you get sucked into it ? did you like it too much ? 
only in theory .   you know all about homicidal impulse do n't you shooter ?   not in theory -- in practice . 
yes .   she 's helped me understand homicidal impulse . 
noah was my counselor in my freshman year .   that 's probably where i got the idea for the icepick .   for my book . funny how the subconscious works .   hazel is my friend . 
there 's a name from the past . 
four shootings in five years .   all accidents . 
i do n't know .   but you do . 
i 'd like to ask you some too . 
would you like a drink ?   i was just going to have one . 
no .   come in . 
you know i do n't like to wear any underwear do n't you nick ? 
you know all about me . 
you see ?   we 're both innocent nick . 
because i 'm a professional liar . i spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies .   for my writing . 
if i were guilty and if i wanted to beat that machine it would n't be tiring .   it would n't be tiring at all . 
i 'm tired . 
you still get the pleasure .   did n't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married nick ? 
that 's right . 
i felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game . 
i loved him .   i hurt . 
i 've got a degree in psych .   it goes with the turf .   games are fun . 
yes it does does n't it ? 
no .   i said i liked johnny to use his hands .   i do n't give any rules nick .   i go with the flow . 
i have nothing to hide . 
did i miss something ? 
a detective .   he falls for the wrong woman . 
it wo n't last . 
i found some in my purse ; would you like one ? 
yes you do . 
do you have a cigarette ? 
only when they make interesting reading . 
are you arresting me ? 
no .   i was n't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night . 
no .   we had a drink at the club . we left together .   i came here . he went home . 
about a year and a half . 
i was n't dating him .   i was fucking him . 
i know who you are . 
i 'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way i described in my book . i 'd be announcing myself as the killer .   i 'm not stupid . 
exactly what do you have in mind mr. corrigan . 
i had sex with him for about a year and a half .   i liked having sex with him . 
what are you going to do ?   charge me with smoking ? 
no thank you . 
i 'm a writer   i use people for what i write .   you write what you know .   let the world beware . 
in the beginning .   then i got to like what he did for me . 
the answer is no .   i did n't kill him . 
you make it up but it has to be believable .   they call it suspension of disbelief . 
it teaches you to lie . 
yes i am . 
why would i need an attorney ? 
read me my rights and arrest me and i 'll go downtown . 
i do n't really feel like talking anymore . 
really .   maybe that 's why you 're from homicide .   how ? 
how did he die ? 
i really think you should talk to him about this . 
you should talk to him about this . 
are n't they ? 
who is it ? 
you do n't have to be sorry . there 's no one to blame . jean you 're a real artist . i thought i was one . you made me realize i was n't . 
i do n't believe it jean  they 're picking straws . 
that is amazing . what year is it ? 
what 's that about ? 
pretty much the same . 
so . are you ready ? i start columbia next fall . of course there 's like a year of pre - med stuff but  whatever . i 'm really excited .   and : rene gave me a job as his secretary . his poems are getting published . 
do n't you think he 's using you ? 
so are you really friends with andy ? he seems like such a weirdo . 
what 's that ? 
you 're your own baby . 
you mean babies with you ? 
it looks done . 
staten island would be ok . 
i had n't thought about it . 
well thanks ! 
basquiat do n't lie .   this is smack . 
basquiat what did you take ? 
you 're blaming me ? i had to go see my family . 
it 's monday morning .

you do n't have any fucking money .. 
i 'm going to my parents this weekend . what am i going to wear ?   how could you do that to me ? 
basquiat those are my best clothes ! ! ! what are you doing ?

yeah if you have any dimes left . 477- 0496 .

i think i could do that alone . 
guess i just got sick of him . 
no do n't tell me  you just got fired by your crazy boss . 
i need this ? 
i just do n't think you 're being fair . 
pipe down lech . let him order . 
... what do we do ? 
a kiss under the mistletoe . mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it ... 
i do n't know anymore bruce ... 
now do n't give me a killing - max- won't - solve - anything speech because it will .   are n't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top ?   when he should be six feet under ? 
you first . 
guess i 'm sick of wearing masks ... 
there 's a big comfy california king over in bedding .   what say we ... 
' s'okay i had to go home feed my cat . 
nor i on the second . 
and the truth frightened her ? 
what went wrong ?   hang on i think i know ... you kept things from her . 
executive assistant .   secretary .   girlfriend ? 
i 'm sure he 's wonderful company and all but ... does n't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale ? 
yes and no ... 
yeah ?   me too ... 
no darker than yours bruce . 
i detest violence but ... christmas complacency can be a downer too . 
-- and it 's gon na be a hot time in the cold town tonight . 
the news these days ... weird . people looking to superheroes for their peace of mind and blaming their problems on super - villains ... instead of themselves or their spouses at least . 
treat to be here . 
scare me ?   no actually i was just scaring myself ... 
pouring myself into my work . 
i 'm listed . 
well that 's a ... long story ... 
you do n't seem like the type who does business with mr. shreck . 
yes and no ... 
you mean mistook < u > me</u > ? 
have we ? 
morning max .   bummer about the store .   you insured ? 
that 's my name maximillions . do n't wear it out babe or i 'll make you buy me a new one . 
okay go ahead .   intimidate me bully me if it makes you feel big .   i mean it 's not like you can just kill me . 
it 's our secret .   honest .   how can you be so mean to someone so meaningless ? 
too good ? 
i 'm no cat .   i 'm just an assistant . a < u > secretary</u > -- 
big giant < u > capacitor</u > .   and that instead of generating power it 'll sort of be --   -- < u > sucking</u > power from gotham city and storing it ... stockpiling it sort of ?   which unless i 'm being dense is a novel approach i 'd say . 
no i am .   yes i 'm boning up for your bruce wayne meeting in the morning .   i pulled all the files on the proposed power plant and mr. wayne 's hoped - for investment ... i 've studied up on all of it ... i even opened the protected files and -- 
not good . 
i 'm hungry .   i think i 'll have poultry . 
the way to a boy 's heart is through his ego .   what strapping young hero could resist his very own ... signal ? 
as a team the duncely duo protect each other .   but the robin is young . impetuous .   if i could get him alone- 
ca n't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry ? 
i have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals .   once you have frozen mankind my mutants will overrun the globe .   the earth will become a brave new world of only plants . and we shall rule them .   for we will be the only two people left in the world . 
just what i had in mind .   everything dead on earth except us .   a chance for mother nature to start again .   plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man .   sorry hon this is for science .   behold the dawn of a new age . 
kill them .   of course .   but why stop there ?   why should only batman and robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished ? 
there was nothing i could do .   batman deactivated her .   she 's dead . 
make yourself right at home . 
ok ok .   ms. ivy to the rescue .   now where do i find your brittle bride ? 
hold it .   you never said anything about a wife frozen or otherwise- 
trust me .   vegetable magnetism . 
you leave batman and robin to me . 
you are looking unseasonably hot . let 's go inside and grab your rocks . 
i wonder if i can get a cell with a view of the gardens ? 
i love that belt .   what are you about a fifty big and tall ? 
let 's cool it for now .   there 's someone i want you to meet . 
well i my most unabominable snowman have been impressed by you . in fact i propose a pairing .   so i 'm here to set you free . 
listen captain cold the suit maybe even though silver went out in the 70 's .   but those boots are unforgivable . what is it with men ? 
you 're too late .   say bye - bye birdie . 
love you ?   i loathe your bipedal arrogance your animal superiority . my only joy is knowing that even now my poison kiss is sucking the life from your ape - like face . 
you should have heeded your pointy- eared pal .   these lips can be murder . 
bad luck i 'm afraid .   it 's time to die little bird . 
one kiss my love .   for luck . 
freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun .   he 's about to turn gotham into an ice cube . 
kiss me and i 'll tell you . 
how about dangerous curves ? 
i 'm glad you came .   i ca n't breathe without you . 
at you ?   polly want a kiss ? 
did two - face call him bruce ? 
maybe you just have n't met the right woman ... 
you like strong women . i 've done my homework . or do i need skin - tight vinyl and a whip ? 
we could give it a try . i 'll bring the wine you bring the scarred psyche . 
my life 's an open book . you read ? 
i do n't mind the work . pity i ca n't see behind the mask . 
now black rubber . 
what is it about the wrong kind of man ? in grade school it was guys with earrings . college motorcycles and leather jackets . 
a girl can not live by psychoses alone . 
i wish i could say my interest in you was purely professional ... 
last night at the circus . i noticed something about dent . his coin . he 's obsessed with justice . it 's his achilles ' heel . it can be exploited . 
he 's home . i sent the signal . 
i did n't know that . see ? you _ are _ interesting . and call me chase . by the way do you have a first name ? or do i just call you bats ? 
let 's just say i could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent . 
i 'm flattered . not every girl makes a super - hero 's night table .   you might have some interesting insights into two - face . 
_ two _ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _ second _ bank of gotham on the _ 22nd _ how could harvey ? _ two_-face resist ? 
what are you talking about ? 
oh god bruce you were a child . you were n't responsible . 
you do know . try . 
what does it say ? what hurts so much bruce ? what does the book say ? 
stop fighting . 
your memories are repressed . they 're trying to break through . relax . try to remember- . 
okay tiger take it slow . you going to give me your pin or something ? 
excuse me boys . i 'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account- 
oh god bruce . you 're still jealous . 
touchy touchy . 
if i did n't know better i 'd say you were sulking . 
in a sense we are all two people . the side we show in daylight . and that side we keep in shadow . 
you want me close but you wo n't let me near . what 's the terrible dark secret you 're protecting everyone from ? 
throw up that ridiculous superficial mask . if you 're jealous ... 
why do you do that ? 
what do you want me to say ? that i 'm not attracted to him ? 
come on bruce . this is what i do for a living . 
find anything interesting ? 
and now .... 
sorry . i have n't even had time to unpack . instant coffee okay ? 
you could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang- . i think he felt it too . 
well i met someone ... 
bruce much to my surprise you seem like a really great guy ... 
the glib cavalier routine it really is an act is n't it ? 
i do n't get you bruce wayne . 
like normal folks . 
i 'm surprised you are n't blind by now . 
excuse me . 
would you ? i 'm not so sure . 
that 's usually my line . 
you understand obsession better than you let on . 
the letter writer is obsessed with you . his only escape may be ... 
what do you know about obsession ? 
i think the question would be do you have a thing for bats ? 
patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles . work better for you ? 
my opinion . this letter writer is a total wacko . 
she 's a malaysian dream warden . she stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams .   need one ? 
the infamous wayne charm . does it ever shut off ? 
psychiatrists make you nervous ? 
how can i help you mr. wayne ? 
you 're right edward . i did n't mean to be impolite . please . 
who is the batman edward ? 
dr. burton tells me you know who batman is . 
it 's dr. meridian . chase . do you remember me ? 
you could 've killed him you know . you could 've killed the joker . 
if you do n't mind my asking ... who 's close to you ? 
i just ca n't absorb it all . this place the equipment . what it must have cost .   why all the secrecy ? why do you wear the mask ? 
that ca n't be right . that would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned . we 'd all be dead . 
what is that ? 
i loathe bats . 
how 'd you find this place ? 
it does n't protect your head though . 
what is this stuff ? kevlar ? 
well i 've certainly enjoyed it . -- what 's that ? 
... how long have i been out ? 
... where are you taking me ? 
how do i know you wo n't keep them all ? 
look i appreciate what you did for me . but this is my job . and i 'm keeping those pictures . 
i wo n't let you have it . 
i just wanted to distract them . i was n't trying to get a picture of you . 
well -- i think you might consider 
... a hundred and eight ? 
ca n't we -- 
what about the girl ? 
should n't we -- 
look ! police ! 
which car ? 
i do n't but ... i do . it 's just ... i love you bruce . i do n't want you to ... 
i do n't know why i 'm doing this . i half wish you 'd stay a cripple . 
i 'm frightened of you bruce . i 'm frightened for you . 
what now ? 
how can you do that if she 's already off the line ? 
i 'm sorry she hung up . what are -- 
... where are you calling from ? 
oh bruce . do n't tell me you carry it around with you . 
it 's like the last time . he sent me a present before he -- 
bruce at the rate you 're going you ca n't even save yourself . 
you 're one man . you ca n't save everybody . 
i do n't understand it . you can do so much good for people . as bruce wayne . 
so we just pretend none of this ever happened . we never met . we --   -- you 're going to get yourself killed bruce . you know that do n't you ? 
i 'm serious bruce . we have to -- ! 
... i know it 's you bruce . i 'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it ... 
i wish you 'd ... 
well bruce -- i do n't think -- that would be possible . 
yes bruce -- i 'm here -- 
all street mimes should be executed . 
mm - hmm .   lunch .   not even dinner . 
to tell you the truth i 'd just about given up waiting . 
then there 's one thing in the world you do n't do very well . and i know what it is -- now you 'll have to kill me . 
... we could try that . 
god .   you would .   come on bruce .   i just want to get two drinks in you .   as an experiment . 
but it 's not fair .   i 'm half drunk and you 're not even -- 
i 'm sorry bruce i just ca n't seem to get a handle on this conversation . 
as much as i do .   it 's not that .   i do n't want to be depressing that 's all . 
bruce really when i say these things i do n't mean to criticize you . 
well bruce some types are a little more obvious than others . 
... terror . 
well .   a couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid i went down there for newsweek . the beaches were nice .   and at nights -- they had a band -- i danced on the hotel patio .   of course i never saw what was really happening there . when the war broke out i had to go back . and i promised myself that this time ... i would n't look away . 
neither had i.   odd desire for a woman i guess . 
that 's a tough one .   have you ever seen combat ? 
do you sail ? 
as far as i know . 
i 'll see you burn .   i 'll see you dead -- get away from me ! ! 
you scum !   you sick filth ! ... you did that to her ! 
... why the mask ? 
i 've seen worse .   much worse . 
maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist .   people might like to see the face behind the makeup . 
and you want a -- 
... thank you . 
god yes allie . i 've got ta say -- that was the ballsiest move i ever ... 
you okay ? 
look ! it 's bruce ! !   allies -- the balloons . we 've got to find some way to tell him ! 
yeah . deja vu . 
it 's gone . 
allie ... he wants to tell me . i had a roll of film . his face was on it . he knew that -- and he let me keep . 
he 's not crazy . 
allie he 's not . 
i 've had it with you .   i 'm leaving . 
alexander ... i know you . 
he 's best friends with jim gordon and harvey dent .   they would know . 
allie i know exactly why you 're doing this . 
are they paying you for all this ? 
you are on drugs . 
oh bruce ... 
his face .   allie look at his face . 
plain or roasted ?   alex i 'm very flattered that you 've gone out and done all this research . 
guess who 's got a date with bruce wayne ? 
yum yum . 
oh .   sorry .   i was thinking . 
that and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks . 
rich .   reclusive .   bankrolls half a dozen charities . 
all aver the world .   they say he 's spent half of his life overseas . 
some .   i am a rich bitch remember ?   i 'm quoting . 
our next d.a. -- i hear bruce wayne is throwing a fundraiser .   did you get your invitation yet ? 
evildoers huh ?   big or small ? 
a girl could get killed - - so they tell me .   what 's new and hot in gotham city ? 
burned out .   i need a vacation . 
how 'd you know it was me ? 
he 's not too bad .   i can live with him . 
no i 'm fine . 
maybe i ought to think about getting another job . 
it was nothing .   we 're not ... he just makes me laugh .   when was the last time we laughed ?   any of us ? 
about charles ... 
let 's get a coffee . 
nothing ever really changes does it david ? 
0 my god . 
at least you did n't bring mr bean with you . 
honestly david you 're so spineless . 
great .   you said you 'd ask grierson about putting our guest somewhere else .   did you ? 
hi .....   roses . 
now what does that mean ?   my daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed and i 'm supposed to think it 's amusing ?   that tie 's god - awful .   why do you wear it ? 
david i 'm serious ! 
shut up kevin .   honey you - re not making sense ... 
your face smells like a foot . 
there were three strawberries . 
go ahead . 
i need some time david .   a little time .   it 's not just you .   it 's partly me . 
it is n't working any more david . 
what 's wrong with you david ?   all you have to do is say excuse me i 've been sitting here since the start of the millennium and i 'd really like some action from you before the end of the world . i 'll go . 
did you really ask ? 
it 's the last thing we need . 
david - are you ever going to learn to say ' no ' ? 
do we know anything about him ? 
and what did you say ? 
there are n't hotels ? 
jennifer can stay and look after kevin 
do n't ask him about work charlie . life 's too short . 
oh adam do n't tease her .   you never got an a in science in your life ! 
3:30 i guess . 
just a hunch . 
we 've been given a gift here honey .   a real live little girl . she likes us a lot .   she needs us . maybe that 's why we died so young to keep us from getting so ... attached to < u > things</u > .   the house antiques your model .   look at us . we did n't have room for anyone . 
you can build another one ... with her . 
ah adam you do n't know anything about little girls .   she 's just ... missed out on some love that 's all ... 
you know i 've been thinking .   i could teach lydia to sew . 
lydia believe me ... we know ... all the hard stuff is the same over here .   you 're going to be who you are ... whether you 're alive or dead ... and over here -- it 's ... it 's flat ... there 's no food no colors ... you ca n't smell the flowers .   if we knew then what we know now we 'd have been more careful ... 
< u > adam</u > !   why did you build a whorehouse ?   have you ever been to ... ? 
he might have hurt somebody . 
who did the sushi ? 
the sushi ?   i did the wine . did n't you do the sushi ? 
i do n't care i 've changed my mind .   ... i feel < u > really</u > confident .   we 're getting better at this stuff .   we can scare them off ourselves -- tonight !   i 've got an idea .   you 're going to love it ... i 'm going to hate it . 
i am not going to expose that little girl to that ... pervert down there . 
no we do n't .   we can work something out ourselves .   we just have to try harder . 
honey .   let 's go . 
she 's only fourteen ... 
maybe we should knock first ? 
oh adam .   i do n't have gloves .   my nails keep getting longer .   i 'll break them . 
bet ... el ... geuse .   what an awful name .   i thought it was like -- you know .   the < u > juice</u > of < u > beetles</u > . 
what happened ? 
< u > betelgeuse</u > ! 
... yes this must be him .   look ... betelgeuse ... betelgeuse ... 
here 's something . 
then it should be here . 
did you copy these gravestones right adam ? 
adam you had a photo of big foot ! 
lydia 's trying but they do n't believe her . 
you know you 're really a pretty girl . 
well i do n't know ... we do n't get many visitors . 
i feel really stupid . 
god this is so corny .   have we been reduced to this ?   sheets ? 
that guy is in our cemetery .   oh adam . 
we probably would n't mind sharing the house with people who were -- 
look at this everything is different down here .   all our furniture is gone . 
no .   but it 's somewhere without big worms . 
yet another triumph for adam and barbara in the afterlife . 
draw door ?   i do n't know why we keep looking in that stupid book . 
i do n't know ... what are you looking up ? 
we do n't know who he is ...   ... i 'm going to talk to that little girl . 
we 're not going to wait here like cornered animals .   i can tell you that .   we need help .   i 'm going to talk to that little girl . 
but she < u > saw</u > us .   i could feel it . 
that little girl saw us . 
that 's it ?   no number or instructions ? 
look in the index ... maybe there 's like an emergency number or something . 
death did n't improve your sense of humor . 
we 're trapped in this house forever ... with those ... people . 
i know .   i 'm sorry . 
oh adam do n't ever leave me alone . 
whatever it is it ca n't be worse than this . 
no i 'm not putting up with this . 
we 're not completely helpless . i 've been reading the book . there 's a word for people in our predicament honey . 
is this a punishment for something we did in life ?   what can we do ? 
adam we < u > are</u > in hell .   i hate these people . 
i guess ... if i 'm going to be dead i 'll just have to be the best dead person ever ! 
at least we wo n't have to worry about her . 
just says ' wo n't . '   wait a minute . here it says ' the living are arrogant ... they think they 'll never die so they refuse to see the dead . ' 
she ca n't see you right ?   in the book rule number two : the living usually wo n't see the dead . 
what 's she doing here ? 
dishes ?   we have n't eaten in three weeks !   adam i 'm not like you i really need to be around < u > people</u > get out to the church and go grocery shopping . 
in heaven there would n't be dust on the wallpaper . 
i ca n't clean anything .   the vacuum is out in the garage .   i ca n't leave the house .   why do n't they tell us something ?   where are all the other dead people in the world ?   why is it just you and me ? 
there are a thousand things ... why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch ?   is this a punishment ?   are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell ? and how long is this going to < u > last</u > ? 
i do n't like situations like this . i hate it when i 'm not in control . so just tell me the basics . 
i do n't think we survived the crash . 
de < u > ceased</u > .   i do n't know where it came from . 
yes it did .   yes it did .   i made a couple of small discoveries . here 's one . 
that 's how long you were gone . 
two hours . 
oh adam .   we 're home .   in our own house .   nonsense .   i 'll make some coffee .   you get some more firewood . 
i am sitting . 
i 'm not sure .   it feels ... frozen . 
this fire was n't burning when we left the house . 
oh ... i 'm sorry ... 
you 're doing it adam .   you 're saving this town . 
adam your bozman building is a beauty . 
wave at the lion . 
i know ... i just wish she 'd leave us alone . 
jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family . 
oh no . 
oh honey i 'm so glad we 're spending our vacation at home . 
helen got it for me in oslo . 
oh adam the model looks so good . the historical society will love it .   you 've finished the streets ? 
i 'm so sorry we frightened you . what were you doing ? 
i do n't like charles deetz particularly but you could have < u > killed</u > him . 
home .   < u > home</u > .   < u > home</u > ! 
just one daughter . 
just get some people out of our house . 
we 're ... 
what about betelgeuse ? 
about what ? 
our cemetery ? 
what do you mean ?   what 's he do ? 
if ... we have trouble .   what about the guy in the flyer ?   betelge ... 
we 're very unhappy . 
we need help .   we deserve help . 
are you juno our case worker ? 
how 'd you do on the science test ? 
so < u > never</u > let beetle juice out . never .   besides ...   we 're thinking about letting everyone stay ... you and your father and mother can stay too . 
no you do n't !   no ... lydia ... why ? 
no lydia we 're dead . 
no wait ! 
wait ... i do n't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we 're up here . 
we ca n't .   we have n't left the house since the funeral . 
tell the truth . 
we 're practicing . 
if i had seen a ghost at your age i would have been frightened out of my wits . 
' bye jane i 'll see you in church in a couple weeks . 
and live in what our station wagon ? 
jane do n't send photographs of our house around the country ! we 're not interested in selling . 
no !   jane it is 6:45 in the morning ! 
that 's right jane .   complete vacation . 
oh puh - leeze ! 
so can i ? 
i got an a ! 
i got it .   and i took pictures of the new church for you too . 
really .   i do n't know . 
wait a minute .   i had some licorice ice cream earlier .   you guys could be gas .   what if ... i 'm dreaming . can you do any neat tricks to prove you 're not gas ? 
god if this is true this is like amazing !   i kinda like it up here . can i visit you sometimes ? 
you do n't know the deetzes very well do you ?   my father bought this place .   he never walks away from equity .   why do n't < u > you</u > leave ? 
and this used to be your house i bet .   why do you want to scare everybody ? 
< u > you</u > did this ?   you carved all these little figures and houses and things ? 
stepmother .   i 'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles . 
why are you creeping around delia 's bedroom ? 
i 'm wearing contacts ... also i read through < u > handbook for the</u > < u > recently deceased</u > .   it says that live people ignore the strange and unusual ... not me ... < u > i am</u > strange and unusual . 
is this like a trick question ? 
< u > night of the living dead</u > ?   it 's this gross movie . 
i 'm not scared of ralph lauren . those are < u > sheets</u > .   are you gross under there ?   are you < u > night of the</u > < u > living dead</u > under there ?   like all bloody veins and pus ? 
a ... are you the guys who 're hiding out in the attic ? 
it was gross . they wanted me to dissect a frog . i told them no way .   i said it was against my religion .   i got a c. 
step ... mother . 
life is just ... too awful . 
i want to be dead too . 
he said if i let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you . 
i hate you !   i ca n't trust anybody ! 
i do n't wear that stuff to < u > bed</u > . besides there 's < u > nothing</u > wrong with it .   i 'm getting out of here . 
funeral .   god you guys < u > really are</u > < u > dead</u > !   what was it like ?   the funeral . did you cry ? 
i always tell the truth .   of course i can see you . 
you 're not gross .   why were you wearing a sheet ? 
your qu ... ?   but you 're ... 
w ... what is it ? 
... i will . 
you 've got to help them . 
they 'd look silly on me .   i 'm fourteen years old ! 
no i do n't .   i do n't take orders from smurfs . 
you were the snake !   right ?   i know .   i saw you . 
god you 're anatomically correct ! 
your name is < u > beetle juice</u > ?   yecch ! that 's as bad as < u > deee</u > lia < u > deee</u > tz . 
i am < u > not</u > !   beetle ... juice ? 
breakfast beetle ?   beetle ?   beetle fruit ?   fruit bat ?   fruit battle ? volkswagen ?   fruit wagon ? 
i do n't know what that signal means . 
your fingers are so small i ca n't see them .   first word -- two syllables . 
three syllables . 
i ... i do n't know what your name is . 
well it ca n't be any worse than my life here . 
i think so . 
i want to get in . 
are you a spirit too ? 
where 'd they go ? 
of course they 're dead .   they 're ghosts . 
mr. and mrs. maitland ?   i 've come for the last time .   where are you ?   barb ... 
they 're ... not here anymore . 
i ca n't < u > bring</u > the ghosts .   they 're not here ! 
i can not believe this . 
come on .   leave their stuff alone . 
listen you guys .   these ghosts are really nice people .   i think we scared them off .   let 's just leave them alone .   okay ? 
they 're ghosts .   they do what they want . 
< u > this is not a joke</u > !   that sheet was full of ghosts . 
well this is ... i mean this is the weirdest -- 
stepmother 's ... 
dad .   do you believe me ? 
well i just wanted to tell you what i saw . 
i 'm lonely . 
i was just trying to open the door .   mrs. butterfield brought over a skeleton key . 
stepmother .   she 's out torturing the movers . 
yeah maybe if he 's nice he 'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn . 
my whole life is a darkroom !   one ... big ... dark ... room . 
delia hates it . 
i 'm sorry already . 
shhhh .   they did n't commit suicide . 
i think the reason is they were trying to scare you and you did n't get scared -- 
it was n't a joke . 
i saw some ghosts . 
i < u > told</u > them you were too mean to be afraid . 
any particular kind ? 
i say let 's keep it the way it is . 
i plan to have a stroke from the amount of msg that 's in this food . 
it 's okay .   how 's the dirt business ? 
yes but i 'm going to live at home . 
is this the key to the attic ? 
what happened to the people who used to live here ? 
< u > adam</u > !   < u > adam</u > ! 
their wedding clothes . 
wait a minute !   what am i worried about ?   otho you ca n't even change a tire ! 
that 's slavery and murder .   you do n't know these people .   they 're just like you and me .   they 're nice people ! 
the attic . 
they do n't want to come down . 
otho that 's terrible . 
hold your breath and we 'll pull . 
not these people !   they are ruthless ! 
i think she 's in with them . 
just do n't tell lydia . 
otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration . 
otho'll know what to do . 
i feel like we 've been at war charles . 
lydia at your age you are < u > so</u > < u > young</u > .   charles we need to call that awful jane butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door .   ca n't you find a way to hold back some of her commission ? 
i ca n't believe that we 're eating cantonese .   is there no szechuan up here ?   hunan ? 
it 's < u > otho</u > ! 
lydia i will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors .   you help us with these ghosts or you 'll be sorry . 
it does n't matter .   what matters is i 've got a roomful of guests down there who think i 'm a fraud .   i am going to teach you something here lydia .   you 've < u > got</u > to take the right tone in things like this or people -- whether they 're dead or alive -- people will walk all < u > over</u > you .   come on out or i will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never < u > lived</u > ! 
all right you dead people !   come on out or we 'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with ! 
of < u > course</u > we were n't scared .   just a little startled .   one of those sushi dropped down my kamali . 
tried to convince me that this house is haunted .   kids .   kids . kids !   i love them . 
lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon . 
do n't you < u > dare</u > . 
do n't you < u > dare</u > talk to others about me .   i 'm an < u > artist</u > !   the only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends .   do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of connecticut ? not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone . 
i ca n't believe you are doing this to me !   < u > ghosts</u > .   i am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight .   otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic .   my agent bernard is bringing some woman who writes for < u > architectural digest</u > .   in fact no one here tonight has not been in < u > vanity fair</u > .   except you . 
joke !   joke !   aspirin !   it does n't matter what brand . 
< u > you jerks</u > !   that is my art and it is < u > dangerous</u > !   you think i want to die like that ?   lydia .   moving is a family affair . so buckle down now and go get mommy some drugs . 
we 'll be < u > the</u > art center of summer new york .   i 'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture .   and when otho and i get through with this house you people are not going to recognize it . 
this is our first meal in this house lydia .   why do n't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one ? 
what 's happening to them ? 
are they still here otho ? 
look at the tiny figures . 
it does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in < u > sheets</u > ! 
she 's been without therapy up here and i will not allow her to ruin ... 
< u > no</u > !   do not encourage this little ... person . 
probably the world 's largest < u > reader's</u > < u > digest</u > collection !   c'm on let 's have some chablis otho i 'm laid bare by this experience .   entirely bare . 
maybe charles does . 
attic space . 
that 's charles ' study .   but you do n't have to even look in there . he 'll love whatever you do to it .   he 's such a sheep . 
otho i can < u > not</u > < u > live</u > with these cheap domestic floor tiles . 
< u > oh my god</u > ! 
of course her favorite color ! how < u > beautiful</u > ! 
viridian ?   what is ... ? 
what do you think ? 
< u > i know</u > ... i read your book < u > the</u > < u > haunted tapestries of the waldorf</u > . 
what 's wrong ? 
the rest of the house is probably worse .   when can you and i get started ? 
i 'm < u > so</u > glad you could leave the city to consult me otho . 
i know robert ... but strangely enough i do n't feel too bad about now ... i feel all right ... i guess it 's easier ... knowing chauncey is here ... to take care of things ... 
no more robert ... no more needles ... 
in a minute robert - in a minute ... chauncey i would like to ask a favor of you ... 
we have common foes chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician ! 
... no of course you do n't . excuse me for being so presumptuous . no man knows everything about another man - however very few are honest enough to admit it . 
of course ! by kid - lawyers ! 
i know exactly what you mean . today the businessman is at the mercy of kid - lawyers from the sec . all they want to do is regulate our natural growth ! it 's happening across the country ! 
... i 've worked very hard and enjoyed my life ... i 've known success ... and i 've felt love ... my associates chauncey - i 've talked with them about you ... they 're eager to meet you ... very eager to meet you ... i 'm very fond of you chauncey ... and i understand eve ... tell her that ... tell her i 'm madly in love with her ... 
she cares for you and she needs your help chauncey ... there 's much to be looked after ... 
let me feel the strength in your hand chauncey ... let me feel your strength ...   yes that 's good ... i hope chauncey - i hope that you 'll stay with eve ... take care of her watch over her she 's a delicate flower chauncey ... 
... i 'm about to surrender the horn of plenty for the horn of gabriel my boy ... 
... chauncey ... chauncey ... 
good . together the two of you should create quite a stir - i can already hear the gossip . 
senator rowley 's widow sophie is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring ambassador skrapinov of the soviet union ... i think it 's rather obvious that robert wo n't allow me to attend so - would you go in my place and escort eve ? 
and now chauncey i 'm afraid you must excuse me - i 'm very tired all of a sudden . 
and please chauncey - do n't rush your decision . i know you 're not a man to act on the spur of the moment . 
oh sure you do the financial assistance program . i think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking . i 'd like you to meet with the members of the board we 'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time . 
... you know chauncey there 's something about you ... you 're direct you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly . you do n't play games with words to protect yourself . i feel i can speak to you frankly ... you know what i was talking to you about last night ? 
he was quite impressed with your comments chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone but yours unfortunately - seldom if ever at all . 
he 's a decent fellow the president is n't he ? 
i think what my most insightful friend is saying mr. president is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy . 
... maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position chauncey ... maybe one day ... 
yes when i was younger i had thoughts about public office ... but i found chauncey - that i was able to contribute more as a private citizen ... of course my wealth provided me with considerable influence but i 've tried believe me not to misuse that power ... it 's extremely important chauncey when one is in a position of eminence that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country ... the temptations are strong and i 've been labeled a ' kingmaker ' by many but i have tried to stay open to voices of the people ... i have tried to remain honest to myself ... 
no one likes a dying man my boy - because few know what death is . all we know is the terror of it . but you 're an exception chauncey - that 's what i admire in you your marvelous balance . you do n't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you 're a truly peaceful man . 
hah ! it 's all make - up chauncey ... i asked nurse teresa to fix me up i did n't want the president to think i was going to die during our talk . 
well that 's good news my boy . 
chauncey up and around this morning are you ? 
... oh ?   robert take a look would you ? 
reluctant to speak eh chauncey ? well i can understand that . when a man loses everything anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time . just give it some thought work with the idea i 'm sure you 'll have plenty to say in a few days . 
yes i 'm sure it is . that 's what they say anyway . 
now wait a minute chauncey you are young you are healthy for god 's sake do n't give up on yourself ! you have to fight ! you ca n't let those bastards keep you down ! i do n't want to hear any more from you about the ' room upstairs ' . that 's where i 'm going soon . 
a gardener ! well put chauncey excellent ! is n't that what a businessman is ? a gardener ? a person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands who waters it with the sweat from his own brow and who creates a place of value for his family and community ? yes chauncey what a brilliant metaphor -- yes indeed a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard . 
do we have a garden ? hah ! tomorrow chauncey you will see our gardens . 
and i 'm ben . 
that 's good mr. gardiner . or may i call you chauncey ? 
what 'd i tell you ? kid - lawyers ! the s.e.c. ! damn them ! 
oh . when you say ' your house has been closed ' you mean to say that your business was shut down ? 
... so am i my boy - so am i. 
... you will join us for dinner wo n't you mr. gardiner ? 
... we 're prisoners mr. gardiner - we 're prisoners of tubes and technology . 
failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells ... not a damn thing they can do about it . oh they can make me comfortable prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions ... and what makes my blood boil what little i have left that is mr. gardiner - is that it 's generally a young person 's disease ... here i am getting on in years and about to die of a young person 's disease ... 
sure you do . this ward is air tight i have a little extra oxygen pumped in keeps my spirits up . 
welcome to rand memorial hospital mr. gardiner . 
... thank you chauncey ... thank you very much .   ... all right robert i 'm all yours . 
that 's good ... that 's good . 
i 'm becoming quite attached to chauncey - quite attached ...   ... and so are you are n't you eve . 
do you need a secretary ? 
hah ! ... tell me the truth eve - if i wait until i feel better will i ever meet the man ? 
reasonable ? good i 'd like to meet a reasonable man . why do n't you ask this gardiner to join us for dinner ? 
i may be a shut - in but i do not lack for news . i 'm sorry you had to go through all that . 
no it 's been a good day - better than yours from what i 've been told . 
tired ... and i 'm getting tired of being so tired . other than that i 'm doing very well . 
you take care too bobby . 
you 're right mr. president i do n't like feeling sorry for myself . 
nonsense mr. president - i thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man . 
no she flew up to boston for another charity event . she 'll be sorry to have missed you . 
i 'm afraid so . 
... there is no longer any margin for inflation it has gone as far as it can you 've reached your limits on taxation dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis and from where i see it mr. president the free enterprise system has reached the breaking point . we are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible . 
i sympathize with your position mr. president i know how difficult it is to be straightforward the reaction to such a speech could be chaos . 
overall - pretty good . but mr. president i think it 's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game . 
yes i did . 
mr. president i 'd like you to meet my dear friend mr. chauncey gardiner . 
i 'm not convinced of that mr. president but your visit has raised my spirits ... 
... mr. president how good to see you . 
i do - we do - both of us ben and i feel so much for chauncey ... 
we have to find him robert - he could be lost something may have happened we ca n't leave him ! 
i wish he were here ... 
... do you think we should look for him ? 
chauncey is so sensitive ... he was overcome with grief ... 
... but he 's ... ? 
good . it might be pleasant for a couple of days .   ... robert ... is there any improvement ... ? 
he 's very intense and internal do n't you think ? 
yes he is different ... not the kind of person one usually meets in washington . 
stay here ? is that necessary ? 
i wanted some fresh air robert . how is mr. gardiner ? 
oh chauncey darling ... where have you been ? we thought we 'd lost you - we 've been looking all over ! 
chauncey ! chauncey ! 
dearest you uncoil my wants ; desire flows within me and when you watch me my passion dissolves it . you set me free . i reveal myself to myself and i am drenched and purged . 
... but i 've never done ...   ... you mean ... ? when ... when ... when i do it ? ... when i touch myself ... ? 
... is that all you want ... ?   ... to watch me ... ? 
to watch ... ? to watch me ... ? 
i just do n't excite you at all ... i do n't know what you want ... i do n't know what you like ... 
... come in chauncey - please come in ... 
i feel so close to you so safe with you chauncey ...   ... and benjamin understands that dearest ... he understands and accepts my feelings for you ... 
it must be the punch and it is stuffy in here -- i feel it a little myself . you 're an angel my dear - thank god there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort . 
upstairs ? chauncey you 're always involved in some sort of discussion ... 
chauncey where have you been ? i was afraid you got bored and left or that you were with some mysterious woman . 
chauncey this is mr. dennis watson of the state department . 
i 've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you chauncey . you 're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it . 
... i guess i may as well be honest about my feelings chauncey as i know you are i am in love with you ... i love you and i want you ... and i know that you know it and i 'm grateful that you 've decided to wait until ... until ... 
i know you are chauncey ...   ... you conquer a woman from within herself you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love . 
... i 'm grateful to you chauncey ... i would have opened to you with a touch and you know that ...   ... but you 're so strong - i can trust myself with you . i 'm glad chauncey - i 'm glad that you showed so much restraint ... 
... you know chauncey ... i want us to be ...   i want us ... you and i to become ... close ... i want us to become very close you know ... ? 
i know ...   ... so are you chauncey ...   ... do you mind my being here like this ? 
well it seems you 've been described as one of the architects of the president 's speech . and your own comments from the ' this evening ' show are quoted side by side with the president 's . 
chauncey ! have you seen the papers ? 
... good night chauncey . 
... i have very few friends chauncey ... and benjamin 's friends are all quite a bit older ... 
oh . well we can fix up one of ben 's for you tomorrow night . sophie insists an black tie . 
... you do n't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase do you ? 
i know you do - you and your television ...   ... good luck chauncey . 
he 's tired chauncey - but he 's going to watch you tonight . we 'll both be watching . 
and benjamin sends along his best wishes . 
chauncey i just wanted to wish you well . i know you 'll be smashing . 
i 'll be all right chauncey you go ahead with mrs. aubrey ... 
... i 'm ...   ... i 'm very grateful that you 're here chauncey ...   ... with us ... 
yes so do we . 
our greenhouse . 
of course . 
oh his maid ! ... stupid me i thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with . 
i 'm sorry ...   ... and what about louise ? you mentioned that she had gone were you close to her also ? 
forgive me chauncey - i did n't mean to pry . you must have been very close to him . 
oh i see ... your mentor perhaps ? 
was he a relative ? or an intimate friend ? 
... chauncey ... last night you mentioned an old man that died . 
yes he is . i 'm sorry i did n't get to see him . 
good . i 'm glad to hear that .   ... how did you like meeting the president ? 
your leg must be getting better . 
... good night chauncey . 
... why ... no i do n't think so ... 
he does ... ? 
yes ... i know chauncey . 
... and ben is just mad about you - you 've lifted his spirits so - it 's just ... well it 's just a real pleasure having you with us . 
chauncey i wanted to tell you how dreadful i feel about the accident today but that i 'm delighted that you are staying with us . 
oh i know exactly what you mean . i sometimes enjoy puttering around myself such a pleasant way to forget one 's troubles . 
i hope that staying here wo n't be an inconvenience for you . 
... would you like us to notify anyone for you ? 
wo n't your injury prevent you from attending to business mr. gardiner ? 
i admire that in a person . as for myself i find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times ... 
i can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events . 
... i 'll feel so relieved after dr. allenby examines your leg . after that david can run you on home or to your office or wherever you 'd prefer ...   ... is there anything special you would like to watch ? 
oh ... well i 'm very sorry ... 
did you lose something ? 
oh . well they 're just a wonderful couple we 've been friends for years . we visit their island quite often . 
oh ... mr. gardiner ... mr. chauncey gardiner ... you 're not related to basil and perdita gardiner are you ? 
pardon me was that mr. chance ? 
may i ask your name ? 
oh by the way - i 'm eve rand . 
oh ? certainly ... 
would you care for a drink ? 
fine it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you ...   david we 'll just go on home . jeffrey would you call and let them know ? 
yes . my husband has been very ill . his doctor and nurses are staying with us . those hospitals can be so impersonal - why it might be hours before you are treated ... 
i see .   ... say would you mind seeing our family doctor ? 
... why yes he is ... is your leg feeling any better ? 
these can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to - do over a simple little accident . of course they can be very frightening and i must apologize for david he 's never had an accident before . 
i hope you 're comfortable . 
why there certainly is . you must see a doctor i insist on it . please let us take you . 
... wo n't you let us do something for you ? your leg should be examined we could take you to a hospital . 
... ben really ... 
... yes i am ben . 
oh . i 'm very sorry . well if you have any need for any of our facilities please do not hesitate to ask . 
do you feel well enough for that ? 
oh it was n't all that bad darling . we were fortunate that mr. gardiner turned out to be so reasonable . 
you heard ? 
no headaches ? 
oh ben - i miss you so when i 'm out ... how are you feeling ? 
i 'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg mr. gardiner . 
thank you greta .   i 'll be with mr. rand if i 'm needed . 
thank you wilson . that will be fine . 
good evening wilson . 
would you two excuse me for a moment ? 
chauncey this is mrs. sophia rowley . 
sophie this is chauncey gardiner ... 
hello sophie . 
you 're gon na need somebody someone 's got ta be around for you boy ...   ... you oughta find yourself a lady chance ...   but i guess it oughta be an old lady 'cause you ai n't gon na do a young one any good not with that little thing of yours ...   ... you 're always gon na be a little boy ai n't you ?   ... goodbye chance ... 
... well ai n't you the gentleman this mornin ' ...   ... got ta go now chance ...

oh lord chance - i do n't know what i was expectin ' from you ... i 'm sorry for yellin ' like i did ... no sir i just do n't know what i was expectin ' ...   ... i ' spose i 'd better gather up some breakfast for you ... 
well ai n't that the truth ... 
dammit boy ! is that all you got to say ? more gobbledegook ?   that old man 's layin ' up there dead as hell and it just do n't make any difference to you ! 
then i got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and i think i woke him probably he was n't any too alert . he just said ' yeah he 's been expectin ' it and said he 'd send somebody over ... ' lord what a mornin ' ! 
must of happened durin ' the night i do n't know ... lord he was n't breathin ' and as cold as a fish . i touched him just to see and you believe me chance - that 's doin' more than i get paid to do ... then i just covered him up pulled the sheet over his head ... 
he 's dead chance ! the old man 's dead ! 
... back up those stairs - damn ... that man 's needin ' me more and more just before he never needs me again ... 
i 'm afraid he 's slippin ' a bit with every hour that goes by ... 
... the old man is getting weaker chance . 
... evening chance . 
sure . we could really use a farmer . we 'd be grateful for the help .   also i think you know if you would n't mind too terribly a little puppet show every once in a while would do a lot to lift our spirits . you know if you would n't mind too terribly . 
i know . 
people make mistakes . 
i do n't know . there 's a small community of us . we have a place they do n't know about . we 're happy . we 'll keep trying to figure out a way . come stay with us . join the struggle . 
you saw it once . now you see it again . that 's life is n't it ? and you were up here to try the same thing were n't you ? 
yeah . i was going to kill him from the inside . 
it 's okay craig . it all worked out in an odd sort of way . 
a better friend . 
the monkey . 
it 's elijah . 
i 'm in love . for the first time . it 's funny but when it happens to you there 's no question . 
my god ! 
you 're not a monster craig . just a confused man . 
i need a shower . 
maybe this is what you 've always been craig you just never faced it before . 
you did n't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she would n't let you near her with a ten foot pole which is by the way about nine feet nine inches off the mark anyway . 
you fell in love with her first . 
once this was a relationship based on love . now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head . 
what 's that ? 
it 'll never happen fuckface . 
what the hell darling . close early today live dangerously . 
you bastard . 
suck my dick ! 
i 'm your goddamn wife . once you vowed to cherish me forever . now you hold a gun to my head ? 
sometimes we 're forced to make hard decisions .   i 'd like for us to stay together craig . you know platonically if that 's possible . i truly value our friendship . 
i 'm sorry . that was nasty . 
well you have the maxine action figure to play with . 
me and john . 
we love her craig . i 'm sorry . 
fuck maxine . 
us of course . 
i 'm giving them up . i 've changed . i 've found a new focus . 
you 've always hated the animals . 
i 'm getting rid of the animals . i 've lost interest . besides they 're standing between you and me . 
i 'm getting rid of the fucking animals . 
nothing . do n't go craig . i 've been thinking . let 's try to work this out . we 've got so much history . 
what are you doing ? 
did you know that eskimos have not one but fifty words for snow . it 's because they have so much of it . 
it 'll be okay . i 'll fix my lasagna . well smoke a joint .   tensions will melt away . 
you 're right . you know i was thinking that we should have maxine over for dinner . since you two are partners and all . it might be a nice gesture . 
oh you know not a lot . just hanging around his apartment . i think he must be a lonely man . 
do n't crowd me craig . 
i have to go back tonight . at eight exactly . 
everything felt right for the first time . i need to go back to make sure then if the feeling is still there . i 'm going to speak to dr. feldman about sexual reassignment surgery . 
i 've been going over and over my experience last night . it was amazing .   i 've decided i 'm a transsexual . is n't that the craziest thing ? 
fuck pets . is this your partner ? i had to come back and do the malkovich ride again . fuck everything else . is this her ? 
i was was n't i ?   i was john fucking malkovich !   take me back craig . 
i have to go back craig . being inside did something to me . all of a sudden everything made sense . i knew who i was . 
i have to go back now . 
i have to go back . 
i 'm scared . 
i want to be john malkovich . tomorrow morning . plus i 'd like to meet this partner of yours . 
i want to try . 
do n't be ridiculous . there is no such thing as a portal into someone else 's brain . 
' kay . 
no thanks . i 'm going to turn in . 
i dressed the wound . then i 've just been feeding everyone putting everyone to bed . 
the iguana . 
tom - tom 's puncture wound is infected . 
i was worried . 
did you eat ? 
she 's very beautiful . 
some sort of childhood trauma she thinks . possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp . interesting huh ? 
they 'll understand . besides i 've got a morning appointment tomorrow with elijah 's shrink . we 're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach . 
seven - ish 
is n't that cute ? i just taught her that . 
why craig . why ? 
why 'd you do it craig ? 
is the trial date set ? 
the monkey . 
would you check in on elijah ? he seems to be a little under the weather this morning . 
craig everyone ca n't be derek mantini .   well grub worms are waiting . do me a favor ? 
well you know maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around . 
craig listen honey i 've been thinking ... maybe you 'd feel better if you got you know a job or something . 
got ta run . shipment of grub worms coming in first thing . 
i 'll be with you always my friends . who knows maybe if i 'm lucky i 'll rejoin you with wings and a beak . 
hush sweetheart . 
yes . i 'm the only one . i have to enter malkovich and destroy him from the inside . if not me who ? 
i 'm glad you learned sign language elijah but i 'm tired of your nagging . i 'm tired of this conversation . i 'm tired period . what has the world ever done for me that i should feel personally responsible for saving it ? 
that bastard ! i 'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order son of malkovich . 
why not ? i need to get in there ! 
it 's craig in there i can tell . 
you bastard ! 
no i did n't know that . 
no you do n't understand . i 've been inside malkovich when i 'm with maxine ... 
craig stole maxine from me dr. lester . 
but now we 've lost access to craig . 
i blew it dr. lester . 
but why son of malkovich ? 
i 'm getting divorced . 
dr. lester would you point me toward the restroom ? 
yes of course dr. lester . 
but maxine i thought it was me you loved . 
maxine ! listen :   it has n't been me in john the last three times . craig 's had me locked up in the apartment . he made me call you at gunpoint . it 's been him ! oh god it 's been him ! 
we have to meet . 
i have to see you . 
oh my darling . oh my sweetheart . 
give me one hour to get inside him exactly . 
i have to see you . can you call him and invite us over ? 
after that i 'll introduce you to my favorite monkey elijah . he 's got an ulcer due to a suppressed childhood trauma . but we 're getting to the bottom of it .   psychotherapy . 
i 've never been looked at like this by a woman . 
do n't stand in the way of my actualization as a man craig . 
hi . have you done malkovich yet ? 
yes hi . 
j.m. inc. be all that someone ... 
how the hell would i know ? i was n't a philosophy major . 
let him try . 
lotte ? is that you ? 
lotte this is so good ... 
a girl has a right to glow if she wants . it 's in the fucking constitution . 
do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes ? no i do n't suppose you would . it 's quite a thrill craig . 
you picked the unrequited variety . very bad for the skin . 
i 've fallen in love . 
you 're late . 
so unbolt the fucking door einstein . 
craig i just do n't find you attractive . and lotte i 'm smitten with you but only when you 're in malkovich . when i looked into his eyes last night i could feel you peering out . behind the stubble and the too - prominent brow and the male pattern baldness i sensed your feminine longing peering out and it just slew me . 
okay . here it is .   ever want to be someone else ? now you can . no kidding . only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes . visit j.m. inc. mertin - flemmer building . etc . etc . 
i 'll protect you dollface . 
sure . it 'd be fun . 
fine . i 'll do it myself . i was going to offer a partnership to you but this way it 's more money for me . 
exactly . two hundred dollars a pop . 
good . we 'll sell tickets . 
is this malkovich fellow appealing ? 
what 's he been in ? 
sounds delightful . who the fuck is john malkovich ? 
it better be . 
you might want to check those tarot cards one more time . 
you 're not someone i could get interested in . craig . you play with dolls . 
so tell me about yourself . if you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough dog - boy . 
good . now we 're getting somewhere .   not a chance . 
i mean i am really attracted to you . jesus you are a fag . we can share recipes if you like darlene . 
you 're a fag or a liar . 
dont let the girly shit fool you . it 'd blow your shorts off . 
christ you 're not a fag are you ? because i do n't want to be wasting my time . 
my tits ? 
the usual barry . 
you married ? 
i am dubious but i do n't welsh . meet me at the stuck pig . seven o'clock . you 're late i walk . so help me if i find out you cheated . 
somebody told you . 
who told you ? 
who told you ? 
why not ? 
you know if you ever got me you would n't have a clue what to do with me . that 's the thing romeo . 
and fifty other lines to get into a girl 's pants . 
yes well ... 
i would n't know . 
how dreary - to be - somebody / how public - like a frog / to tell one 's name - the livelong june / to an admiring bog ! 
well truth is for suckers is n't it ? . 
yes . unfortunately it 's bullshit . the real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors . 
two hundred dollars please . 
you can be john malkovich . 
no . do n't be an ass . 
i thought so too doll . i guess we were mistaken . 
really ? well you know he 's quite good . i 'm surprised . anyway i have a session with malkovich i have to attend . i 'll speak with you soon . 
one hour . 
sweetie ! oh but we ca n't . it 's business hours . i need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers . 
j.m. inc. be all that someone else can be . 
i love you lotte . 
and the funny thing is . mr. malkovich my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me . 
yes hello i wanted to place an ad .   hi are you craig 's wife ? 
yeah what ? ! 
perhaps you 'll want to consult that ouija board again . 
you 've got to be kidding . 
bad dream darling ? 
busy day my little fire chief . why do n't you climb into bed and i 'll meet you there in just ... 
oh darling . it 's a dream come true . we 're going to ride this straight to the top . 
does n't he know how important tonight is to us ? 
this is it lover . you 're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto - change - o you 're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen . 
it 's okay my sweet . 
oh craiggy that 's brilliant ! 
no one would ever have to know its not him . 
well we 'll have all the money in malkovich 's bank account plus he still gets acting work occasionally . 
stay in him forever ? 
you 're right my darling it 's so much more . it 's playing with people ! 
that was incredible . you 're brilliant ! 
i 'd love to see your work . 
wow .   do a puppet show for me craig honey . 
you still there sweets ? 
i 'll say you are . let 's do it on his kitchen table then make him eat an omelette off of it . 
apparently you can control this malkovich fellow now . 
lotte called me . 
oh shut up .   craig darling are you in there ? 
i can explain about the portal darling . 
oh dollface it was just your passion for me taking hold . 
oh lotte ... 
oh my sweet beautiful lotte . 
do you mind ? 
so do you enjoy being an actor ? 
thanks so much for coming over . 
whatever you 're having . 
it 's just that i fantasize about you and well speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and ... 
you do n't know me but i 'm a great admirer of yours . 
mr. malkovich ? 
know it and go on out the yard . go on . 
there ai n't . 
you got to go sometime . you got to go out there by yourself sometime . 
why you never go back to lady jone 's and learn your letters ? you liked going there i remember . seeing the other children . then all a sudden you stop . 
no . i 'm looking for what i was put here to look for : the back door . 
what i know is what i see : a nigger woman hauling shoes . 
was a time i knew what was . 
not like he punished me . 
i 'm saying they came into my yard . 
i 'm saying they came into my yard . 
those white things have taken all i had or dreamed . i 'm saying ai n't no bad luck in this world ' cept for white folks .. they just do n't know when to stop . 
no stamp . i ai n't . 
ca n't say . it 's something ca n't be planned . 
i likes yellow . 
blue . that does n't hurt nobody . yellow neither . 
what i have to do is get in my bed and lay down . i want to fix on something harmless in this world . 
that 's the last thing they took from me . 
if i call them and they come what on earth am i going to say to them . 
well what ? 
i got a delivery around here . name of tucker . 
folks come . folks go . 
those boys did n't even know him . you had six whole years of marriage to my halle fathered every one of your children . a blessing . i learned hard that a man 's just a man but a son like that ... like halle .. now that 's somebody . 
oh i remember bits and pieces of all of'em i guess .. halle of course .. i had halle a lifetime . almost twenty years ... my two girls sold and gone before i could even a heard about it and them without their grown up teeth yet . my third child my son after halle ... i let that straw boss have me for four months so 's i could keep that boy . next year he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child . i could n't love that child . i would n't . not any of the rest either . god take what he would .... and he did ... 
what 'd be the point ? not a house in the country ai n't packed to the rafters with some dead negro 's grief . we lucky our ghost is a baby . my husband spirit come back ? or yours ? do n't talk to me ! ha .. you lucky . you got one child left still pullin at your skirts . be thankful . i had eight . eight with six fathers . every one of them gone from me . four taken four chased and all i expect worrying somebody 's house into evil . my first born - alls i can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread . her little hands .. i would n't know'em if they slapped me . can you beat that ? eight children and that 's all i remember . 
they 'll be all right . i 'm surprised they lasted here this long . 
ah winter in ohio is especially rough if you 've got an appetite for color . 
then what do i do ? 
but you said ... you said out there there ai n't no ... what was that word? .. no .. de- fense . no de - fense . 
there was a boy there ... said mama was a jailbird ... said he could prove it .. 
you best leave that quilt alone . that was grandma 's quilt . 
the whitefolk ? 
watch out for her ; she can give you dreams . 
i will protect you . 
beloved .. she 's mine        i am beloved 
.. i swallowed her blood right along with my mother 's milk . she played with me and always came to be with me whenever i needed her . me and her waited for our daddy . i love her . i do . she never hurt me . i love my mother but i know she killed one of her own and tender as she is with me i 'm scared of her because of it . all the time i 'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own could happen again . whatever it is it comes from outside this house outside the yard . so i never leave this house and i watch over the yard so it ca n't happen again ... i have to keep it away from my sister ... i'll protect beloved ... 'cause she 's mine ... 
and paul d ... you do n't have to stay ' way but be careful how you talk to my mama hear ? 
thank you . 
i do n't . i have my own . 
at times . at other times i think she was ... more . but who would know that better than you . i mean you sure ' nough you her . 
have n't seen her since that day . ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but .. i do n't think so . mama thinks she 's gone for good . says she can feel it . 
i do n't know . i think i 've lost my mother paul d. 
no . not a bit all right . has n't gotten out of bed since that day . 
more than all right . miss bodwin she teach me stuff .. book stuff . she says i might go to oberlin . she 's experimenting on me . 
no . got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory . figure between that and my night work at the bodwins i might be able to put something away for me and mama . 
do n't pay to complain . 
they good whitefolks ? 
in case of what ? 
fine . but what would i do at night ? 
ya think ? 
i miss her . 
yes ma'am . 
yes ma'am .. 
yes ma'am . 
i 'm looking for work . i was thinking they might know of some . 
i want to see mr. and mrs. bodwin . 
may i come in ? 
no .. no that wo n't do ... 
food . my mama she does n't feel well . i could n't stay away from her too long cause of her condition but i could do chores in the mornings . 
i ca n't do anything but i would learn it for you if you have a little extra . 
no . i mean work work . 
i want to work miss lady . 
but you 'll hurt your eyes doin it there . come sit at the table . 
mama ... mama she 's asleep . why do n't you eat something . 
mama let me help you . 
but mama .. 
morning ma'am . 
daddy is coming for us . 
don't love her too much . 
wo n't you be late for work ? 
she likes to see you off in the morning . 
should i wake her ? 
that was fun . 
ooh yeah ... don't know if it 's the floor or the skating . 
oh yeah . they good . ca n't say they ai n't good . i would n't trade them for another pair tell you that . but you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it . all right ? 
in case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad i ca n't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after . anything .   do n't ask me what whitefolks need at night . 
be here . in case . 
they getting older now and i ca n't take care of 'em like i used to . more and more they keep asking me to sleep over night . now i do n't want to quit these people but they ca n't have all my days and nights too . i got my own family needs me . it 'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day then earn a little something at night how 's that ? 
bet you do . everybody miss her . that was a good woman ... well i do n't know whether the bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help . 
i never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me . always . never be another like her . 
you know what ? i 've been here since i was fourteen and i remember like yesterday when baby suggs holy came here and sat right where you are . whiteman name of garner brought her . he and mr. bodwin were good friends . that 's how she got that house you all live in . other things too . 
well come on in . you letting in flies . 
i heard your mother took sick that so ? 
you baby sugg 's kin ai n't you ? 
what you want'em for ? 
miss bodwin . they brother and sister darlin . 
what you want ? 
you know as well as i do stamp that people who die bad do n't stay in the ground . 
well paul d. must know who she is . or what she is . 
but you did n't come here talking 'bout paul . you came asking about a new girl . 
and he left when he found out what sethe did ?   what you say casts a different light on it i guess ... i thought- 
he knew baby suggs ? 
you did n't tell me that . i thought he already knew . 
what run him off ? tell me that ! 
i ai n't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children . 
till she showed herself . 
anything white floating around in the woods - if it do n't got a shotgun it 's something the lord tells me i do n't want no part of . 
i ai n't sure i know that . baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here . and how 'd she make it and her husband did n't ? and where is he ? and how she have that baby in the woods by herself ? said a whitewoman help her . shoot . you believe that ? well i know what kind of white that was . 
well who can tell what went on in there ? i never even knew who sethe was or none of her people . 
hold on ! do n't jump if you ca n't see bottom ! 
her who ? 
stamp do n't tear me up this morning ! i do n't feel like it . 
i do n't know him that well . 
he ask i give him anything . 
unrile yourself stamp . it 's only a few days he been there . 
ca n't nobody read minds long distance . all he have to do is ask somebody . 
yeah . asked rev. pike if he could stay in the cellar . 
he 's sleeping in the church . 
better ask paul d. 
might see anything at all at 124 . 
you sure ? 
ai n't no new negroes in this town i do n't know about . what she look like ? you sure that was n't denver ? 
what you want there ? somebody invite you in ? 
out where ? 
where you been keeping yourself ? i told john must be cold if stamp stay inside . 
exactly .   what happened to your face ? did jackie treehorn do that as well ? 
look jeffrey i do n't want a partner . in fact i do n't want the father to be someone i have to see socially or who 'll have any interest in rearing the child himself . 
i want a child . 
well yes what did you think this was all about ?   fun and games ? 
he helps administer the charities now and i give him a reasonable allowance .   he has no money of his own .   i know how he likes to present himself ; father 's weakness is vanity . hence the slut . 
we did let father run one of the companies briefly but he did n't do very well at it . 
no no the wealth was all mother 's . 
i keep telling you it 's the foundation 's money .   father does n't have any . 
it 's not my father 's money it 's the foundation 's .   why did he think you had it ?   and who does ? 
finder 's fee ? 
what happened to your house ? 
what do you do for fun ? 
uh - huh . 
uh - huh . 
tell me a little about yourself jeffrey . 
i want you to see him immediately . 
please jeffrey .   i do n't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects . 
do you still have that doctor 's number ? 
so dieter has the money ? 
look jeffrey you do n't really kidnap someone that you 're acquainted with .   you ca n't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are . 
is he pretending to be the abductor ? 
huh ?   autobahn .   a - u - t - o.   their music is a sort of -- ugh -- techno - pop . 
dieter has been on the fringes of-- well of everything in l.a. for about twenty years .   look at my lp 's . under ' autobahn . ' 
dieter hauff ? 
from who ? 
she is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim . 
and please do n't call her my mother . 
she most certainly was not ! 
do you have any news regarding my father 's money ? 
jeffrey you have n't gone to the doctor . 
please see him jeffrey .   he 's a good man and thorough . 
here 's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you .   you will receive no bill .   he 's a good man and thorough . 
--your rug yes well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that do n't have sentimental value for me . and i am sorry about that crack on the jaw . 
thousand yes bones or clams or whatever you call them . 
if you successfully do so i will compensate you to the tune of 1 % of the recovered sum . 
i 'm getting to your rug . my   father and i do n't get along ; he does n't approve of my lifestyle and needless to say i do n't approve of his . still i hardly wish to make my father 's embezzlement a police matter so i 'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to . 
do n't be fatuous jeffrey .   little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career 
lord .   you can imagine where it goes from here . 
take a look at this sir . 
yes mr. lebowski these unfortunate souls can not love in the true sense of the word .   our mutual acquaintance bunny is one of these . 
i like it too .   it 's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex . it can be a natural zesty enterprise . but unfortunately there are some people -- it is called satyriasis in men nymphomania in women -- who engage in it compulsively and without joy . 
you 're not interested in sex ? 
sex .   the physical act of love . coitus .   do you like it ? 
do you like sex mr. lebowski ? 
yes i know about it .   and i know that you acted as courier .   and let me tell you something :   the whole thing stinks to high heaven . 
thank you . 
in a sense yes .   elfranco my robe . my art has been commended as being strongly vaginal .   which bothers some men .   the word itself makes some men uncomfortable .   vagina . 
i want to see the sun rise . 
how does it look ? 
i do n't understand . 
you 're hurting me . 
well it 's in mine too .   i 'm a pureblood .   i was n't turned .   i was born this way .   just like you .   am i evil because i want to survive ?   what about a wolf ?   what about any predator ? 
why do you hate us so much ? 
if that 's true then why 'd you save me ? 
it does n't have to be like that .   we do n't have to be enemies . 
it would 've been easy for you to let me die back there today but you did n't . 
thank you . 
anyone else make it ? 
each day is a little life . 
blade .   we 've got six reapers .   they 're all dead . 
really ?   what are we supposed to do then ?   starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live ?   what about that scumbag you just let off the hook ? a nothing .   a drug - dealer .   how do you justify saving people like that ? 
he 's right about one thing .   we do have to survive . 
exactly .   look at the digestive system . it 's been drastically simplified .   super charged .   and this -- 
i 've never seen anything like this .   the reapers are as different from us as we are from you .   it 's almost as if the virus is re - wiring their bodies creating new parasitic organs which consume the old ones . 
if that 's true what about nomak ?   he 's been alive longer than the others . 
right .   so why is he dying ?   he does n't appear to have any broken bones no entry wounds of any kind -- what 's killing him ? 
from the surveillance footage in the bloodbank .   he was one of the guard 's nomak attacked . 
i did n't know . 
what about nomak ? 
you 're hurt . 
what was that ? 
we need it .   sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest .   tattoos piercings tribal scarring -- because we regenerate none of it 's permanent .   so we have to take it to the next level . to remind us we 're alive . 
this is our world you 're entering .   you may see things -- feeding .   just remember why you 're here . 
the house of pain . 
what the hell are you doing blade ? 
no .   they 've been training to hunt you . 
two years . 
you 're missing the point .   their vampire victims do n't die .   they turn .   they become carriers .   if the reapers continue unchecked there could be thousands of them before the month is over .   do the math . 
they tell bedtime stories about you . blade the big bad boogie - man .   frankly i 'm disappointed .   that you were willing to come along so easily i mean .   without any assurances . 
maybe it 's better that way . 
we 're locked in . 
you experimented on your own son ? 
nomak said something to blade in greek . athelfiki singenia ex amato .   where did he learn that ? 
his name is jared nomak . 
i never imagined i 'd be so happy to see the sun rise --   it 's over is n't it ? 
yes you will . the human side of you is stronger . i know it is . 
it 's the only way . you know that . we 'll never get out of here alive if you do n't . 
i know . take some of my blood . 
i 'm not leaving without you . 
it wo n't work on you . 
is it bad ? 
i do n't know . i woke up just before you did -- 
are you all right ? 
you make it sound like i 'm already dead . 
i 'm just tired that 's all . we 've been up all night . 
some . it 's been slow -- 
my mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart . 
you care about him do n't you ? 
is he sick ? 
i made a trip to the hospital last night borrowed some equipment . 
if you 're not human then why do you bleed like us ? i 've seen vampire blood you do n't have it running through your veins . 
those are n't real memories . no one has that kind of recall . 
it 's dark in here . 
what am i injecting you with ? 
you 're hurt -- 
is n't this all a little high - tech ? i thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins . 
what is this place ? 
like what ? 
so many of them -- i still ca n't believe they 're real . 
how can you tell ? 
you let him go --   an hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less this one did n't even talk . 
i know this place -- it 's a blood bank . 
what are you looking at ? 
you do n't know that . 
look if what you say is true if there 's a chance i could turn into one of them then i 've got no choice do i ? i have to work with you . i need to learn everything i can about them . it 's the only way i 'll be able to find a cure for myself . 
you ca n't do this he 's human it 's murder . 
what are you doing ? ! 
and that 's a good thing ? 
why in god 's name would anyone want to work for them ? 
but he 's a policeman -- 
but he could 've -- 
you used me as bait ? ! 
how did you know ? 
that 's ridiculous ! no one 's that powerful . 
i can go to the police . i have blood samples back at the hospital . i can show them . 
i ca n't just leave . i have a life here a career -- 
and you honestly expect me to believe all this ? 
what happens then ? 
you 're joking -- 
i 'm sorry i -- 
-- but then i remember what an ass - hole you were and i 'm snapped back to reality . 
you have n't started in on the internal organs ? 
i thought you promised to give me some distance ? 
curtis it 's three in the morning . i 'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes . 
the red blood cells are biconvex which is theoretically impossible . they 're hypochromic there 's virtually no hemoglobin in them .   look at the pmns they 're binucleated they should be mononucleated . 
i do n't know --   look at this blood smear -- 
this is n't human blood . 
get away from him ! 
you 're a monster . 
but you use blood banks -- 
there 's no need for any of this . your condition can be treated . whistler and i were working on a cure when -- 
what happens then ? 
how many of you are there ? 
what happened to the power ? 
on me yes . on blade i 'm not so sure --   the problem is blade did n't contract the vampire virus from a bite like i did . he was born with it . the irony is i could probably cure every vampire but him . 
with a retrovirus . it 's injected into the bone marrow cells it causes the host 's dna to mutate . they 've been using them to treat sickle - cell anemia . 
basically you 'd have to re - write the victim 's dna alter it so that the dna will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin . 
then vampirism is a genetic defect just like hemolytic anemia ? 
all right let 's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood ? 
i 'll take my chances . 
and now you 're using blade to exact your revenge ? 
how did you escape ? 
he killed them ? 
why do you hunt them ? 
no offense whistler but you 're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here . you might have missed something . 
what happens if he does n't take the serum ? 
why did n't you tell me the truth about him ? 
you 've been listening in the whole time ? 
so that 's it ? you guys just patch me up and send me on my way ? 
so what do you use then ? a stake ? 
who are you people ? 
what -- ? 
nick ! ! 
please ! please ... ? i have n't done anything . 
--my god nick ? ? ? 
i 'm not a witch you 're all crazy ! 
closer . lift the lid and look-- it hurts . 
my eye is there something in my eye ? 
do n't know -- just that she was afraid-- 
a coward too . that 's why she had to go . 
--bad boys mean boys < u > cowardly</u > boys -- just like domini . 
i don't ... i do n't understand them myself . 
join the club . 
because it means the tree is older than the house . 
--which she may have-- 
i just wanna go < u > home</u > . 
her father 's sheriff of taos county . 
inside the grave ? 
what 're you doing there ? 
--he 's not my husband ! 
--i'm not staying here ! 
something was wrong . 
i was out hiking camping the past two days -- that 's what did it--<u > i</u > killed it-- 
--nick ! ! 
i have n't killed any-- 
looks like business is booming . 
that 's a joke ? 
we 're ticketed to fly back from baltimore anyway . 
oh sorry right . 
not the only things missing nick . 
so whoever built this-- 
no . what 's it doing here in the middle of the foundation ? 
buried deep under 200 years worth of soil ash and compost layers . 
the witch 's voice . 
i dunno probably right up there based on her resume . 
no idea just talked to her on the ' net -- she 's very good . 
she e - mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her . 
guess they thought it was safe to put some up again . 
down or off -- you're giving me a migraine . 
--fine later fine . 
you feel no need to get married or anything . 
you do n't want it though . 
like how weirded - out you are with this pregnancy thing . 
you know nick you 've been something of a total asshole the past few days . 
it was < u > free</u>--i recall that was the chief selling point for you . 
oh < u > c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird . 
--<u > whoever</u>--they built an entire house < u > around</u > a < u > tree</u > . sticking up right through the living room . somebody like to explain that to me ? 
--do you < u > agree</u > it 's that < u > old</u > nick ? 
that 's a sapling--<u > this</u > mother 's got to be three hundred years old minimum . 
what is < u > this</u > ? 
you sure ? 
--doesn't just pop out of thin air . it spins off of real events . at some point there < u > was</u > a blair witch-- 
no the kids were actors the townspeople were real . her the sheriff the convenience store guy-- 
she < u > is</u>--she 's helped solve a bunch of murders : arizona new mexico-- 
domini . domini von teer . 
it 's like traveling back in time . 
bullshit ! talk ! 
--jamie kurth jonathan edmunds-- 
you killed domini did n't you witch ? ? 
not that i can see . 
what are you alright ? 
what happened to her where did she go ? 
what do you mean ? 
try please anna-- 
i need you to talk to me talk to me about the dreams -- about james the other boys . 
' give you a hand . i think my sleep for the night just ended . 
why do n't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings -- who < u > cares</u > ? 
--or incredibly fucking naive . 
--and if she ever did-- 
remember .... what mary brown said-- she could see the witch 's hands on my face her mouth sucking on mine . 
does n't say -- it 's just these pages . 
--i do n't trust anybody not even me anymore-- 
goes right along with these two . 
--one of us all of us -- i have no idea -- brought whatever this thing is back here . we 're not going to go out there and spread it around like typhoid mary . we 're gon na figure it out we 're gon na bring a goddamn < u > end</u > to it . 
nobody 's going anywhere-- 
--before you lose your emotional lunch .

--i saw what i saw . 
what the fuck-- ? ? 
it 's < u > freezing</u > . 
how 's she going to know where to-- 
boy kurth . 
you think it 's possible the tree in the parr foundation is the same one they tied elly kedward to ? 
--cotter where can i get on - line ? 
same trees . they took elly kedward out to the same kind of trees . 
well she got out of here < u > some</u>- how because she 's not here ! !

we should be so lucky . 
try a long walk . 
made no sense . scared out of their minds and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips . nada . 
no fucking . 
three people : two guys a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room the same tent night after night . 
what i never could figure about the movie ? 
what movies ? 
if you 're looking at me look elsewhere . 
never would 've guessed . 
nice tent .

i think you closed the bar again . i 'll have to go out . 
no big deal . i 'm just trying to understand .

that 'd be up on your shoulder maybe your lower back . 
what 's that ? 
women miscarry all the-- 
and what 's your excuse for being here ? 
then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy .

bye dad .   see you in the morning okay ?

you mean like a trip ? 
do what you want it 's a free country . 
what do you want from me ? 
i do n't want alright ?   it 's not funny . i 'm really pissed off george .   you blew it now leave me alone . 
george you just ca n't show up tell me you love me and have everything be okay . 
well here i am .   see ? 
what are you doing here ? 
are we gon na split up ? 
what 's happening to us ? 
that 's correct -- but andrew never told me he had a heart condition .   he said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious . 
no .   i have n't done it in years . 
i have . 
do n't listen to him .   ca n't you see he 's trying to turn you against me . 
no -- he 's lying . 
shoot him . 
do n't push me frank .   i might lose my temper and send it out just for spite . 
so sue me .   things have changed .   i think you should go home -- and after you leave i see no reason for us to ever have contact again . 
i 've been thinking about that .   i 've decided to give it to you after i 've collected the inheritance .   you can take that one if you want -- but there 's another copy . 
that 's crazy . 
frank -- it 's rebecca .   i need to see you right away .   i 've got the tape . 
no -- i 'm a survivor . 
you can think whatever you want frank -- but i did n't kill andrew and i 'm not going to prison for something i did n't do . 
no -- you 're not . 
i do need you .   no matter what you think of me -- i did n't do it . 
i knew you were thinking that .   i could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom .   you 're wrong frank . i need you to believe that . 
you 're too weak frank .   when you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it .   if something gets in your way you remove it . 
fuck him !   he tried to shatter mine . 
to celebrate how masterfully you destroyed roston today . 
are you scared ? 
tonight we open new doors . 
sugar or honey ? 
do n't worry about paley .   he ca n't touch me .   no one can .   i 've thought it all out . 
i 'm sure you 'll be able to handle him . 
something wrong ? 
you can see me now . 
you were brilliant today . 
of course . 
i went out on the boat . 
i do n't know frank -- but do n't you think that 's something we should find out ? 
i do n't use cocaine anymore .   if she says she saw me doing it she 's lying . 
it is n't true .   you have to believe me . 
she 's mistaken . 
there 's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me frank . 
no -- that 's what i know you were thinking . 
you and me -- making love . 
yes -- it would be nice . 
it 's hard to let go of a dream is n't it ?   to let go of what you want ? 
that seems so far away from who you are now .   what happened ? 
did you always want to be a lawyer ? 
it wo n't be that hard . 
i hardly know him .   he wanted me and he could n't have me . 
andrew loved this old cabin .   he always dreamed about moving to tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach - bum .   i could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful .   soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it 's problems behind .   i wish he 'd had a chance to do it . 
no -- not at the office .   i 've got a better idea . 
yes -- she did . 
hi frank . 
not true .   shall i tell you what you were thinking ?   you were wondering if i was wearing anything under my skirt . 
tastes can change . 
that 's not an answer . 
i 'm the photographer . 
what do you think ? 
is it against the law ? 
why not ? 
i know . 
can we get out of here ? 
we started talking .   in fact we talked until four in the morning .   we discovered we shared a lot of the same interests .   after that we were together all the time until he left . he used to call me every night after he came back .   then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him . i 've never left . 
i was at a cocktail party .   very trendy .   andrew was in chicago on business .   he had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling .   he looked so helpless . 
because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it . 
when i was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard . so did this family down the road .   i used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries .   it was n't easy . the stone walls were high and i 'd scrape my knees as i climbed over . on the other side were wild rose bushes .   the thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as i lowered myself down . 
because -- it 's beyond intellect . it 's emotion .   it 's passion .   it has to be experienced -- it ca n't be imagined . 
i do n't know if it 's something i can explain to you . 
i thought the subject was sex ? 
something like that . 
have you ever seen animals make love mr. dulaney ?   they have such passion -- such savage emotion .   they struggle and snarl and claw but neither hurts the other .   not really . 
i am who i am .   i ca n't deny it anymore than you can deny who you are .   i like sex different -- i like it wild .   that 's not a crime .   i loved andrew .   we made love together .   we made it differently but we still made love .   it was our way .   it was private -- and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice .   if i was some middle - aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me ? 
i 'm used to being on the outside looking in .   the same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together . 
andrew hardly needed leading .   he was a very passionate man .   he was eager to explore .   i gave him what he wanted .   we fulfilled each others needs . 
he 'll file .   he 's an ambitious man . ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others . 
and that 's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me .   that 's why i need a very good lawyer mr. dulaney . 
you must have some feeling .   some immediate impression .   a young attractive woman involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will .   and the things that went on in that house .   such wild sex .   what kind of picture does that paint ? 
do you think i did it ? 
are you going to represent me ? 
it did n't get there from me . 
no -- never . 
six thirty -- and he was very much alive . 
i did n't know that andrew was dead until mr. sattler called me at home that night . 
horrible .   he was tired and pale . 
i opened the bathroom door one day and saw miss lawson pouring cocaine out of a vial . 
no -- never . 
six years . 
no -- but i can get it for you . 
rebecca lawson . 
i assume his girlfriend . 
i had some papers to pick up . 
a little after eleven . 
because he called me . 
to show you this .   it 's a letter from that lawyer koehler .   he wrote it to me the day after i saw him .   he 's the one who told me i could get the money if miss lawson went to jail . 
i 'm gon na go to jail .   i know they 're gon na make it look like i did it . they got ta put it on someone . 
what do you think i 've got ?   a gun ? maybe i 'm gon na kill you too .   maybe i 'll blow your head off right now . 
you take what people say and make it ugly .   you make others believe what you want them to .   she should have been found guilty .   she should n't have gotten off . 
no !   why would i want to kill him ? 
i do n't know . 
three fifteen . 
dristan nasal spray . 
she talked him into it .   she wanted everything . 
i 've been to a few -- yes . 
i 've tried it . 
i 'm a practical woman mr. dulaney . killing andrew was n't in my best interest .   as it is i 'm out of a job and i 'm not in his will . 
i was jealous .   of course i was hurt . he switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with .   but i did n't kill him . 
yes i slept with him but that was a long time ago . 
that bastard ! 
who told you that ? 
yes .   i suppose it 's possible . 
i do n't know .   i 'm not sure . 
i suppose . 
yes -- he mentioned it . 
he said that if it kept up she was going to kill him .   that his heart could n't take it . 
yes--   it was on a friday .   i remember because i was going to visit my sister for her birthday .   it would be october twenty - eighth . 
what other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial ? 
i was at the house one morning -- i thought miss lawson was upstairs with mr. marsh .   when i went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial . 
yes -- cocaine . 
i was n't lookin ' through the keyhole if that 's what you 're thinking .   i 'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to andrew .   i 'd find their little toys all over the place . 
andrew was a kind and gentle man but he was thirty years older than her . where 's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had . 
i really do n't know her that well . we would say hello to each other when i would come to the house but that was about it . 
i do n't know .   it 's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be rebecca . 
he did .   look i know you can lead a horse to water but you ca n't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough   -- and well ... 
i worked for mr. marsh for six years . he was a good man -- until she came along . 
frank -- stop it !   stop it ! 
i do n't want our lives ruined because of this .   i love you frank .   i want this to work -- but you have to help me .   you have to come back from where ever it is you are . 
it was a place to start . 
you used to like to touch me -- to make love to me . 
why did n't you come to me ? 
we ca n't pretend this is n't happening . 
talk to me . 
maybe it would be a good idea if you just took michael . 
it 's bad enough that you are .   it 's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me . 
you 're sleeping with her are n't you ? 
this is n't a courtroom .   do n't try to turn this around on me . 
why did you lie to me ? 
charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you .   you were with her were n't you ? 
where have you been ? 
that 's what i was hoping you 'd tell me . 
we have to talk . 
is that alright frank ? 
no one 's asking you not to work .   i just think you could make some time for your son . 
why do n't you talk to him now ? 
frank -- i know you 're busy but michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him .   he wanted to know why you were n't talking to him . 
she sounds like quite a woman . 
what 's she like ? 
if he files are you going to take the case ? 
how can cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults ? 
i swear -- the both of you .   some example you set . 
he could let you have your vacation . 
we 're supposed to go to the lake . 
no -- it has to be done by tomorrow . 
if you want me to . 
this is not relaxing . 
you 're on vacation remember ?   you 're supposed to be relaxing . 
let me go !   godammit frank let go ! 
do n't use language like that at the dinner table . 
not even if they 're a dork .   you should go by and see how he 's feeling . 
michael you should n't be happy when someone else is n't feeling well . 
that 's too bad . 
well i can help . 
i do n't mind waiting . 
it 's a beautiful picture of her . 
maybe it 's an italian thing . their mother was italian . 
not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business -- 
my jewish friend 's grandmother did . 
i simply can not stand that tone ! 
you said it in that tone ! like you were angry at me my brother at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch ! 
well that 's a long time . 
boy . it sure has been a long time . 
michael does n't understand . people who make the kind of money my brother makes do n't carry money on them . they keep it all in various accounts . 
no we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife . she told me all the dirt . i forgot how interesting things can get around here . it was so good to see them . the last time we visited they were in europe . he is doing so well . he ordered champagne . for lunch ! i nearly died . 
carolyn -- you want these candlesticks ? 
i do not need instructions from you to bathe !   i knew you 'd do this ! i knew i 'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual ! i came to be here for you ! i did n't have to come !   lord knows i was never much welcome in this house before . apparently dead or alive nothing 's changed . 
no treasure maps huh ? 
how bizarre ! 
i am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what i 've done ! 
no . you can have them . 
aw betty . 
oh just a old letter from a friend . 
mr. peterson are you sure mama wrote all this ? 
i know . i do n't understand it either . 
i 'm sure you have n't done anything . have some iced tea . how are the kids ? 
you 're right -- that is sick . 
-- for over twenty years because that 's what i was taught -- you stick with it ! normal people do n't get divorced . i ca n't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to europe for christ 's sake -- quite frankly i do n't think he ever did ! and now i find out in between bake sales my mother was anais nin ! 
what gets me is i 'm 46 years old . i 've been in this crummy fucking marriage - 
did we want to ? 
was this during betty ? 
i never knew that . 
you never dated kathy reynolds ! 
i think i better . between the book and the coffee i 'm this close to raping the busboy . 
boy . all these years i 've resented not living the wild life in some place like paris and all the time i could 've moved back to iowa ... are you drunk ? 
you mean -- she did n't like sex ? 
yeah . but i thought she died . 
have you called betty ?   maybe you should . 
and do what ? live alone ? go back to school ? find someone else ? start a magazine for confused woman ? ... what if i ca n't do any of those things ? 
oh do n't feel sorry for me . please . no one 's forcing me to stay . 
i do n't think so . not yet anyway . and besides something like that does n't make you a bad person . he reminds me of steve in a way . steve 's weak immoral and a liar but he 's still a real nice guy . he just should n't be married .   at least not to me . you getting hungry ? i 'm hungry . 
oh he did not . he 's such a nice guy . 
stop it !   i want to read them ! if you do n't want to then just leave . but do n't you push me around like i 'm some mule you paid for -- i already got a husband ! 
well i 'd like to read them . 
what are you doing ? 
no i do n't think so . i -- 
i ca n't believe she never told me ? we spoke at least once a week . how could she do that ? 
do n't say that ! 
my lord . it must feel real nice living inside your head with peter pan and the easter bunny . 
i do n't know . i 'm completely in the dark here . that 's what i get for moving away . 
' 82 . 
that he be cremated and his ashes thrown on roseman bridge . 
that would be some trick . he 's already dead . that 's what this other letter is .   from his attorney . he left most of his things to mama and requested ... 
well he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him she could find him through the national geographic magazine . he as a photographer . he promises not to write again . then all it says is ...   i love you ... robert . 
come here a minute . 
i remember a mrs. delaney but mama told me years ago she died . 
well there 's a problem . 
he 's not coming . 
i have some sandwich fixings if you 're hungry . 
mom 's orders . 
no leave it . i 'll do it later . listen maybe you and floyd can come for dinner on saturday . i 'm sure richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all . 
no no . i just did n't sleep well . i 'm not used to sleeping alone . and this heat . would you mind ? 
i do n't know . i woke up a little dizzy . i did n't sleep well . i think i need to lay down . 
madge . please . something 's happened . i 've met someone . i 've fallen in love in a way i 've never thought could happen my entire life . it 's our last day together . i feel like i 'm going to die when he leaves . please . help me . 
robert if that happens you 'll have to decide . i wo n't be able to . 
no . do n't do this . 
i do n't know . please ... 
i want to keep it forever . i want to love you the way i do now the rest of my life . do n't you understand -- we 'll lose it if we leave . i ca n't make an entire life disappear to start a new one . all i can do is try to hold onto to both . help me . help me not lose loving you . 
robert . please .   you do n't understand -- no one does . when a woman makes the choice to marry to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops . you build a life of details . you become a mother a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move . and when they leave they take your life of details with them . and then you 're expected move again only you do n't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long . not even yourself . you never in your life think that love like this can happen to you . 
we are the choices we 've made robert . 
no matter how much distance we put between us and this house i bring with it with me . and i 'll feel it every minute we 're together . and i 'll blame loving you for how much it hurts . and then even these four days wo n't be anything more than something sordid and ... a mistake . 
you 've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here . it 'll all change . 
no they do n't say much . but carolyn 's 16 . she 's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she 's going to fall in love she 's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone . if i leave what does that say to her ? 
his family 's lived for almost a hundred years . richard does n't know how to live anywhere else . and the kids ... 
for anyone . they 'll never be able to live through the talk . richard will never be able to . he does n't deserve that . he has n't hurt anyone in his life . 
no matter how i keep turning it around in my mind -- it does n't seem like the right thing . 
what makes it different robert ? 
what does that have to do with it ? 
you wo n't be made to feel ! period . you 've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you 've touched our lives ! well go to hell ! it is n't human not to feel lonely -- it is n't human not to afraid ! you 're a hypocrite and you 're a phony ! 
no one 's asking you to ! 
fine . more eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time ? 
i do n't want you to say anything . i do n't need you to say anything . 
you have no idea what you 've done to me do you ? and after you leave i 'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here . if anything happened at all ! and i 'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some ... housewife 's kitchen in romania if you 'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group . 
gee i do n't know . i guess i 'm not cut out to be a world citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time . 
yes . absolutely . you have this habit of not needing and that it 's hard to break . i understand .   of course in that case why sleep -- you do n't need rest or for that matter eat you do n't need food . 
to do what ? be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular ? i mean what would be the point . would you pass the butter ? 
well what is this ? 
well i just want to know the procedure . i do n't want to upset your routine . do you want any jam ? 
well these ... women friends of yours ... all over the world . how does it work ? do you see some of them again ? do you forget others ? do you write them now and then ? how do you manage it ? 
good . more coffee ?   robert i hope you do n't mind my asking but i feel like i should . 
sleep all right ? 
long day . go to sleep . 
where was she ? 
you 're right you know . we do n't have much time . 
just that it 's been a perfect day and that i 'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this . 
what were your parents like ? 
i just wondered . why were you trouble ? 
what were you like when you were younger ? 
but you do n't mind . 
why do you say that ? 
i bet you could do a book . 
on that one is beautiful . look at their expressions . as if the camera were n't on them at all . as if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling . 
i sat there once . it was hot . like today . i 'd been shopping . i had all these bags around my feet i kept having to move every time the waiter came by ... 
where ? near the doorway or the near the front of the church ? 
and arraccinos and zeppolis . yes ! i know it ! 
why ! ? because i 'm having thoughts i hardly know what to do with . i ... ca n't seem to ... stop them . 
i just feel like i 'm getting a little ... out of control that 's all . it 's kind of frightening . 
oh i 'm sorry . 
yes . tell me about the day you got off the train . 
right now . tell me someplace you 've been -- someplace on the other side of the world . anywhere but here . 
take me somewhere . 
are you hungry ? 
no . i ca n't . not yet . 
yes that 'd be nice . 
actually no . i 've got everything under control . i 'd like to clean up myself a bit . i 'm going to take a bath . dinner'll be ready in about a half hour . 
fine . they 're all having a good time . how many more shots do you have ? 
sorry i 'm late . richard called . 
i want you to come . 
i understand .   that 's very kind of you . 
i think he 's running for town crier next year . 
oh . i guess you got the whole story . 
oh hi . look i 'm running a little late but i 'll still ... 
yeah . see you later . 
no . i 'll drive myself . i have a few errands . i 'll meet you there . 
oh sure . great . 
wonderful . uh ... 
the light was fading . huh - huh . 
no . i was just ... no . 
yes ! hi . 
... i feel like something 's been spoiled now . 
listen i 'm sorry i -- 
i thought we were just having a conversation . you seem to be reading all this meaning into it . meanings i must be too simple to uh ... interpret or something . 
what made you ask such a question ? 
just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family does n't necessarily mean they 're hypnotized . just because i 've never seen a gazelle stampede does n't mean i 'm asleep in the world . 
no i 'm just saying -- 
but it 's not the same . 
but no one in particular . 
but -- how can you just live for what you want ? what about other people ? 
do you ever regret not having a family ? 
do you ever regret it ? the divorce i mean . 
why does n't it scare you ? 
you really do n't need anyone ? 
woman friends too ? 
you must get lonely at times . 
so what happened ? 
do you mind if i ... ask you why you got divorced ? 
no . i 'll do them later . 
umm i do n't know . i can look it up . 
no . i 'm all right . it 's working . 
smells like dirt . 
you drink bug repellent ? 
well it 's kind of buggy out there . 
my god . how i 'd love to see that . 
no . it 's all right . i just meant it might be a little dull for you telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere . 
i do n't know . i 've never thought about it ... what was the most exciting place you 've ever been to ? unless you 're tired of talking about it . 
my children . and richard did n't like my working . 
i 'd like to think so . i know one of them went on to medical school . 
i did n't mean that the way it sounded . 
i do n't think you 're normal . 
you sound like an artist . 
why do you think ? 
you ought to write these stories down . 
oh you ! 
then what happened ? 
oh my god ...   you 're blushing . 
help cook ? 
would you like to stay for dinner ?   there are n't many choices in town and ... anyway you 'd have to eat alone . so would i. 
but i ... we do n't even know each other . 
i feel so embarrassed . 
i think so . 
yes . very clean . 
no . i mean yes he 's clean but he 's also other things . he 's a very hard worker . very honest . very caring . gentle . good father . 
he 's very ... clean . 
richard was in the army . i met him while i was living in naples . i did n't know where iowa was . i only cared that it was america . and of course being with richard . 
i guess . except i 'm one of the people it frightens . 
oh . michael 's 17 and carolyn 's 16 . 
about a year and a half . 
my husband took the kids to the illinos state fair . my daughter 's entering a prize steer . 
and how long are you here for ? 
where are you staying while you 're here ? 
i 'm so sorry about that . it was rude . i think i just got nervous for some reason . 
not at all . 
oh that 's nice . 
looking for something in particular ? there 's not much of a selection . 
no i 'm not .   i do n't know why i said that . i 've been in a very ... strange mood all day . i 've never done anything like that before . it 's ... i 'm just ...   well you know the whole world is just going nuts . 
no not at all --   except those are poisonous . 
oh there you are . 
this time of year . 
i do n't mind waiting . 
long .   you just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there ? 
you just ... got off the train because it looked pretty ? 
no really ? 
small town on the eastern side no one 's ever heard of called bari . 
no i do n't mind . i 'm not from here . i was born in italy . 
uh ... uh ...   umm ... long time . 
oh . when did you move back ? 
are you from washington originally ? 
maybe it 's because i live here . 
hmm - mmm . 
no . i was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom but that can wait .   i just have to get my shoes . 
well you 're pretty close . it 's only about two miles from here . 
roseman bridge ? 
are you supposed to be in iowa ? 
i 'm very sad but richard said that since it 's cary grant he completely understands . i 'm also taking mrs. delaney away from this town . she 'll be living with cary and i in beverly hills . 
i said to him cary you 're being ridiculous . you 're more than half her age . he said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me . 
yes . and i 've accepted . 
want anything special for dinner ? 
it 's only four days . 
i 'm positive . 
i 'm not sick richard . i 'm just not tired now go back to sleep before you 're up for the whole night too ! 
i ca n't sleep . 
i 'm not tired . i thought i might finish carolyn 's skirt . 
later . go back to sleep . 
well you should all go to bed early . i 'll do the cleaning up . 
i do n't know . can we turn it off ? i have such a headache . 
it 's a chicago station . i found it the other day . 
yes . i 'm fine . it 's just this heat i think . 
is n't that nice ? you should bring her home to meet us ! 
well what 's nice about her ? tell us ! 
what 's she like ? 
what 's her name ? 
are you seeing betty tonight ? 
yes they are . 
about an hour ago . 
think for a second . is there someplace she said she wanted to go ? 
what happened ? 
i do n't . 
your father was his best friend .   he loved jeremiah .   so he must hate him the most of all now .   he 'll take his time . but even if it is too late .   if your father is dead .   it 's not over .   the door has to be closed . 
it 's the only way .   it 's possible your father may not be dead yet . 
i know damn well she 's there . 
outta my way boy .   cinnabar ?   i 'm coming ! 
some holes ca n't be filled .   some hungers ca n't be satisfied . 
do n't feed that dog . 
where are we baby ? 
jimmy you 've got -- 
no ?   that mean there 's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit ? what are you going to do now ?   kill us ? kill us all ? 
i do n't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese or rip you open and eat you right here . 
no baby .   i 'm serious .   cancel that meeting .   i got more fruit that needs checking .   come home with me now . 
left hand 's the past .   your right 's the present .   and the future .   but it 's not written in stone .   it 's written in flesh and blood .   and flesh and blood will change .   see ?   there 's something here a new line right across your life line . 
my mama 's bag and my granma 's bag and a long line of mamas before her . 
let me see your hand . 
maybe i oughtta get there a little early . for good luck . 
my god .   my dress .   we have to find it . and burn it .   and shut the door . 
told you so .   alright .   we tried .   let 's go home . 
girl they build gates like that to keep people like us out . 
we 'll have to sneak in . 
fine .   maybe i got nothing to lose . ' cept you . 
like what ?   i got a little power sure . a touch of the shining a little of the sight .   but no more than you do .   we 're not witches .   i ca n't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away . besides maybe they deserve it .   maybe we all do . 
eddie mack that cop .   and jeremiah .   and even when he 's done who knows .   he wo n't be satisfied .   just like that demon dog . feed it and it just grows hungrier . feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more .   who knows where it 'll stop . that kind of hunger ai n't never satisfied . 
he 'll kill them .   he 'll kill every last one of them . 
sure if it was really him .   but it is n't that simple .   jimmy 's body died a long time ago .   and his soul is long gone and all that 's left is that ravening hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself i suppose . 
you got his hands .   beautiful hands .   i did n't even know .   that night .   when they - we - killed him that you were already alive inside me .   life 's like that . grows right out of death . 
your father .   he was your father . 
if he was trying to kill you you 'd be dead . 
it 's alright baby . 
please .   it 's for your own good . 
i lied . 
... i 've seen things .   in there .   last night .   you did too .   do n't tell me you did n't .   you were crying like a baby . 
just a bad place .   and the doorway to worse . 
maybe once upon a time .   but that was long ago .   back before ... before it became what it is . 
nothing but a wide world o ' pain locked in there . 
i do n't want you meeting around that house .   you stay away from those kids . and away from that dog . 
you got a vision girl .   just like i got . just like my momma had .   and the good lord did n't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures .   that 's just wasted time . 
are n't you going to join us ? 
should i ? 
that building ? 
no thanks . 
i 'm not joking boy .   do n't feed it . it 'll only make it hungrier . 
then your father 's a dead man and jimmy bones is gon na be around a long time . 
the blood is still there .   we just got ta figure out where . 
... see there ai n't just two parts to a person .   there 's three .   body - soul and spirit .   the spirit lives in the blood . it 's the wanting that holds body and soul together and sometimes the wanting lives on .   jimmy 's blood must still be in the house . 
you sure we oughta save him ?   why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling ? 
you 're pretty black to be growing up in rossmore park . 
you look mighty familiar to me .   you sure you 're not from around here ? 
caesar you do n't know shit . 
caesar do n't . 
i knew i could n't trust you . 
i should have let him kill you . 
tell them i 'm at st. mary 's off the kennedy in the waiting room but stay on the phone until i come out . 
i want what 's mine half the money . we get rid of mickey no one else dies .   no one .   say yes i understand . 
we make a deal or i come out and hand this phone to mickey . 
now you listen to me asshole i know your gun is behind the bar ... 
but everybody is all right . 
we were in a car accident -- 
good boy . 
you 're blowing your only chance . act like i 'm gino . 
bullshit you killed him .   not me . you did it because you could n't stand the thought of johnnie fucking you . 
you murdered gino ! 
saved me ?   you do n't even know me . you used me caesar just like i used you .   all part of the business . 
ha !   what a load of crap .   look at yourself caesar .   you 're a thug . |you launder money for the mob .   you rent women like you rented this apartment . 
everything you could n't . 
let us go and we 'll make a deal . 
you need the money just like we do . 
caesar stop acting like an asshole and think -- 
not until he has the money ! 
he ca n't kill you -- 
do n't tell him -- 
just hurry . 
who are you going to call ? 
what are you doing ? 
i do n't know .   it could be anywhere . we do n't even know if he was alone . please caesar we do n't have much time .   let 's get out of here . 
it 's not here caesar . 
caesar someone could see us out here . 
caesar what are we going to do ? 
what happened to them ? 
caesar you just killed gino marzzone . 
caesar what are you going to do ? 
for christ 's sake johnnie do what he says . 
you do n't you ca n't believe that ... 
caesar this is crazy . 
bullshit !   you do n't need me !   you 've never needed me !   i ca n't help you ! understand ? !   i have to get out . 
the hell i ca n't ! 
this is insane ! 
but it could be anywhere . 
the money ?   the money 's gone . 
all right caesar . 
i mean it caesar forget johnnie forget the money let 's just go now before it 's too late -- 
caesar maybe we should run -- 
caesar what are we going to do ? 
but you know he did it . 
why ?   why would johnnie do this ? 
caesar i know johnnie .   it was him . i screamed when i saw him .   i could n't believe i missed them .   i knew you were going to be upset so i thought i 'd apologize and give gino the scotch .   i honked a couple of times but he did n't stop . 
it was him .   i 'm positive . 
i was getting out of the car when i saw him in the mercedes . 
because i just saw johnnie downstairs . 
that does n't make any sense . 
you mean they were n't up here ? 
they just left did n't they ? 
they were early . 
do n't be silly caesar .   it 'll take five minutes . 
do n't worry i 'll get some more . 
i 'm sorry .   it was an accident . 
ummm ...   in the linen closet . 
what are you going to do with it ? 
caesar what happened ? 
caesar i 'm serious .   this is too much .   i have to get out of here . 
caesar i 'm leaving . 
that 's none of your goddamn business caesar . 
jesus caesar ! 
she 's doing the work herself . 
caesar this is corky .   corky caesar . 
i did n't expect -- 
all part of the business . 
we make our own choices we pay our own prices . 
...   thank you . 
i 'm sorry it 's just you hear stories . 
all right . 
how do i know you are cops ? 
gunfire ?   is this a joke ? 
i 'm here are n't i ? 
i 'm sorry corky ... 
i was so afraid you ... 
oh thank god . 
okay all right . 
oh christ i got to get out of here ! 
what if he does n't run ? 
believes it !   jesus it 's driving him crazy .   he wants to kill him .   i do n't know corky i do n't know what he is going to do .   i 'm getting nervous really nervous . 
he totally freaked .   i 've never seen him like this .   he 's out of his fucking mind . 
it 's me . 
i wo n't . 
if you 're this goddamn smart how did you ever get caught ? 
jesus that 's beautiful . 
if he runs everyone will assume he took the money . 
c !   shit i 'm sorry ! 
i still do n't see how i 'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment .   everyone will think i did it . 
when i get the scotch how do i know you wo n't take off ? 
i 'm just asking what if ? 
you ca n't know for certain that he wo n't see you . 
what if he sees you ? 
shit !   oh shit ! 
where will you be ? 
poor boy has to work so hard . 
gino travels with a big man named roy .   caesar calls him the driver . 
the plane is in at seven so i 'd say about eight . 
scotch glenlivet .   i remember that caesar made a huge deal about it . 
gino does n't know english or at least he pretends he does n't so he does n't talk much .   he gets right to the point .   both times they talked for about five minutes had one drink and then they left . 
he does it right in front of him . 
johnnie hits on anything in high heels . 
not much really .   caesar was nervous kept cleaning the apartment .   |the first time he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear . 
yeah twice . 
that 's his brother . 
gino marzzone . 
it started way before i was around . i think basically it 's because he thinks johnnie is a complete idiot . but johnnie runs chicago because gino is his father . 
like each other ?   they hate each other . 
it 's in a case on his desk . 
in his office .   i saw it this morning . 
to let it dry . 
he hung it up . 
do you think you know me like that ? 
is that what you think ? 
you think i 'm lying ? 
that 's why i need your help .   you said you were good . 
caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |shelly 's books to figure out how he did it . 
shelly said it was over two million dollars . 
caesar is going to get the money and bring -- 
if those quarters fell to the floor would you still reach up to that cash register ? 
you made a choice once .   do you think you would make that same choice again ? 
i want out .   i want a new life .   i see what i 've been waiting for but i need you corky . 
he 's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be . |but mickey does n't like it like they do .   i suppose that 's why he 's good at it . 
caesar lives for these moments .   he tells me it 's just the business but i know it 's more than that .   he likes it .   the violence .   i 'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars .   he says they remind him who he his .   they 're all like that . except maybe mickey . 
maybe he did .   he would brag to me all the time .   he was never afraid of caesar because he did n't know him .   not like i do . 
for shelly taking the money was a way to take from caesar .   he could have run at any time but he did n't because he did n't want out . 
that 's what he told himself .   but it was n't even about me it was about caesar .   he wanted what caesar had . that 's how they are .   i understand them . 
shelly was skimming from the business . he came to see me yesterday because he was afraid caesar figured it out . he wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him . 
fuck it !   i think you better leave . 
no .   shelly knows what i am .   he saw me in a bar with another woman . 
you mean shelly ? 
we make our own choices and we pay our own prices .   i think we 're more alike than you want to admit . 
all my life everyone has been telling me that when i have sex i 'm not really having sex .   not real sex . but they 're wrong .   i know what is and is n't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex . 
what you heard was n't sex . 
i do n't . 
i know what i am .   i do n't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder . 
oh no she 's nothing like you .   she 's a lot smarter than you . 
because it 's the truth . 
we 're not that different corky . 
i do n't understand - ? 
what are you afraid of ? 
you did n't want to see me did you ? 
yes there is .   i felt it this morning when i brought you the coffee . 
what 's wrong ? 
i 'm glad you did . 
you did n't have to tell me if you did n't want to . 
i 'm already in your bed . 
the redistribution of wealth ? 
yes it is . 
almost five years . 
they took over a club i was working at .   caesar started managing it . 
you have to ask ? 
...   i needed that . 
i wanted to apologize . 
i had to see you . 
...   yes . 
if i say yes will you take your hand away ? 
because i want to .   i 've wanted to since i first saw you in the elevator . 
is n't it obvious ?   i 'm trying to seduce you . 
i have a tattoo would you like to see it ? 
are you surprised that i know what it is ? 
curious ?   that 's funny i 'm feeling a bit curious myself right now . 
you seem uncomfortable .   do i make you nervous corky ? 
a beer .   of course . 
what do you want ? 
thank you so much .   you have to let me pay you something -- 
i 'm sorry look forget it .   i should n't have called ... 
yeah come on in . 
i 'm sorry i usually would call rajeev but i did n't know what to do so i called mr. bianchinni . 
oh no .   shit .   i did n't know he would call you .   god you must think |i'm a total nuisance . 
my pleasure . 
i should be going .   you can drop the cup off anytime . 
oh no no .   i 'm not the marrying kind . 
no but caesar does .   he likes him . says he 's a good italian . 
oh really . 
so how do you know the owner mr. bianchinni ? 
i knew it . 
truck .   of course . 
that is so amazing .   i 'm in awe of people who can fix things .   my dad was like that .   we never had anything new .   whenever something broke he would open it up tinker with it and it would work .   his hands were magic . 
you 're doing everything yourself ? 
yes it really causes problems . sometimes it 's like you 're in the same room .   but if it 's too much trouble i understand ... 
no it is n't your fault .   the walls here are just so thin . 
yeah see i 'm kind of a night person so i was wondering if it was n't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools . 
my pleasure ...   but to be honest i did have a slightly ulterior motive here .   i was wondering if i could ask a small favor ? 
i guessed you were straight black . 
so this is temporary for you ? 
rajeev the man who usually works on the building . 
i heard you working in here and i just wondered if you 'd like a cup of coffee ? 
hi .   my name is violet .   we sort of met in the elevator -- 
thanks mickey but i need to get out you know ?   get away from all of this . 
i know you will . 
i will never understand it mickey . you did n't even call the police . 
mickey !   oh god mickey ! 
oh my god .   was anyone hurt ? 
mickey ?   what are you doing here ? 
oh god . 
caesar wants me to stay . 
i could be lying . 
you ca n't kill me yet . 
either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face . 
lick me . 
my brushes i have to clean my brushes .   thanks though . 
i should be going . 
no .   rajeev 's in india . 
you planned this whole thing did n't you ? 
...   me neither . 
you know what the difference is between us violet ? 
how 'd it go ? 
do n't be sorry .   help me . 
you do n't quit on me violet and i wo n't quit on you . 
i 'm still here . 
we 're almost there violet .   just hang on . 
listen if he does n't run all you have to do is break down go to your bedroom and pack some things start crying saying you love him but you ca n't do it .   you 're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out . 
that means he probably will kill johnnie . 
it 's all right violet .   it 's working . all we got to do is wait him out and see what he does . 
that 's okay as long as he believes it was johnnie . 
what happened ? 
i think we 're going to find out . 
i had a partner and she fucked me . 
every job like this has moments where things do n't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass . it 's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart . 
thank you . 
you 'll be clean and we 'll be rich . 
he 'll have to run . 
if it 's real enough he 'll believe it because deep down he 'll want to . 
because of what you are going to tell him .   you have to make it as real as you can .   the moment you open the door with the scotch in your hand you will be covered and that moment is the most important moment in the plan . 
not caesar . 
the same way i 'll know that you went to scotch .   trust . 
there is no going back . 
if he does ... 
trust me violet . 
he wo n't . 
an accident . 
and as you do the bottle will slip from your hands .   -- and shatter against the hardwood floor . 
waiting in the apartment next door . 
we want him to come down to relax feel in control again . 
any bodyguards ? 
what time did you say they would be there ? 
what did gino drink ? 
it 's getting better and better . keep going . 
has caesar ever seen him ? 
does johnnie hit on you ? 
what happened ? 
gino marzzone is coming to your apartment .   it 's a big deal is n't it ?   that means caesar will be ready . he does n't want to look like an idiot . gino has been there before ? 
sweet jesus . 
and johnnie is his son that 's johnnie marzzone ? 
gino marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money ? 
...   shit . 
marzzone ?   as in angelo marzzone head of the marzzone family ? 
who is gino ? 
it sounded like he and caesar do n't like each other . 
all right now tell me about johnnie . 
does the case lock ? 
and where is it now ? 
then what ?   exactly . 
you said he washed the money ? 
i think ... 
the difference is i can have sex with someone i just met someone i hardly know but to steal i need to know someone like i know myself . 
i 'm just making a point .   you have no idea what you 're asking .   how much trust two people need to do something like this . 
all you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected someone like me . 
i did n't say that but since you did let 's say that you are .   it would have been easy to set shelly up .   you could have got him killed knowing that caesar would bring the money to the apartment . 
all right let 's say for the moment that i believe everything you are saying . 
i am but ... 
these people are serious violet . if you want to know how serious ask shelly .   they 're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules .   you fuck them you 've got to do it right . 
wait a minute .   wait a minute .   do you have any idea what you are saying ? you are asking me to help you fuck the mob . 
how much money ? 
what choice ? 
for what ? 
sounds like he wanted to get caught . 
he was in love with you right ? 
even though he knew about you ? 
i think so too . 
i suppose he just wants to watch . 
do n't tell me you 're a workaholic . 
what about that guy this morning ? 
what was it then ? 
what the fuck was it ? 
for christ 's sake violet !   i heard you !   thin walls remember ? 
what are you saying ?   that you do n't have sex with men ? 
is that what her daddy tells her ? 
let me guess .   this is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside .   that inside you there is a little dyke just like me ? 
how can you sit in that bed and say that ? 
i know !   you ca n't understand because we 're different violet .   we 're different . 
i 'm not afraid of anything . 
if there is one thing i ca n't stand about sleeping with women it 's all the fucking mind reading . 
shit here we go . 
so am i. 
i guess i wanted to . 
my cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught .   she was always more honest than me . 
that 's what i tell someone when i 'm trying to get them in my bed . 
is n't that what you wanted to know ? what i did time for ? 
the redistribution of wealth . 
five years is a long time . 
how long have you been with him ? 
he 's a launderer ? 
how did you meet him ? 
caesar 's mafia is n't he ? 
tell me about it . 
do n't apologize please .   i ca n't stand women who apologize for wanting sex . 
look i do n't think this is a good idea . 
you dropped that earring down the drain on purpose did n't you ? 
curious maybe . 
a beer ? 
okay one drink . 
no .   mr. bianchinni asked me to do it .   i did it . 
do you have a pot or a bucket ? 
i told bianchinni i would take a look .   is it that sink ? 
he said you lost something . 
not exactly . 
caesar is your husband ? 
do you know him ? 
i do n't really .   i was referred to him . 
' 63 chevy . 
no no trouble .   there 's other work to do . 
are they really ? 
oh i 'm sorry -- 
a favor ? 
mmmm ...   thanks i needed this . 
good guess . 
pretty much .   one day at a time . 
oh he went home to india but as far as i know he 'll be back . 
yeah sure .   i 'm corky . 
you have id ? 
can i help you ? 
what about you ? 
what was i thinking right ? 
and that 's it ? 
who is it ? 
yes .   that 's who i want to be . 
it does n't matter who you were before .   it 's who you want to be . that 's all that matters .   we have this money .   we have what we have .   i had nothing before and now i do n't know maybe i have more maybe it 's nothing but ...   i say we leave here .   we leave this place .   we go until we ca n't go anymore . 
< u > so what are we doing</u > ? 
what does that mean ?   jason what does that mean ?   jason please ... who is he ?

we 're about an hour away . 
i needed a break . 
you 're paranoid .   you were shot . it 's natural . 
people do amazing things when they 're scared . 
lots of people have guns .   you 're american .   americans love guns . 
okay so you 're a victim . 
sounds like you were in an accident or something . 
what are you talking about ? 
-- you could put it together -- 
well this is great .   i 'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are . 
when you think of it before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship what do you see ? 
and you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that ? 
amnesia ?   you 're saying you do n't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago ? 
what ?   like amnesia ?

why do n't you say no system is perfect . 
they could n't be worse for the buttles . 
we 've got both . 
do n't you know the sort of thing that information retrieval does ? 
i mean it does n't suit you .

a heavy christmas present . 
what parcel ?

where are you taking me ? 
where are you taking me ?

i did n't run away . i left the flat . 
i know you . i saw you through the floor did n't i ? 
it 's my fucking life .

who are you ? 
how can i act naturally when you 've trying to break my arm ? 
who are you ? let go ! 
mrs buttle are you alright ? 
are you alright ? 
come on up . 
who is it ? 
this is not a good time . 
no we just ate . i only remember how tough my father was . now i know he had to be like that to make us tough . this city'll kill you if you are n't strong enough . 
i wish these people would leave already . i ca n't listen to another story . did you see him ?   that doctor says the brain is coming around . they 're waiting for the heart to stabilize . i do n't know who to believe . he says they still have to keep him tied up . 
ok last night i was weak . it wo n't happen again . and all that shit i said -- it was just because i was stoned . forget it . 
too bad . he called me up today can you believe that ? i do n't know how he got my number . he asks me do i want to come over and see him i tell him i 'd rather go to a leper colony . he says there 's a new gang that wants to kill him take over the business . i told him i hope he 's right . that they kill him . that 's what i told him . 
i heard cy coates was brought in . he looked pretty bad . 
or maybe you wanna fuck me ? everyone else has . 
what is it ? you want to help me you feel sorry for me ? keep it to yourself . 
you and cy have a nice talk ? he tell you about sunrise enterprises helping people ? well i 've seen him hurt people . why are you following me ? 
no no . 
do n't be a cop . if you have any doubts about this it 's my fault . 
i just have to relax a little . not feel so guilty all the time . 
promise you wo n't go inside . 
i should n't have asked you to come . 
no i 'll be fine . i 'm just visiting a sick friend . 
if i 'm not back in fifteen minutes hit the buzzer . that way she 'll let me go . 
i 'm only asking because it 's a dangerous building . there 's been some robberies a woman was raped not long ago . this woman i 'm seeing she 'll want to talk to me all day but if i can point to you out the window and say you 're waiting i can be out quick . if anything happens i 'll be in apartment 16m. 
do n't say that . i wanted to cut my father loose too . they told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he 's better and i go in . it 's killing me seeing him fighting like that .   look since you 're here maybe you could do me a favor . i need you to wait for me outside this building okay ? i have to visit a friend who 's sick . 
i 'm all right . i just ca n't stand to see people tied up .   i 'm in the waiting room for hours listening to noel screaming . the only reason he 's screaming is 'cause he 's tied up . 
i better go check on my father . thanks for the pizza . i owe you one . maybe when he gets better you know when we 're done with all this . 
maybe not . i was a different person then . does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this ? 
you must get a lot of overdoses . i bet you picked me up a couple of times . 
wow you musta seen some things huh ? what 's the worst thing you ever seen ? 
how long you been doing this ? 
you married ? 
like everybody else -- except us . always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks . your parents ... ? 
on yeah ? i went to holy name . where 'd you go to high school ? 
yeah or saint anthony . you from the neighborhood ? 
not as good as nino 's . 
my father was a great man you know . there was nobody he would n't help . you know that crazy guy noel who i gave water to last night ? he lived in our house for almost a year . a total stranger he 'd do anything for his own family though ... 
look i 'm sorry but it 's important to me . i mean a week ago i was wishing he was dead . and now i want hear his voice again just once more-- you know what i mean ? 
he 's better though right ? 
you sure ? i know my father would hate to be tied down . he would n't even go to the dentist . 
you ca n't kill my father that easy . he 'll fight forever . like with me : has n't talked to me in three years . but it 's okay . sometimes you have to put things behind you . 
i was going nuts in that waiting room so i came back to check on my mom . 
i know . it 's awful is n't it ? night of the living cheerleaders . 
i knew . i sensed it when i heard your voice . 
he 's better is n't he ? 
i 'll be right down . 
i 'd take her but then who would stay here ? 
my father 's in a coma now my mother 's going crazy . it 's like she 's in a trance . 
thing is i 'm supposed to be the fuckup . the one on the stretcher in there -- that 's supposed to be me . with my parents crying out here . i got a lot of guilt you know what i mean ? 
it 's crazy in there . what 's wrong with that doctor ? he keeps mumbling poking himself in the eye when he talks to me . 
did you see my father ? 
i think this place stinks . 
he 's dead huh ? 
that boy you brought in he was shot was n't he ? 
that 's my brother 's problem . he 's passed out inside . 
you should n't smoke . 
that 's what i told her . if she could just see him a second then i could take her home . 
right now i 'm more worried about my mother than anything . they wo n't let her see my father . 
i 'm not so sure . my father and i have n't spoken in three years . when my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack that he 'd locked himself in the bathroom all the way going over i was thinking how i was gon na tell him what a bastard he was . then when i got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed i thought of all these other things i wanted to say . 
i mean if he was dead i could handle that . 
it 's the waiting that 's killing me not knowing you know ? it 's really hard on my mother . the doctor does n't think my father'll make it . he says he was dead too long after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes close the door . 
it 's my first cigarette in over a year . 
it 's not so rare . he grew up on our street . he 's had a rough life and he 's a little crazy from it but that 's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water . 
is there any chance ? 
i know him . that 's noel . 
is he going to be alright ? 
john play the sinatra . 
i like it !   so doll what about you lately ? 
well we met about three months ago . he works at the surgeon general office . he loves boating .   so he 's been getting me into water skiing . 
i 'm going to take it . 
i think so ... they've been talking to me about being tom 's managing editor . 
you wo n't be able to stay mad at me right ? 
you are now required to sit here with me .   come on ... be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us ? 
i just want to sit here longer i mean the feeling is powerful -- why 's that ? 
you 're just trying to say all great stuff so i 'll feel even worse that you 're not around . 
tell me the god 's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me ? because if you are ... 
why not try it for a few weeks ? 
i just found out .   you did n't say anything to me ?   you just resign ? will you meet me now ? -- no now ! i 'm going away tomorrow .   please . 
bastard sneak quitter . 
do n't say anything about anything . 
sit down stop . 
you were quick enough to get tom 's help when ... 
i think you 're the devil . 
this is n't friendship . 
yeah -- being a basket case . 
yes i guess .   yes . 
this is important to me . 
i do n't know .   i may be in love with him . 
i told what 's his name -- tom -- that i 'd meet him . 
i have to be somewhere . 
if all that happened how come you 're so chipper ? 
there were complaining phone calls because you were sweating ? 
stop kidding .   i want to know what happened . 
what do you mean flop sweat ? -- you 're making too much out of it ... i'll bet you were the only one aware of it ... 
aaron will you tell me ? 
then what was good about it ? 
do others feel that you did well ? 
do you feel good about it ? 
did it really go well ? 
how 'd it go ? 
you too . 
okay great -- good luck . 
i 'm not sure i 'll be able to ... i ... 
well the line of the jacket -- no really .... just very nice ... just right . i wish i could be there . 
as good as humanly possible . 
it 's not a date .   it 's co - workers going to a professional conclave . 
i read about it -- that 's how you can make sure you do n't put on too much perfume ... 
did you bring your grey suit ? 
tom ... why do n't i meet you there ? i 've got some last minute stuff i 've got to take care of ... hey how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it ... i knew it . how much ?   wow ... okay ... see you there ... 
aaah --   -- ello .   you sure they said the management meeting ?   they want me to be at the management meeting . 
a long time .   i was restless . will you crack my neck ? 
you know you 've had a strange day ... i 'd sleep on all these things you 've been thinking . 
sounds like you may be on to something . 
well whatever you think . 
right and we have the ' 81 pilot on the way in -- nobody else will have him . 
thanks .   the f-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master .   oh you call them ' tomcats ' and in the 70 's the first crop had a number of crashes . 
i 'll come by your place right after ... drink take pills ... love you . 
i 'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from ? 
i write for you sometimes . 
to the pan of the supplies boxes -- 
of course . 
okay .   great line at the end . 
you spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap ...   oh good . 
if we do n't get to their camp soon we wo n't be able to tape the supplies coming in . 
oh god .   back it bobbie -- bobbie ? 
nine seconds . 
you want to start going over who they could have gotten ?   they ca n't take on people like this for network news .   for god 's sake .   what 's going on ? 
call if you get weird . 
good night . 
this conversation is not worthy of you . 
why do you say that ? 
no .   it makes me nervous to think about it .   let 's do this . 
a half hour in the lobby . 
at six o'clock on the wake - up news they used the wrong missile graphic . 
no i do n't .   he happens to deserve the credit .   he 's right here . 
aaron should be hearing this so i have an extra witness . 
but thanks . 
thanks .   i just wish you 'd kept the first twenty seconds . 
it 's started . 
what are you dressed up for ?   oh that 's right -- because the evening news is here this week . 
no i 'm not .   i 'm the fourth . joan richmond .   pauline fredericks got that credit once on a u.n. special and there 's susan zirinsky . 
did you hear what i just said -- do you have that ?   take a breath . 
tell george and jessica to try and cover everything without tom having to ask additional questions . 
yeah i know i went back and forth on it . 
i 'll never tell . 
yes there is . 
i 'll be right down .   it 's right tight . 
bobbie please . 
right there bobbie . 
no stop where he 's all besieged . 
just a two - second dissolve . 
okay bobbie just a two - second dissolve to the rockwell . 
let me hear it ! 
play back the last line ... 
please bobbie we 're pushing . 
go back to 316 bobbie .   the sound bite in the cab -- it starts ' i do n't know how i 'll feel ... ' 
nooo .   this way the rotation stays the same . 
i just have two more pen pals and then i 'm done . 
... am starting to get jealous . i read in the newspapers about the italian strike and riots in milan .   i hope you were n't ... 
fill for a second . 
no it 's awful .   oh my it 's awful . 
it 's not opinion . 
tom is n't ready for the job you 're about to hand him .   not near ready .   not by the longest shot .   aaron 's spent six weeks in tripoli he 's interviewed gaddafi -- he reported on the eight - one story .   i think he 's essential to do the job we 're capable of and i think it 's my responsibility to tell you that . 
i 'm sorry because i was looking forward to that but i ' m going back in a few hours . 
well there 's a guy but he says he 'll fly up a lot . 
i thought for ol' cliff here -- look at you ?   you 're more adorable than your pictures .   look what i got for you . 
well why not ?   hey what is this ?   my life 's rushing in front of my eyes . 
why did i have to do this to myself ?   watch you take off .   call me if you need anything . 
it 's better when you let me say it . 
it 's just that one of the few things i 'm not confused about is what i was saying downstairs that ... 
so you have an extra bathing suit huh ? 
it 's okay . 
you 're lucky i came after you so you got that off your ... 
i knew what you meant . 
i do n't wan to discuss work . 
that 's not going to be the way we say good - bye .   even though i think what you did was rotten -- it 's not all impersonal .   you mean something to me . 
it 's amazing .   you commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if i 'm nitpicking .   try and get this .   when you edited that ... 
it just proves that the difference we have are ... 
working up tears for a new piece cutaway ... you totally crossed the line between ... 
it made me ill .   you could get fired for things like that . 
jesus if you 're glib about this i 'm going to lose it .   i was up all night and ... 
of course it 's the reason .   it 's terrible what you did . 
i saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl .   i know you ' acted ' your reaction after the interview . 
you fucking ... 
that 's more than ' yes ' -- that 's ' you bet . ' 
well i just think that ' an extraordinary proposal . 
how can you say that to me ? 
that 's so perfectly ... it really makes me feel a little faint ...   whooo . 
no .   did he really ? 
i feel terrible about what happened . what did he say ? 
okay great grunick -- easy shots now -- huh ?   good night . 
good night ? ? ! 
uh - huh . 
i do n't know if that 's absolutely necessary . 
hi again .   sorry about ... 
it was n't as bad as he think was it ? -- it was n't unprecedented or anything ? 
i 'm not sure .   it seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news . 
i ca n't get away just yet .   i 'm at aaron 's . 
hi .   it 's me . 
okay .   sorry .   do n't yell at me like that again you scared the life out of me . 
he might be weird -- he can talk more freely if i go alone -- why 's that so hard to understand ? 
what happened ? 
no .   i 'll see you at your apartment as soon as i can . 
i forgot all about aaron .   i promised to stop by and see how he did . 
good ... another is you 're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else . 
three ... i just thought of a third ... if you talk about it you do n't have to do it . 
oh let 's see -- wait a minute well i can think of two reasons . 
right right -- is n't she fun to tease ? 
i was half hoping i would n't have a good time tonight .   you know why ? 
this is hysterical . 
at least kiss me when you do that . 
uh - uh . 
good .   that 's it ... see you . 
it moved me .   i did relate to it -- i really did .   it was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice ... but it 's real and it got me ... and i think a lot of the time i 'm too conservative about that kind of stuff .   okay ? 
so you like me huh ? 
oh good . 
uh - huh . 
why you need me for the story ? 
nooo .   is it your story ? 
says who ?   not important -- ha - ha - ha . i was dreaming -- oh no -- ca n't tell -- how embarrassing for me . gosh . 
i had to sleep fast so i took two allergy pills to help me ... i'm sorry ... hey you called me . 
jane yes .   tom ?   tom is that you ? is this tom ? 
yes tom -- i think i can manage . 
well what is it ? 
eventually .   does it have to be right now ? 
okay .   you did n't like the party huh ? 
i 'll get you through .   move and smile .   and smile and move ... 
it 's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you . 
i 'll be the judge of that . 
come on i 'll buy you a drink . there 's a big thing over at the italian embassy . 
hey i know how to have a burger by myself .   i feel like a little solitude . 
well i 'll go in and have a bite . 
well i thought i 'd check if all of you were still here .   i 'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on . 
i 'm going over to aaron 's .   maybe i 'll hoop up with all of you later .   how long do you think you 'll be there ? 
yeah .   it was an unusual place to be . 
we 're going to george .   say ' the joint chiefs are meeting -- we have george weln at the pentagon ' . 
yes .   just do n't say anything mean for a while .   thanks . 
well thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you . 
what do you mean clean ? 
some public official skipped a week on his christmas club ? 
give it to him -- so we can concentrate . 
i just got back -- i do n't know which end is up . 
how 's it going ? 
i ca n't help you sorry .   i 'm not here to teach remedial reporting . 
' really a lot appreciate it ... ' 
no .   aaron and i go to central america on wednesday -- so i 'm cramming . 
you were n't .   thanks .   how does it feel being here ? 
we 're working here ! !   you can stand over in the uh uh uh ... 
just what do you want from me anyway ? permission to be a fake ?   stop whining and do something about it . 
i agree with you -- you 're not qualified .   so get qualified .   you can insist on being better prepared .   you do n't have to just leave it as ...   ' i do n't write .   i 'm not schooled . i do n't understand the news i 'm reading . but at least i 'm upset about it folks . ' 
it 's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that i truly think is dangerous . 
so you 're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you ca n't write . 
well come on -- it is your life . nobody is tying you to the fast track .   did you go to college ? 
what about the obvious remedy ? reversing things .   maybe getting a job on a newspaper . 
i trust you . 
how are you at back rubs ? 
so great -- right ? 
i was doing sports at the station . the newspaper ran this untrue story that i was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail .   so they made me anchor . 
come on ... even i 'm not that hard on myself . 
yes .   my room is down here -- i 'm not tired .   do you want to keep talking ? 
nooo .   if i could just have a roll i 'd be okay . 
if we could just eat first . 
hi .   i was worried i was early . 
thank you .   they hated me .   i do n't hate them . 
right back to you . 
i ca n't be . 
god almighty -- whew .   do i mind ? why do i mind ?   i do mind .   what a shock -- i do n't have a right to ... i do n't think i like him .   i know i do n't respect him ... so what am i talking about -- what am i saying to you ? 
go ahead -- what ? 
i 'll pose any way you want . 
well i just wanted to make sure you know fully and completely that you 're never gon na get any from me at least in this lifetime . 
it 's just an innocent question .   besides i just wanted to clarify your intentions . 
are you a virgin ? 
walter can i ask you something ? 
a girl with a body like mine ? 
without a stitch of clothing on sitting and facing you ... 
when 's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room ... 
not even a little bit ? 
are you nervous walter ? 
that does n't look like very much clay . 
i 'm almost ready - 
it 's kind of dark - 
what right now ? 
well i 'm touched .   you 're serious are n't you ? 
well i 'm done talking to you what do i have to do draw you a diagram ! 
listen schmuck why do n't you get out of here and let me go to bed ! 
what are you doing here ? 
if you were an artist you could have created something ! 
oh yeah ? 
i 'd be glad to help .   for $ 50 an hour . 
would you like to do me ? 
do n't you work here ? 
walter ... stay away from me ! 
there's ... a body inside that statue ! 
walter ... there 's ... 
would you really like to ?   that would make me very happy . 
just about anything walter . 
forget it . 
jeez what is your problem all of a sudden ? 
because ...   we 're just friends .   that 's all . just friends . walter i get it .   i see the whole thing now . no one knows if walter paisley is born ! 
walter ...   i do n't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we 're ever going to get ... together .   you know what i mean ? 
now calm down walter !   now let 's go in there and when the show 's over maybe we can talk about it . 
walter i 'm sorry ... 
uh ...   ... how long have you been thinking about this walter ? 
what are you trying to say ? 
well that was for your sculpture of the girl .   your nude in the chair . 
i like you very much walter . 
of course i do ! 
oh i do n't know .   smart people . creative people i guess . 
well ... what did you want to talk to me about ? 
nice night out ... 
ready ?   we 've got plenty of time . 
thank you . 
tell us what you 're going to make next walter . 
every word ... 
yes walter . 
walter !   jeez ! 
where where ... 
more champagne your majesty ? 
well i ca n't say that walter !   she 's incomparable .   they 're both great . 
is it murdered man ? 
oh yeah ? 
what 's up walter ? 
these guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes . 
hi walter . 
now you 're a professional ! 
how did you ever find it all in yourself walter ? 
like it ?   it 's a masterpiece .   i 've never seen anything like it before ... and i hope i never see anything like it again . walter smiles and looks at his creation - 
you can do anything you want if you set your mind to it . 
let 's see it . 
look at the size of it ! 
it 's called spontaneity leonard . get with the program . 
what 's it called ? 
great !   what is it ? 
of course ... it 's wonderful . 
i 've never seen anything like this maybe segal but nothing with such ... dichotomy ...   it 's very good walter - 
do n't worry about him ... what have you got ? 
walter ... i ca n't believe it . 
when did you make this walter ? 
do n't worry it 's a non - dairy sauce made from soy milk . 
it was . 
here you go enjoy . 
that 's word for word . 
well it all depends leonard ... 
abstract ?   with his talent for realism ? 
that 's the idea walter .   it 's the only way to gain recognition . all the big art critics and art dealers would be there it would be an event . 
you 're right .   we should build a collection first . 
what 's wrong with you why do you want to hide it ? 
why not ? 
well then admit it it 's a work of genius . 
oh come on !   even you can see its value . 
i 've never seen anyone so ... squeamish .   well what 's your opinion leonard ? 
what 's the matter with you ? 
listen i 'm going over to walter 's after the place closes .   i want to get a look at murdered man .   do you want to come along ? 
are you alright ? 
when do we get to see it ? walter well ... any time i guess . 
are you trying to be funny ? 
leonard what are you doing ? 
maybe so ... 
hi walter ... 
i 'm trying to find a style of my own .   do you really like them ? 
do you have to be so cold to him ? 
andy start breaking up some chairs . you 'll need weapons . 
thanks .   have you seen jeffrey ?

he 's got a ...   what do you call it ? a napoleonic code . 
nice game .

i ... yeah i 'm okay .   i 'm fine . 
i am so sure . 
i think you 've forgotten something . 
have you ever thrown up in the front row of a richard marx concert ? 
we 've come all this way .   we just have to check it out .   i got a hunch . 
do n't be such a fraidy - cat . 
get away from me ! 
good thing one of us was prepared . 
you 're staying here .   some of them might not come after me .   if they do n't this place is gon na turn into a total stain . 
i 'm going out the front . 
i do n't actually think jeffrey 's gon na notice . 
i 'm glad you came . 
pretty shallow of you . 
leave me alone . 
right .   i 'm the chosen one .   and i choose to be shopping . 
he did what he was supposed to . 
i do n't want to kill anybody and i do n't want to talk about it anymore . 
it 's not a mixer .   it 's the senior dance .   and it 's important .   you would n't understand . 
in order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends . comprende ? 
i 'm going to the dance . 
i 'm going to the senior dance . 
for the dance . 
a dress . 
i 'm going shopping .   do n't try to stop me . 
oh god .   it 's him .   i think it 's him . 
pike i do n't think you 're up to this . 
why 'd you come back ? 
i did n't expect to see you . 
you sure ? 
i 'm kinda beat .   you can stay in my mom 's room if you want . 
it 's weird .   i went back to my old grade school once to the playground -- i used to hang out there all the time playing on the swings and stuff ... i went back and it was so tiny the whole place .   i could n't even fit on the swings .   everything just looked so small .   i 'm sorry .   i 'm babbling . 
three weeks ago all i thought about was ... well i did n't actually think about anything .   i definitely did n't expect this . 
things are kind of confusing . 
it 's nothing .   it does n't hurt . 
where are you gon na go ? 
well stay here tonight . 
you had a car full of stuff .   were you leaving ? 
not exactly . 
you want some water or something ? 
how are you doing ? 
is that your car ? 
you guys are thrashed . 
it could happen . 
like my homework . 
you 're weird and i 'm afraid of you . seriously cassandra there 's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework . 
bogutude .   blow it off . 
see cassandra likes it .   cassandra 's my friend . 
it has to be like a socially conscious theme . 
you look way pretty kim . 
i 'm glad you guys are here .   it 's good to see you . 
listen to you .   what language are you speaking ? 
kimberly it 's a dance .   it 's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that i see every stupid day . 
excuse me for having something important to do . 
look a lot 's been going on .   that 's what i wanted to tell you guys about . i need to tell you .   you see ... a while ago i met this guy -- 
i forgot . 
get a boob job . 
i did n't learn ... i just ... it 's not a big deal . 
kimberly it 's the senior dance . 
' just remember you 're in training son ' 
excuse much !   not rude or anything . 
sounds toasty .   we 're going pavilion .

why do n't we see a movie ? 
) what do you think ? 
he knows who i am ! 
and where are they now ? 
you 're learning .   slowly incredibly slowly but you 're learning . 
try and be inconspicuous okay ? act like a fan . 
toasty .   you should come ; it 's gon na be a great game . 
i 'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore .   come on merrick .   football .   afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left . 
why because it 's not my fate ?   it 's not in the book - of - all- knowledgefullness that i 'm gon na be cheerleading at the barber game ? 
make time okay ?   you 're the one who told me to act normal .   i 've missed three practices already .   if i 'm not there for the barber game tomorrow everyone 's gon na talk . 
i kind of had to improvise .   sorry about your guitar . 
okay .   the important thing is not to panic . 
well you 're on my turf now .   you 're just gon na have to trust me . 
because you clash merrick .   you clash with everything .   i mean you might as well go around with a sign ' slayers trained her . '   honestly you look like something out of ... pasadena . 
we call them zippers .   they 're not supposed to be a challenge . 
i mean most of the time jeffrey 's really sweet but sometimes he gets kind of ... ' me - tarzan'ish you know what i mean ?   lately it bugs me i guess .   merrick ?   are you still breathing ? 
merrick .   you made a joke .   are you okay i mean do you want to lie down ?   i know it hurts the first time . 
well ... there 's my keen fashion sense for one . 
well you know i 'm not gon na kick so easy .   i 've got a few things the other girls did n't have . 
and it makes it worse when i die right ? 
i 'm curious is all . 
i wish you would . 
how can you keep doing this ? 
so basically i 've got the life expectancy of a zit right ? 
oh fuck you ! 
and why are you always wearing black ? it 's so down .   it 's totally not your color .   i do n't think you have a color . 
are n't i like the chosen one ?   the one and only ?   the grand high poobah and does n't that mean you have to be nice to me ?   like ever ? 
a wet !   did n't i just kill that vampire ?   i think i did .   i did n't see you killing any vampires .   you were too busy playing ' beat the clock ' . 
you are such a wet . 
oh wonderful .   my secret weapon is - pms .   that 's just great .   thanks for telling me . 
nice conversationalist !   yeah i felt 'em a little but i ai n't due for two weeks since you 're so excited about the subject . 
does the world ' duhh ' mean anything to you ? 
what ! ? ! 
they were vampires ?

if i say ' no ' does that make me a bad person ? 
toasty .   were there ever any like famous vampires ? 
what about bats ?   do they turn into bats ? 
ooh another embarrassment for the teabag while the chosen one is still well under par . 
no ... i guess i would have gotten jeffrey to hit you . 
put your head back . 
oh .   sorry . 
last night .   you knew i was sitting on a fresh grave did n't you ? 
i do n't want to be the chosen one okay ?   i do n't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires !   i just want to graduate from high school go to europe marry charlie sheen and die .   it may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you but i think it 's swell .   and then you come along ...   and ... and then i 'm a member of the hairy mole club so you throw things at me ! 
but you threw a knife at my head ! 
oh what the hell is wrong with you ?   you threw a knife at my head ! 
no .   you do n't do anything .   i do it . 
no -- you do n't have to --

you know just because you 're having full - on wiggans does n't mean you have to drag us into it .   this is n't just any dance .   it happens ot be the last dance of our last year .

oh thank you very much .

i got ta bail .   you coming ? 
well that 's the thing .   she landed on her feet .   did n't even sprain a toe .   and i go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she 's like this -- 
snapped .   buffy was you know on the upswing and i swear to god she went across the room .   perm over heels . 
buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good ; coach said she could have been in the olympics -- but she was doing a routine spinning and the beam broke . 
nee sitch .   no way . 
it 's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch . 
and the january semi - formal -- 
except for prom . 
so we 're stupid now ? 
like you 've got a grip . 
what are you talking about ? 
i 'm like yelling at her ' what are you doing ? '   and she 's going ' jeffrey jeffrey ! '   way mental . 
i really was way way too too . 
seriously buffy .   that look was way twisted .   what were you thinking about ? 
nice much . 
well look who 's here . 
if we do n't invite all the seniors we ca n't use the school funds you know that . 
environment .   that 's cool with me . 
the homelesses ? 
god !   take a chill lozenge . 
oh god . 
ebby calvin nuke laloosh -- don't think too much . 
neither will i. 
well i guess this is it . 
that 's great ! 
it 's skip for you . 
--but you 're father 's in there ! 
so am i.   nuke honey we need to talk-- 
you do n't have to ... 
oh -- won't you come in ? 
it 's okay .. 
he did ? 
what 'd he say ? 
nuke !   you got things all wrong ! there 's no relation between sex and baseball .   ask crash . 
cute ? !   i hate cute !   baby ducks are cute !   i wanta be exotic and mysterious ! 
of course i 'm seducing you for godsakes and i 'm doing a damn poor job of it--   are n't i pretty ? 
i 'm trying to play with your body ! 
oh ...   crash is a very smart man .   now c'm on honey give it a try . 
what a nasty thing to say . 
yes i do ... 
sure .   unsnap my stockings . 
i figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we do n't make love . 
that 's my leg . 
i 'm not gon na try to seduce you sweetie ... 
i 'll tuck you in . 
how 'bout a back rub ? 
i 'm so proud of you and all the guys .   want some more soup ? 
get over here . 
nuke ? ! 
now do n't go overboard i look incredibly hot right ? 
breathing through your pingala always works honey-- 
i 'm yours . 
yes .   and so is birth .   now look me in the eyes nuke--   you have n't been wearing my panties have you ? 
oh do n't be silly .   death is nothing to be scared of .   it 's just another way of living .   it 's just a fresh start -- kinda like spring training . 
it 's all the same thing . 
much better .   your delivery was fully integrated because you were n't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me .   this is progress . 
a little better . 
he 's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six . 
you 're patronizing me !   i will not be patronized-- 
right .   okay fire a couple in there . 
the pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball .   and if you discover before a game you 're in the wrong nostril it 's easy to switch . 
the ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril . 
the right nostril .   good . 
just do what i say .   now which nostril are you breathing through ? 
good .   total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous .   let 's play catch . 
they did when they were in the carolina league . 
you 've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain .   these 'll help move things to the right side . 
they 'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you 'll start seeing things differently -- plus they 'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters . 
i want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch . 
there is a lot of things you never thought of sweetie -- now get some rest for tonight 's game . 
y'know if you make it to the bigs you could still become the host of dance fever .   baseball 's a good stepping stone for things like that . 
you can learn to like it . 
you see how nice things are when we go slow ? 
would you rather me be making love to him using your name or making love to you using his name ? 
honey do n't ever listen to a woman when she 's making love . they 'll say the strangest things . 
we all deserve to wear white . 
no no -- i'm fine .   millie how much time did you and jimmy spend together before he proposed ? 
omigawd honey i 'm so happy for you . 
well let 's get down to it honey-- how was he ? 
that 's better .   got the radar ready ? 
--millie you 've got to stay out of the clubhouse .   it 'll just get everybody in trouble . 
i can do that too . 
not yet .   it takes years of practice ... 
salem massachusetts ?   where all the witches were ? 
i 'm quitting too .   boys not baseball . 
what happened ? 
it does n't work like that .   god you 're gorgeous .   want to dance ? 
...   so you see in a former lifetime i 'm sure that i was alexandria the czarette of russia ? what do you think ? 
i heard already . 
well ... i used to think that was n't the worst thing in the world to look forward to .   lately i 'm not so sure . 
it 's true it 's true !   least it used to be true .   it ai n't possible that baseball 's not enough anymore is it crash ? 
if you know where home plate is then you know where 1st base is and 2nd and everything else-- 'cause they 're always in the same place in relation to home .   do n't you see ?   if you know where home plate is then you know where everything else in the universe is ! 
thurman munson .   he was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody -- it was beautiful ...   and he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition !   so i stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what 's so great about baseball . 
i crossed the street -- it was the new york yankees spring training field -- tok tok tok was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and i sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother ...   and i saw him . 
i was raised in a baptist church got dipped in the water when i was 5 - - born again before kindergarten ... by the time i was 10 i knew it was bullshit and at 15 i ran away from home ... 
god damn you -- what is happening ? is there no man who 'll have me ?   this is the weirdest season i ever saw -- the durham bulls ca n't lose and i ca n't get laid ! 
i said when i think about you i get wet . 
i 'm ready for a complicated man . 
crash i get wet just thinking about you . 
i do n't imagine there 's much i could teach you . 
i teach part time at the junior college .   what if i told you i was through with nuke ?   he learned his lessons quickly and left me . 
i want you desperately ! 
he wo n't make love to me anymore . 
i want to be had . 
do n't you think i 'm pretty ? 
he ' s confused-- 
crash ... i want you . 
i 'm not a real batter .   i 'm a woman . 
you got me all confused . 
despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most judao - christian ethics i am within the framework of a baseball season monogamous . 
oh no i think it 'd be great ! the sporting news should know about it . 
why not ?   if you hit twenty homers this year you 'll be the all time minor league champ !   the record 's 
but they 're nice hips .   i looked up your records-- you 've hit 227 home runs in the minors . that 's great ! 
i 'm committed to nuke for the season .   you had your chance the other night . 
but you were pulling your hips last night . 
i think thomas pynchon 's a genius . 
see my hips ? 
i 'm not interested yet . 
wait crash -- don't go -- all i want is a date .   i 'm not gon na fall in love with you or nothin' . 
oh my ...   do n't leave ... 
what do you believe in ? 
actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other . it 's all quantum physics and molecular attraction .   there are laws we do n't understand that bring us together and break us apart . 
these are the ground rules .   i hook up with one guy a season-- i mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy -- kinda my own spring training ...   and well you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far .   so ...   i thought we should get to know each other . 
crash i did n't think you-- 
i do n't trust a man who do n't dance .   it ai n't natural . 
annie savoy .   wanta dance ? 
oh no -- he 's shaking off the sign jackson .   big mistake ... 
he looks wonderful jackson ... 
that 's not necessary jackson---   okay nuke now lean in for the sign . 
oh dear .... easy honey ... 
it says he 's not bending his back on his follow - through . 
take this to ebby in the dugout between innings . 
he looks great just great ! 
three - fourteen ?   hmmm ...   look't those thighs jackson 
number twenty - two 's thighs are just great .   who 's he ? 
she will mr.   laloosh she will ... 
oh let 's not ... 
praise the lord eh ? 
he 's a good student . 
uh oh ...   can i offer you some coffee ? 
well he sort of pitches for the cosmic all - stars . 
sweetie have you ever heard of walt whitman ? 
you think dwight gooden leaves his socks on ? 
no no honey ...   first the shoes and socks . 
when you know how to make love you 'll know how to pitch .   shh .   i love this part . 
no no no .   put it back on and take it off slowly . 
you 're a regular nuclear meltdown honey -- slow down . 
oh both of you of course ...

i 'm aware of that . we do n't have to turn this into a big deal .   okay ? we do n't have to have a fight . it was important to me . but forget it . just something i wanted to do for myself .

that 's - yeah he 's sitting by the phone like a dumb - bell just waiting for you to call him back . that 's what he 's - 
so he knows where you are . that means he 's sending some guys over here probably right now .

then do it the way you want . 
you are right . what can i ... 
you 'll get a heart attack like that . 
take it easy though . 
i know it i know it . 
i know but that 's enough . 
all right take it easy now take it easy . 
that 's enough . 
there 's a lot of people here . 
since when do you talk like that ? 
what 's the matter with you ? 
hey ! oh ! 
i thought you said you were n't a very good liar . 
in many ways that obnoxious creep cactus was the worst one of all . he got off on giving out pain ... 
it would be honor brock . now let 's go get this guy ... 
oh now you put up a good fight . let 's change the subject . where do people who live in oasisburg go to get away from it all ? 
a couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together .   thank you jeff . 
no - o. you know questions like that do n't help your cause-- 
hmm . not bad . 
tonight somewhere in the city innocent people will die -- but then one of you knows that ; for one of you is a vicious pirate - terrorist posing as the beloved superhero captain god . 
uh brock today you are without me ... 
at some sanctimonious celebration of condescension . nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon . 
i 'm sure . 
well it 's just that i would think that the woman who is the real non- imitation catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea . really angry . 
a whip ?   now that 's going too far !   some of these women have no shame ! 
no it 's not . 
i 'm sorry i went off like that i get passionate . i -- i guess i 'm a passionate person . one of those things i had forgotten .   when you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero ? 
i checked out your stuff at the library .   awesome work really . why would someone like you want to go out with a ... with a .. what exactly am i again ? 
oh it 's superb -- i mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing ... 
you designed gotham plaza ?   the big silver guys pulling on those big silver things ... 
i 'm not afraid . are you ? 
but of course you are . dinner at eight .   would n't miss it . 
how heroic of you ... 
you 're probably right . 
nothing just a jolt of deja - vu . i think i went out with a guy with a dignified british butler -- can't remember how it turned out .. 
i wonder .. 
i do n't know . i ca n't remember . 
guilty . i am . 
i 'll bet . funny for some reason i do n't think dogs are supposed to like me . 
in women ? 
oh frank i 'm not anti - male i 'm anti- you . believe me there 's a difference .   kelly is designing new uniforms for next week . pay her and thank her . and is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning .   there 's something out there called 73 degrees look into it . 
can i be frank frank ?   your entire existence is sexual harassment . i accept there 's not much you can do about it . 
what 's the good news ? 
i 'll let you know . 
have you seen the oasisburg police ? they drive golf carts with little red sirens . 
you know now that i hear myself tell it i 'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me . what you get the helmet monday through thursday then brock takes it for the weekend ... 
then there 's you louis sneaking through back alleys and surprise visiting me at my home .. both of you have been way too frisky from the get- go . i 'm actually a pretty amazing person -- funny smart attractive when i get my sleep -- but you two had no way of knowing that-- when i met you both i was basically a morose depressed amnesiac incapable of any human feeling . the only reason one of you wanted to go out with me is because you knew i was catwoman . 
i 'm not through . this will come as a shock . again to one of you . i am catwoman . the catwoman . 
you are ... 
i give up . i give up.--i ca n't figure you out . not gon na try . 
hey i thought ... 
i said i saw you last night . what were you doing hiding in that alley running off when the superhero alarm sounded ... 
like you do n't know ... 
nothing . how 's your hand ? 
did you try to kill ... 
oh do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you ? 
you turned around ! 
hey captain god ! 
next time call ... 
well . i 'd let you come in but the place is a mess ... 
ah !   you scared me !   how did you know to come here !   have you been spying .. 
i am . dinner with brock leviathan ... 
but of course you are . 
i actually got some memory back last night . 
yeah she 's okay . 
i do n't know what came over me . 
what if i say i 'll go out with you so you can have all these great daydreams but then never actually talk to you again ? 
but i 'm blind . 
i do n't know if i can do it alone . 
but i 'm not a hero . i 'm nobody 's heroine .. i'm nothing . you 've said so yourself many times . 
mom not now !   i i do n't know what to do .. 
they 're going to attack frank 's fun palace ! 
i never thanked you .. the arrow .. the motorcycle .. the computer disc .. you're so different from what i .. and so the same . 
mom ?   oh mom i messed up ... 
it 's because i did n't come in . i live in the hut now . i meant to tell you .. see ya . 
uh it 's just -- that woman out there-- that horrible hag . she 's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter -- and now she 's built a hut in the back .. why did you ... 
i 'll take your abuse but it 's way too early for the sanctimonious cult of gag ... 
pretty good ... mom i do n't want you to think i do n't appreciate ... letting me stay getting me the job -- i've been a mess . i 'm still a mess . it 's just ... we have to start having a different conversation . i ca n't take .. 
oh mommy you 're embarrassing me . 
a hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning ... 
yes mother . dear . 
nice breasts . 
you going to talk all day ? 
the kicks .. the rush .. you mean like pulling heists .. faking your own deaths .. killing innocent bystanders ... like mexican angels .   i know you 're a woman . do you ? 
you seem sad spooky . 
what 's it like being a superhero ?   it must be frightfully exciting .. how did you guys all get together ? 
oh pooh come now . if you turn me down i just might throw a fit .. you know how us girls can be .. 
what 's a powerful man like you standing all alone for ?   dance with me ? 
trust me you wo n't have to . 
do you always listen to what your mother says ?   selina . something you choose your life . sometimes your life chooses you .   save the day .. 
yes you do . you have to go rescue all those people ... 
i hate it when you let your hair just hang like that ... you have such pretty eyes ... 
yes i 'm pretty amazing . you should see this ... it came this evening . 
where were you last night ?   i did n't hear you come in . 
do n't sneak up on me ... 
oh so now even the keepers of the city do n't meet your standards ... you're late . 
oh i forgot to tell you you 're on a diet ... the fact you 're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you . 
you 're late . 
i wo n't let him .   he belongs to me now .   bye sweetie . 
i 'm sure he 'll be heartbroken . 
taking messages . 
do n't you have children ? 
do i hear a woman 's voice ? 
i 'll see that he stays calm .   pack the money up and put it in the trunk . 
put those away .   we ca n't have marks on his wrists . 
i prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location .   once nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies . 
with all those holes nels pumped in i knew you would n't suffocate . 
what else did you expect him to say ?   do it theo -- or give me the gun . 
he 's seen both of us now . 
we 've had our share of fuck - ups but it 's going to work out fine . 
any minute . 
he took it like a man .   toss him in that drainage ditch . 
allow me . 
lose the hardware now . 
nels do n't let that cop pass you . 
i 'm doing fine .   theo wants to deal . 
i told you ... sooner or later you 'd have to trust me ... 
my fence in san francisco ... 305 - 4410 .   maurice .   do n't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds . 
i 've got ... one last number for you theo ... 
-- the phones theo .   do n't leave any of them behind .   the cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you . 
i picked the wrong number when i chose you ... did n't i ? 
five ... six . 
pull over !   pull over someplace . 
you wo n't live to see it . 
take your hand out of there . slowly . 
local lawyer for dominican dealers .   off to buy a half interest in a mall in granada hills on their behalf . 
took preparation . 
that 's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living . i must 've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute . 
both hands on your lap . 
he let the fucking cop out -- but he wo n't -- 
that 's not good enough . 
only one way to find out . 
you 're the man with the gun . 
we ca n't leave him to repeat anything . 
he might 've heard everything we said in the car . 
the cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive . 
sooner or later you 'll learn to trust me . 
we had a backup plan .   but i knew you 'd come through for me . 
as a child i hated being told how sweet i looked .   that angelic little face was n't me at all .   i had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image . sometimes words were enough -- but i was n't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously .   i enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who i was .   that same look you gave me when i turned the gun on you . 
why are we stopping ? 
sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here . 
i thought it was inspired . 
as they say -- no good deed goes unpunished . 
they always pick rachel up early on thursday . 
plus they 'll remember you going after his daughter at school . 
the video cameras will put you with him in the bank and i 'll bet there were enough witnesses . 
jack oberfeld in person .   did you kill him ? 
it belongs to the man you took it from .   or should i saw < u > stole</u > it from ? 
there is n't any such person . 
the rest of the money is here in the car .   why do n't you come and get it ? 
he had a gun .   i have it now . 
hand me the phone . 
they put their hands all over me . 
they tortured us .   and you 're going to let them have all that money ? 
you 're going to let them get away with this ? 
why did n't you just shoot them ? 
she 'll never be the same .   none of us will . 
rachel was terrified when i left her .   i could see it in her eyes . 
it 's locked . 
rachel -- oh my god . 
i 'm sorry .   you 've thought this out better than i ever could .   i 'm ready now . 
all right .   now that you explain it i see that you 're right . 
why ca n't it be her ? 
yes .   but i want rachel to come with me . 
i ca n't do it . 
i 'm not leaving my daughter behind .   not with them . 
yes sir . 
he 's in back .   lying face down . they have n't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying .   i never heard jack cry before -- 
she 's awake but she has n't spoken . i do n't know what they did to her . i do n't want to think about it . 
they wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles . 
thank you .   god bless you for helping us . 
they 're tied with duct tape so they ca n't speak -- but they seem to be -- 
god if he does n't come back -- 
what did you do ? 
they dragged me downstairs .   i thought they were going to kill me . 
yes ?   yes ? 
no .   i hear them .   they 're coming upstairs .   they know ! 
downstairs .   there must be an extension .   oh my god -- 
yes -- i think so .   another crossed line ? 
when they first started questioning jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me .   and they began beating him .   and i watched .   and i did n't feel anything ... what kind of a person am i ? 
because you 're probably the last person i 'll ever talk to . 
jack has n't loved me for years . and now i 'm afraid she 's turning out to be like him .   so cold and distant .   i 've let him make her like that . 
but i guess we have n't really met -- have we ? 
theo i want you to know you 're probably the most decent man i 've ever met . 
if it 's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants .   tufts you know .   it still has n't grown fully in .   the other one is from the islands .   braided hair -- very dark . 
the front door slammed .   someone went out .   there 's a different car starting . 
do n't talk .   do n't talk ! 
to hide it from the i.r.s. 
oh my god .   i heard her scream again .   what are they doing to her ?   why ca n't i do anything to stop them ? 
it 's not hard to do .   i do it all the time . 
jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago . 
i 'm not supposed to -- but i do . millions in cash and bearer bonds . 
do n't say that . 
jack will negotiate with them . he 'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they 'll let rachel go . 
even if you found us -- what then ? 
i heard someone pulling in behind the house .   i heard rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden .   i do n't know what they did to her . 
what do you mean ? 
the city national on san vincente . 
the one in brentwood . 
when jack sees they 've got rachel he'll tell them what they want to know . 
it 's not your fault theo .   you tried . 
do n't say anything .   do n't alarm them .   just go ! 
what 's happening ? 
that 's not her . 
i can hear you again clearly . 
make a right .   you ca n't miss it . 
i 've lost you .   you 're gone .   i ca n't hear anything . 
you 're breaking up .   i ca n't hear you .   theo ? 
i have no right to ask for help . i 've never thought of anybody but myself . 
i was n't always like that .   i do n't think i was . 
i did n't mean to .   it 's just the way i am . 
i 'm afraid if i stop talking i 'll lose you .   just name any reasonable amount and it 's yours . 
i suppose if you 're a struggling artist you need a patron . 
i did n't mean to insult you . you 're an artist . 
our house always needs touching up . 
what do you do for a living ? 
i 'm sorry if i caused you to lose your business deal . 
and that was the end of it ? 
i did n't mean to open up any old wounds . 
a woman ? 
why did n't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me ? 
how much time do you have left on it ? 
they say she resembles me -- dark hair ponytail very dark eyes . they all wear the same uniform .   please .   be careful .   the man driving the car must have a gun . 
forget about us .   just save rachel . 
what are you doing now ? 
what about the others ? 
will you please speak to me ! theo ? 
why is n't anyone answering me ? 
she would if she heard my voice on the phone . 
26th off wilshire . 
he 's right .   you 'll get my whole family killed . 
they do n't know you .   they wo n't listen . 
the bigger man is driving our mercedes to the school .   rachel will recognize the car .   she 'll get right in . 
they know jack will give them what they want once they have her . 
rachel my daughter .   she 's an honor student at parker .   my god she 's only nine . 
rachel !   they 're going after rachel now -- and i ca n't stop them . 
they just walked out .   the smaller man -- he must be dominican or haitian -- he kicked me so hard . i felt a rib crack but i never made a sound .   it 's starting to hurt now -- real bad .   a throbbing .   i ca n't even take a deep breath . 
i hear them coming upstairs .   i wo n't be able to talk for awhile . i have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep .   so do n't talk .   do n't say a word or they 'll hear it . 
no do n't .   you could lose me for good .   do n't go through that tunnel . 
then they took the mercedes away -- with his body in it . 
elliot -- our driver .   the officer put his gun to the back of elliot 's head and -- fired .   it was so quick . 
he pulled us over as we left the riviera tennis club .   claimed we 'd run a stop sign .   and when elliot was reaching for his license -- 
one of them < u > is</u > a cop . 
no !   no police .   they 'll know right away the authorities are looking for us .   they 'll kill us . we 've seen their faces . 
no -- nothing . 
i have no idea .   they put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows .   the shutters up here are nailed shut . 
they tortured my husband .   made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts .   once they get what 's in the safe deposit box they 'll kill us . 
then hang up !   do it ! 
because you know you 'll be killing us . 
you wo n't disconnect . 
i realize you do n't want to be involved . 
my name is lenore oberfeld . 
my name is -- 
i do n't believe you . 
i 'm sorry .   i 'm so sorry to do this to you . 
absolutely . long as she can keep it . is n't that right james ... 
a bit heavy on the powder is n't she jimmy ?

i sincerely hope so .

some judge ... 
stay late at your work tomorrow night and i 'll bring you the gear . 
fergus i think you do n't trust me . 
we 'll be on the other side . we 'll move when you do . 
you were made for this . 
you know what . go . 
aye . then we 'll leave her be . 
come on fergie . a rehearsal . 
och you do fergie . 
so i suppose a fuck is out of the question . keep your head down fergus . no sudden moves . and not a whisper to her . you 'll be hearing from us . 
jesus fergus you 're a walking cliche . you know we wo n't leave her out of this . but i 'm glad to see you care . 
you 're never out fergus . 
we 've got some plans here . and we 'll need a mister nobody to execute them . 
you vanished quite effectively . became mister nobody . and you 've no idea how useful that could be . 
but you know what the thing is fergus ? 
so you did fuck up . 
we had a court - martial in your absence . they wanted to put a bullet in your head . i pleaded for clemency . said we should find out what happened first . so what did happen ? 
maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth . no thanks to you .... what you think of the hair ? 
eddie and tinker died . 
no . that 's the last thing i 'll do . you never asked what happened . 
what was it fergus ? did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up ? 
does n't matter if he 's hot . just cover the fucker up . 
put that thing back on him fergus . 
my pleasure . 
someone 's got to do it . 
fucking do . i had him all over me . 
he 's all right . 
ca n't . 
there are certain things i would n't do for my country . 
horny bastard . 
do you want some food ? 
i said shut the fuck up -- 
you 're heading for trouble fergus -- 
you shut your face -- 
it was fun while it lasted . 
see if we took the hood off we 'd have to shoot you . as it is you 've got a fifty - fifty chance . 
come and get me soldier -- 
people . they could be looking . 
you never know . 
not here . 
tell me jody 
you did n't ? 
you 'd know i would n't run off . 
you do n't know me do you ? 
the teddy bear ? 
you 're crazy -- 
no we are . 
leave him alone peter . he 's in love . 
you 're crazy . do n't let him peter . 
we will separate -- you look over there . 
what 's the matter chérie ? 
the stamp market of course -- it is here every thursday afternoon . this is where jean - louis trades his -- 
he was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning . he said he had never seen any like them . 
hello reggie -- i am waiting for jean - louis . 
oh la vache ! 
do n't be silly -- he would not do anything . he is not yet old enough to be interested in girls . he says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age . 
what is it about ? 
who is it from ? 
he 's allergic to him . 
he must have known charles pretty well . 
do you know him ? 
have you no idea who could have done it ? 
at least he knows how to behave at funerals . 
did n't charles have any friends ? 
he knows everything . 
with a rich husband and this year 's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends . 
but that is no reason to get a divorce ! 
but why do you want a divorce ? 
but what ? 
ça alors ! from charles ? 
va jouer mon ange . 
nothing . i just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you . you did n't say goodbye . 
no i was n't . 
who is she daddy ? 
you know her ? 
she said she was kenny 's aunt lisa . 
it was a she . 
i thought you 'd be pleased . 
you are upset . 
daddy are you upset that i 'm still a virgin ? ! 
not much further . 
daddy ! i don't think this is any of your business ! 
a little . 
well yeah . of course . everyone kisses . 
what do you mean ? 
what 's wrong ? 
i will . is that all ? 
no . those two were together before kenny and i started hanging out and that 's over what god a year now . 
i 've been in the same class with stacy for years but we were n't tight or anything . 
i 'm fine . i 've just never had someone my age die before . it 's so weird . 
hi daddy . hi mr. sisler . 
dad ! most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends ! 
it wo n't happen again . 
what ? i was at sandy 's i just lost track of time . 
daddy you scared me ! 
please ! you would n't kill your sister would you ? 
you 're the killed . 
_ your father raped someone ? 
what do you know about my father ? 
me ? why me ? 
you think i should go to the party mr. marliston ? 
of course i 'm scared . 
you know about that too ? 
ok . should i put my bike in the back of your car ? 
i am . 
i ca n't right now . 
did n't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time ? 
you 're thinking of sleeping with mark tonight ? 
i wo n't . 
what party ? 
fine . are you ? 
someone tried to kill me . 
no ? ! 
not that many . 
sandy you have to chill out at least two - thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins . he ca n't butcher all of us . 
i promised i 'd go right home after school . 
how do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you . 
i do n't know what i 'm so scared of . 
you 're the one always saying ' just do it ' . 
maybe i should blister through a bottle of tequila and just fuck his brains out . 
he says he loves me . 
i was desperate . it was gross . 
does she fuck ? 
but you ca n't do any of it . so it sucks . i always have to ' set an example ' . 
you are ' sp fucking ' wrong . 
you could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars . 
you 're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now . 
you eventually have to talk to him . 
you stare at him non - stop like every lunch . like this . like most people stare at car accidents . 
do n't you want to talk to him ? you watch him eat everyday . 
mark shale . 
go sit next to him . 
you miss dunlop ? 
do n't you think it 's sick ? 
you heard about that ? 
this place is empty . 
twenty eight years ago . 
hi miss dunlop . where do you keep the old town papers ? 
what are you doing ? 
oh god it 's him ! 
thanks for coming back for me . 
go to the police station ! 
my dad 's down there ! 
then go to the party . run with the herd kenny . just do n't spew out all that ' be an individual assert yourself ' crap anymore . 
this party is sick . 
and when i finally agree to spread my legs you accuse me of treating you like meat . 
you flaunt some slut in my face . 
you break up with me because i wo n't fuck you . 
i 'm making you feel like meat ? 
what 's wrong ? am i doing something wrong ? 
let 's just start a party right here right fucking now . 
so i should feel happy that he got away with it ? 
i ca n't believe i listened to one word of his shit . 
my dad acts like he 's johnny fucking perfect and he 's really johnny fucking rapist . 
i 'll think about it . 
i have to go home after school . i have something really important i have to ask my mom . 
i do not . 
i 'm not using him as an excuse . 
no i 'm really grounded . when i got in late the other night my father was waiting up for me . 
i 'm so flattered but i ca n't . i 'm grounded . 
did sharon say no ? 
three of our classmates are dead . that 's not really the occasion for a party . 
yeah . i think it 's really sick . 
i did . 
i 'm fine . 
i got to get home . 
i was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago . 
cut it out . 
that 's why he called mr. sisler first . he was one of them . 
who was the fourth ? 
the principal ? 
you 're not telling me something . 
the men . do any of them still live around here ? 
who were they ? 
the word is mob . 
how could you ? 
and the police did nothing ? 
people thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them ' queers ' ? 
why not ? 
you did n't believe her ? 
attacked how ? 
i 'm not leaving . i want to know why you and dad are so freaked out . three of my classmates are dead . 
whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of lisa sherman clothes and all . i think that concerns me . 
who is she ? 
the library . i 'll be fine . 
no . i think she lived her a long time ago . like twenty - eight years ago . when dad was eighteen . 
no but he got really weird . like i 've never seen him act . really angry and super uptight . 
that 's what he said . 
i overheard daddy mentioning her to someone . i he thinks she 's the killer . 
yeah . who is she ? 
have you ever heard of someone named lisa sherman ? 
i need to ask you something . 
hi mom . 
his mother 's an only child . 
on what side of the family ? 
kenny 's aunt ? 
this will relax her . 
did you warn her ? 
she just turned off her light . 
what happened ? 
not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened . we both have ... 
mr. sisler was one of them . 
two men left town right after it happened . 
i 've regretted it ever since . never run with the herd just because they 're the herd . 
i do n't know . we just did . i guess i was kind of scared going against the gain . against the whole town . 
everyone just kind of looked the other way . 
they were proving to her they were n't . they were very drunk . things were different back then . you think kids are sexually bottled up today .... 
they were children of our leading citizens stars of the football team . and she was   a loner . an angry girl that no one really liked . she 'd called them ' queers ' . 
no i believed her . she was in pretty bad shape . inside and out . but the boys were never formally charged . 
she was raped . at least that 's what she claimed . 
years ago something horrible happened in this town . when i was still in high school . a girl named elizabeth sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors . 
do n't make me order you . 
she 's nobody you should be concerned with . 
i want you to come home with me right now jody . 
where are you going ? 
not that i know of . 
i 've never heard of her . maybe something else was on his mind . 
did he say anything else about her ? 
i do n't know . where did you hear that name . 
lisa sherman ? 
you can ask me anything . 
hi princess . 
you 're not ? 
jody you have to go to the party . for your own safety . 
kenny'll want to go with you . cindy 's holding a q and a session at the bleachers . come on . 
i kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together on the same night . it 'll be a lot less scary . you have to go . 
unless he makes a move during seventh period . 
it 's like a pop your cherry party . everyone 's saying it 's ' fuck or die ' time . 
especially not your dad . 
you ca n't tell your parents . 
shh . ben 's party . tonight . have n't you heard ? 
mark invited me to the party . 
hurricane hormone . it 's flattened the whole school . guess what ? 
you ok ? 
the phone just went dead . i called the police and ran right over as fast as i could . 
you watch . there 's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow . maybe i 'll finally talk to mark shale . 
there will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night . 
ok . increase the peace . 
i keep a couple of my dad 's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference . 
want to come in for awhile ? log onto aol flirt with some married men head into a private s&m chat room . . . 
that was before he pulled this ' dick me or i dump you ' shit . i say fuck his best friend . 
personally i think he has a deep almost pathological desire to corrupt you . but i suppose that 's a type of love . i certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me . 
kenny'll come running back . this is just his way of pressuring you . 
oh nice save . 
i doubt it . who 'd want to fuck her . she probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties . 
he 's just trying to mess with your head . ignore him . 
you get to be a little chelsea clinton . everyone wants to meet you . party with you . have sex with you . 
you 're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff . 
what am i supposed to say ? ' nice sweater mark ' ? ' did you buy it at eddie bauer 's ? ' 
no ! that 's his table . 
why ? all my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they 've been married for twenty years . 
the seat behind him is open . come on i can eavesdrop too . 
i do n't watch him eat everyday . 
you 're the one who 's hand is shaking . 
so are you .

... he had a breakdown ... the dam broke ... my mother died ... he became a little boy ... i was fifteen ... he 'd ask me what to eat for breakfast what clothes to wear ! ... it happened ... then i ran away ... 
she 's my sister and my daughter ! 
she 's my sister . 
she 's my daughter . 
... no ... 
i do n't know what you 're talking about . this is the most insane ... the craziest thing i ever ... 
what are you saying ? 
i do n't know . i mean yes probably . 
what the hell is this all about ? 
what did you do that for ? 
what are you doing ? what 's wrong ? i told you we 've got a 4:30 . 
yes we 've got a 4:30 train to catch . why ? 
... she 's having a bath now ... why do you want to see her ? 
upstairs . why ?

did you get some sleep ? 
... that 's not what i meant . 
are n't you coming back with me ? 
i ca n't ... 
you wo n't go to the police if i tell you ? 
you 're insane . 
what does it look like ? 
hollis ' death . i tried to keep it from her i did n't want her upset before i could make plans for her to leave . 
she 's too upset . 
i am not ! 
she 's not tied up ! 
the police ? 
you bastard . 
it 's possible . please do n't ask me any more questions now . just wait wait for me . i 'll be back . i need you here . 
it 's possible . 
you may think you know what 's going on but you do n't . 
i want you to listen to me . my father is a very dangerous man . you do n't know how dangerous . you do n't know how crazy . 
do ? to who ? 
what did he say ?   what did he say ? 
you did n't tell me . 
you saw my fa ... father ? when ? 
he owns it . you know ? 
it has to do with my father . 
please ! ... trust me this much ...   i 'll be back . look there is something i should tell you . the fishing club that old lady mentioned the pieces off the flag . 
please do n't be angry ... believe me it 's got nothing to do with you . 
just ... i have to . 
... yes sort of a birthmark ... 
oh that ... it 's a flaw in the iris ... 
what about it ? 
what 's wrong ? 
could you do anything about it ? 
... no . why was it . 
hold still . why ? 
so why does it bother you to talk about it ... chinatown ... 
boy oh boy you 're a mess . 
the district attorney gives his men advice like that ? 
doing what ? 
what were you doing there ? 
just . i do n't know why . i 'm asking . 
when was the last time ? 
well i 'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening but if that 's how you go about your work i 'd say you 're lucky to get through a whole day . 
tell me something . does this usually happen to you mr. gittes ? 
no question from you is innocent mr. gittes . 
i gave everybody the night off . 
i 'll stay . 
they ca n't be . 
is that unusual ? 
what ? what is it ? 
and hollis knew about it ? 
no i think i 'd remember . 
jasper lamar crabb ? 
the valley ? 
what dam ? 
what are you thinking ? 
of course i 'm sure . 
for talking him into building it he never forgave my father ... they have n't spoken to this day . 
yes . he never forgave him for it . 
not exactly . well i mean yes . yes and no .   hollis felt the public should own the water but i do n't think my father felt that way .   actually it was over the van der lip . the dam that broke . 
not over me . why would they have a falling out over me ? 
no ! ... yes a little . you see hollis and my fa ... my father had a falling out ... 
yes of course . it was quite a while after . i was just out of grade school when they did that . 
i 'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to hollis and who is involved . 
whoever 's behind my husband 's death why have they gone to all this trouble ? 
what for ? there 's nothing more to say .   get my car please . 
oh no . i 've got my own car . the creamcolored packard . 
another satisfied client ? 
maybe putting your nose in other people 's business ? 
how did it happen ? 
i do n't believe you . 
you seem to have had a reason for every other question . 
you must 've had a reason to ask me that . 
yes ... why ? 
k ... cross . 
i do n't see anyone for very long mr. gittes .   it 's difficult for me . now i think you know all you need to about me . i did n't want publicity . i did n't want to go into any of this then or now . is this all ? 
i mean i ca n't tell you . 
i ca n't tell you . 
is there anything else you want to know ? 
well i would n't run home and tell him whenever i went to bed with someone if that 's what you mean . 
mr. gittes . 
i do n't like the word ' cheat . ' 
unless what ? 
i was grateful . 
my husband . 
well i suppose i am ... actually i knew about the affair . 
but he was n't killed . 
it was n't much of a lie . 
mr. gittes ...   do n't tell me how i feel . 
i have ? 
well how much would you like ? 
yes . as i said i was very grateful . 
thank you for going along with me . i just did n't want to explain anything ... i 'll send you a check . 
oh ... thank you . 
... just a minute ... 
please call first . 
no just riding bareback that 's all . anyway you might try the oak pass or stone canyon reservoirs . sometimes at lunch hollis takes walks around them . otherwise he 'll be home by 6:30 . 
no . i went riding rather early . 
it 's very personal . it could n't be more personal . is this a business or an obsession with you ? 
suppose they did . how does it concern you ? 
you may if you can mr. gittes . 
what do you mean ? 
why ? ... what on earth for ?   look hollis seems to think you 're an innocent man . 
yes mr. gittes ? 
so let 's just drop the whole thing . sugar ?   lemon ? 
i said i 'll drop it . 
mr. gittes you 've talked me into it . i 'll drop the lawsuit . 
that 's not his apartment . 
my husband 's at the office . 
iced tea . 
would you like something to drink ? 
yes that mulwray mr. gittes . and since you agree with me we 've never met you must also agree that i have n't hired you to do anything . certainly not spy on my husband . i see you like publicity mr. gittes . well you 're going to get it . 
no salvatore ... there is no future . there 's only the past . even meeting last night was nothing but a dream a beautiful dream .   we never did it when we were kids remember ?   now that it 's happened i do n't think there could have been a better ending . 
what difference does it make to find an explanation ? that 's the way it went . but alfredo did n't betray you he was the only one who really understood you . salvatore if you had chosen to be with me you 'd have never made your films . and that would have been a pity ! because they 're wonderful i 've seen them all .   but you should n't have gone and changed your name . you should have kept your own . 
he was n't crazy . in the beginning i was upset . i think i really hated him . but then with time i understood what he said ... and your silence too . 
i told him i 'd take his advice . but before i went away i left you that note ...   i was on my way down the stairs ... 
it 's the first time i 've had to chance to tell the story . i never mentioned it to anybody . 
nor have i. even though you disappeared ...   but what 's the point of talking about it ? we risk being pathetic and ridiculous .   you still live in rome ? 
politics . he 's the district representative . we met at the university in pisa . 
my husband ... you know him . 
all things considered yes . even if it was n't what i dreamt of then ... 
one or two . bur there 're not all that many salvatores .   i 've got a son too ... he 's older . and you do you have children ? 
of course i remember him . i 'm sorry . you were terribly fond of him . 
do n't be silly ... i'm old .   do n't look at me like that please .   why 'd you come back ? 
the son of one of his colleagues . do n't act that way . we 'll talk about it later . wait for me thursday at the cinema paradiso . i 'll be coming with the five o'clock bus . 
he wo n't be convinced salvatore . he has other plans for me . 
no salvatore . you 'd better go . it 's my father . 
so what 'd they say ? 
i got back today . you ca n't imagine the excuses i had to make up to be here ... 
you have a great future as a driver . if they do n't arrest you first ! ! 
for what ? 
but ... who ... 
father i have sinned ... 
yes nice day .   ... i 've got to go now . bye - bye . 
hi . why are you running ? 
elena . my name 's elena . 
please mr. bernstein . 
you do n't really think so ? 
we certainly do .   vacation 's over - starting right after dinner .   but right now - that lady over there -   - that 's the new society editor i take it ?   you think i could interrupt her a moment mr. bernstein ? 
ask them to sit down mr. bernstein . 
i promise not to bring any more venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers - 
i know . 
you 're right mr. bernstein . 
look at that . 
let 's hope they like it there . 
these 'll be kept .   i 'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly .   i will also provide them - 
i 'll write it myself . 
my declaration of principles -   do n't smile brad -   take dictation mr. bernstein - 
it 's a saying mr. bernstein .   a new broom sweeps clean . 
ready for dinner brad ? 
re - figure it mr. bernstein at two cents . 
two cents . 
get me a typewriter .   i 'll finish the notice . 
it is n't here mr. bernstein .   i 'm dictating it . 
of her acting it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low ...   have you got that mr. bernstein ? in the opinion of this reviewer - 
go on ! 
what does it say there ? 
that 's all right mr. bernstein . 
where is he ? 
i rather like it myself .   send it right away . 
that 's all right .   we have no secrets from our readers .   mr. thatcher is one of our most devoted readers mr. bernstein .   he knows what 's wrong with every issue since i 've taken charge . what 's the cable ? 
mr. bernstein mr. thatcher - 
it is accepted mr. carter with assurances of my deepest regard . 
that 'll be all today mr. carter . you 've been most understanding . good day mr. carter ! 
if the headline is big enough it makes the new big enough .   the murder of mrs. harry silverstone - 
that 's one of the things i think must be changed mr. carter .   the news goes on for twenty - four hours a day . 
i 'm going to live right here .   as long as i have to . 
you 've got a private office here have n't you ? 
mr. carter this is mr. bernstein . mr. bernstein is my general manager . 
i do n't my plans myself . 
ask them to sit down . 
are they standing for me ? 
thank you mr carter .   this is mr. leland . 
he used to work fast - did n't he mr. bernstein ? 
has he said when he 'll finish ? 
that 's leland is n't it ? 
it is n't finished ? 
is it good ? 
and the notice ? 
was the show covered by every department ? 
we 've got a nice plant here . 
of course . 
there are no objections to my staying here with her are there ? 
thank you .   i ca n't imagine how mrs. kane came to make such a silly mistake .   the sedative dr. wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -   i suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her . 
too late for what ?   too late for you and this -   this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me ?   well you wo n't do it i tell you .   you wo n't do it ! 
go on !   get out !   i can fight this thing all alone ! 
there 's only one person in the world to decide what i 'm going to do - and that 's me .   and if you think - if any of you think - 
oh yes there is . 
i suppose so but - i 'm not afraid of the story .   you ca n't tell me that the voters of this state - 
oh they 'll publish it all right . but that 's not going to stop me - 
you do n't think i 'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me do you ? 
you 're a cheap crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother - 
i insist on being told exactly what you have in mind . 
what 's this all about emily ?   i 've had a very tiring day and - 
it can wait . 
but i 'd arranged to go home with you myself . 
emily - you musn't leave me now - you ca n't do that to me . 
i 've tried to tell you emily . the president 's going to be all right .   he had a comfortable night . there 's no danger of any kind . 
they wo n't do anything to junior darling .   anonymous letter writers -    i 've got guards in front of the house and i 'm going to arrange - 
what do you expect me to do ?   what in the world - 
susan do n't go !   susan please ! 
do n't go susan . 
i wo n't let you go . 
do n't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this ? that you 've packed your bags and ordered the car and - 
no you 're not . 
i 'm not sorry . 
susan it seems to me - 
you 're talking an incredible amount of nonsense susan .   whatever i do -   i do - because i love you . 
susan i want you to stop this . and right now ! 
susan i really think - 
as far as you 're concerned susan i 've never wanted anything -   i do n't want anything now - except what you want . 
we can discuss all this some other time susan .   right now - 
you 're my wife susan and - 
i 've got more than a right as far as you 're concerned susan . 
you 're in a tent darling .   you 're not at home .   and i can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice . 
i was referring to myself .   i thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the wild west party tonight .   invite everybody to go to the everglades - 
you may be right -   i sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit - 
you always said you wanted to live in a palace . 
yes .   the bulldog 's just gone to press . 
half past eleven . 
half past eleven . 
that 's when you 've got to fight them . that 's when you 've got to make them . that 's - 
then you have no alibi at all . please sing . 
do n't tell me your toothache is bothering you again ? 
yes i would .   that 's why i asked . 
would you sing for me ? 
what happened to the singing ? you 're not in a show are you ? 
is that what you want to do ? 
that 's a ripe old age -   what do you do ? 
i did n't think you did .   if you had i would n't have asked you again because i 'd have remembered . how old ? 
how old did you say you were ? 
who am i ?   well let 's see .   charles foster kane was born in new salem colorado in eighteen six -   i run a couple of newspapers .   how about you ? 
i was only joking !   this evening i was on my way to the western manhattan warehouses - in search of my youth . 
and i know too many people .   obviously we 're both lonely .   would you like to know where i was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my sunday clothes ? 
but you like me do n't you ?   even though you do n't know who i am ? 
you really do n't know who i am ? 
you 're getting farther away all the time .   it 's a duck . 
no .   but you 're close . 
i 'll get these streets fixed if it 's the last thing i do . 
where 's the towel ? 
i ca n't stay here all night chasing your pain away . 
you 're very easily amused . 
where 's the soap ? 
i 'm sorry .   they live here too ? 
you 're no venus de milo . 
what 's funny now ? 
if these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter - 
what 's the matter with you ? 
what are you waiting here for ? why do n't you go ? 
get out both of you ! 
i know exactly what i 'm doing .   get out ! 
you ca n't blackmail me rogers you ca n't - 
rogers i do n't think i will postpone doing something about you until i 'm elected .   to start with i 'll break your neck . 
do n't you worry about me .   i 'm charles foster kane .   i 'm no cheap crooked politician trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes - 
get out !   i 've got nothing to talk to you about .   if you want to see me have the warden write me a letter . 
you do anything you want to do . the people of this state can decide which one of us to trust .   if you want to know they 've already decided . the election tuesday'll be only - 
i 'm going to be elected governor . and the first thing i 'm going to do - 
in case you do n't know emily this - this gentleman -   is - 
i 'm much obliged mr. president for your concern about me .   however i happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the united states and i say that if this lease goes through the property of the people of the united states goes into the hands of - 
it 's the only vein i know .   i tell the facts the way i see them .   and any man that knows that facts - 
i 'm not suggesting anything mr. president !   i 've come here to tell you that unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high - pressure crooks ! 
you ca n't . 
if you 're interested in what people say signor matisti i may be able to enlighten you a bit .   the newspapers for instance .   i 'm an authority on what the papers will say signor matisti because i own eight of them between here and san francisco ...   it 's all right dear . signor matisti is going to listen to reason .   are n't you maestro ? 
your job is n't to give mrs. kane your opinion of her talents . you 're supposed to train her voice . nothing more . 
you 're right .   we did lose a million dollars last year . 
on the other hand -   i am the publisher of the enquirer . as such it is my duty - i 'll let you in on a little secret it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent hard - working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money- mad pirates because god help them they have no one to look after their interests !   i 'll let you in on another little secret mr. thatcher .   i think i 'm the man to do it .   you see i have money and property - 
as charles foster kane who has eighty - two thousand six hundred and thirty - one shares of metropolitan transfer - you see i do have a rough idea of my holdings - i sympathize with you .   charles foster kane is a dangerous scoundrel his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him .   you may if you can form such a committee put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars . 
the trouble is mr. thatcher you do n't realize you 're talking to two people . 
mr. thatcher is n't everything i 've been saying in the enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true ? 
wo n't you step into my office mr. thatcher ? 
i think we 'll have to send our friend wheeler a cable mr. bernstein .   of course we 'll have to make it shorter than his because he 's working on an expense account and we 're not .   let me see -   mike ! 
can you prove it is n't ? 
i do n't know how to run a newspaper mr. thatcher .   i just try everything i can think of . 
where'm i going ? 
you goin' mom ? 
i did n't used to be afraid of it . 
he was dead ...   that 's a poem .   do you know what it means ? 
persia .   it belonged to a king . 
do you know what that is ? 
not my wife - not either of them . 
mrs. kane liked poetry - 
do you like poetry raymond ? 
lock it - and keep it locked . 
close the door raymond . 
is mrs. kane - 
all right . 
get dr. corey . 
hello brad . 
well you 've been getting a pretty low salary here in new york .   it seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our chicago paper should get what he 's worth . 
you still want to be transferred to the other paper ? 
hey brad !   i 've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let 's have another brandy . 
she can leave me .   as a matter of fact i 've already left her .   do n't worry brad - i 'll live . 
it 's simpler than that brad .   a society girl ca n't stand the gaff that 's all .   other things are important to her - social position what they 're saying on the front porches at southampton is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner - 
nothing - if she dosen't love me - 
you 're not going to like it in chicago .   they wind comes howling in from the lake .   and there 's practically no opera season at all - and the lord only knows whether they 've ever heard of lobster newburg - 
are you finished ? 
the personal note is all there is to it .   it 's all there ever is to it .   it 's all there every is to anything !   stupidity in our government complacency and self - satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you ca n't fight those things impersonally . they 're not impersonal crimes against people .   they 're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the american people to own their own country is not an academic issue brad that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers . 
why is she leaving me ? 
brad you are drunk . 
i do n't think so brad .   we 've just had word that the president is out of danger .   it seems i did n't kill him after all . 
all right . 
i 'll tell you what i 'll do brad - i 'll get drunk too - maybe that 'll help . 
why brad ? 
that 's just a little promotion scheme . nobody expects you -   mike will you try and get mr. leland some coffee ? 
i 'll get you some coffee . 
what 's wrong brad ? 
go ahead . 
i 've got to think of emily - 
i do n't have to .   i run a newspaper with half a million readers and they 're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast . i ca n't help that .   besides they all know i 'm married to his niece .   i 've got to think of her . 
oil belonging to the people of the united states was leased out for a song to a gang of high - pressure crooks -   nobody can blame me because - 
they 're true !   everything i said ! witholding that veto was treason ! 
i said treason was a capital offense punishable by death - 
what do you mean by that ? 
why not ? 
you 're wrong .   it does make a difference to you -   rector 's brad ?   come to think of it i do n't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent .   you wo n't miss anything .   it is n't much of a war . besides they tell me there is n't a decent restaurant on the whole island . 
you do n't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic ? 
i mean i 've got a job for you . 
say brad .   i 've got an idea . 
and i do it because they do it and they do it - it 's a vicious circle is n't it ?   i 'm going over to georgie 's brad - you know georgie do n't you ? 
all right brad all right - you do n't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - i 'd want to .   hello georgie . 
well gentlemen are we going to war ? 
it 's a good idea for a newspaper .   four hundred sixy thousand . 
people are going to know who 's responsible .   and they 're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly .   and no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news . 
a wasted day . 
what makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid something inflexible that people are supposed to pay two cents for - 
i think it 's beginning to dawn on mr. rogers that i mean what i say . with mr. rogers out of the way reilly i think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state .   well mr. bernstein ? 
it does seem too good to be true does n't it mr. bernstein ? 
oh yes the bonus . 
what check ? 
we 'll withdraw support completely . anything else ? 
what do you mean by that ? 
you do n't have to show me anything mr. rogers .   i believe you . 
what story mr. rogers ? 
i think i understand mr. rogers but i wonder if - 
let him finish charles . 
charles !   your - your breaking this man 's neck -   would scarcely explain this note -   serious consequences for mr. kane -   for myself and for my son .   what does this note mean miss - 
how do you do ?   i came here - and i made mr. kane come with me ...   because i recieved this note - 
if you 're asking me to sympathize with him brad you 're wasting your time .   there 's only one person i 'm sorry for as a matter of fact .   that - that shabby little girl .   i 'm really sorry for her brad . 
i know it is brad - 
brad i 'm -   i 'm not an old woman yet - 
maybe i should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was . 
there are n't any personal lives for people like us .   he made that very clear to me nine years ago - if i 'd thought of my life with charles as a personal life i 'd have left him then - 
why should anyone vote for him ? he 's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them . children - to be told one thing one day something else the next as the whim seizes him .   and they 're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars . 
i 'm surprised he got the votes he did . 
i 'm sorry i sent for you brad - i did n't - 
hello brad - 
charles if you do n't listen to reason it may be too late - 
you decided what you were going to do charles - some time ago .   you ca n't always have it your own way regardless of anything else that may have happened .   come on charles . 
i do n't think so .   are you coming charles ? 
i 'm not interested in the voters of this state right now .   i am interested in - well junior for one thing . 
charles this - this story - does n't concern only you .   i 'll be in it too wo n't i ?   and junior ? 
i do n't see what else you can do charles .   if he 's right - and the papers publish this story he has - 
oh ! ! 
i 'm going to -   - 185 west 74th street . 
i intend to find out . 
it may not be about anything at all . 
no it ca n't .   good night darling . 
there 's a call i want you to make with me charles . 
i 'm sending junior home in the car charles - with oliver - 
they wo n't hurt you darling . mother 's with you !   mother 's looking after you ! 
here i am darling ...   darling ! ... darling it 's all right ...   mother 's here . 
have they heard from father yet ? has he seen - 
please do n't talk any more charles . 
let 's not start all over again charlie .   we 've said everything that can be said . 
goodbye charlie . 
you ca n't stop me . 
- and left ?   of course they 'll hear .   i 'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but i never imagined that people would n't know . 
i 'm going to leave you . 
do n't tell me you 're sorry . 
you 'll never have another chance to hit me again .   i never knew till this minute - 
love !   you do n't love anybody !   me or anybody else !   you want to be loved - that 's all you want !   i 'm charles foster kane .   whatever you want - just name it and it 's yours ! only love me !   do n't expect me to love you - 
well i 'm not going to stop it .   i 'm going to say exactly what i think .   you 've never given me anything .   you 've tried to buy me into giving you something .   you 're -   - it 's like you were bribing me !   that 's what it 's been from the first moment i met you .   no matter how much it cost you - your time your money - that 's what you 've done with everybody you 've ever known .   tried to bribe them ! 
oh i do n't mean the things you 've given me - that do n't mean anything to you .   what 's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you 're going to keep crated up and never look at ?   it 's only money .   it does n't mean anything . you 're not really giving anything that belongs to you that you care about . 
what you want me to want you mean . what you 've decided i ought to have - what you 'd want if you were me . but you 've never given me anything that - 
i 'll discuss what 's on my mind when i want to .   you 're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it . 
i 'm not just your wife i 'm a person all by myself - or i ought to be .   i was once .   sometimes you get me to believing i never was . 
oh i 'm sick and tired of you telling me what i must and what i musn't do ! 
i 'm not going to have my guests insulted just because you think -   - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic that 's their business .   you 've got no right - 
i mean it .   oh i know i always say i mean it and then i do n't - or you get me so i do n't do what i say i 'm going to - but - 
invite everybody !   order everybody you mean and make them sleep in tents !   who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own - with their own bath where they know where everything is ? 
it 's not a habit .   i do it because i like it . 
it makes a whole lot more sense than collecting venuses . 
ca n't we go back charlie ? 
hurray for the bulldog !   half past eleven !   the shows have just let out .   people are going to night clubs and restaurants .   of course we 're different .   we live in a palace - at the end of the world . 
at night ? 
i mean in new york . 
charlie !   i said what time is it ? 
i could n't make you see how i felt charlie .   i just could n't -   i could n't go threw with singing again . you do n't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience do n't want you .   that if you have n't got what they want - a real voice - they just do n't care about you .   even when they 're polite - and they do n't laugh or get restless or - you know ... they do n't want you .   they just 0 
oh no that 's all gone . 
well i - 
oh you would n't want to hear me sing . 
as a matter of fact i do sing a little . 
oh no !   nothing like that .   mother always thought - she used to talk about grand opera for me .   imagine ! an american girl for one thing - and then my voice is n't really that kind anyway it 's just that mother - you know what mothers are like . 
i want to be a singer .   i mean i did n't .   mother did for me . 
i work at seligman 's . 
pretty old .   i 'll be twenty - two in august . 
i did n't say . 
oh me - 
i did n't run into you and i bet they 're not your sunday clothes . you 've probably got a lot of clothes . 
you 've been wonderful !   i ca n't tell you how glad i am you 're here i do n't know many people and - 
no .   that is i bet it turns out i 've heard your name a million times only you know how it is - 
excuse me mr. kane .   i know this takes a lot of nerve but - who are you ?   i mean - i 'm pretty ignorant i guess you caught on to that - 
a rooster ? 
a chicken ? 
i 've got a brush in the closet .   as soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off . 
on the chiffonier .   here . 
i know ...   but you do look so silly . 
i always like to see the funny side of things .   no sense crying when you do n't have to .   and you 're so funny .   looking at you i forget all about my toothache . 
in the water . 
no .   they 've passed on . 
hey you should be more careful . that 's my ma and pa . 
if you want to come in and wash your face -   i can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers - 
you are .   you look like you 've been making mud pies . 
you 've got some on your face . 
charlie please do n't - 
charlie you 're just excited .   you do n't realize - 
charlie he said unless you withdrew your name - 
i ca n't tell you the things he said charlie .   you have n't got any idea - 
i know .   if you 're smart you 'll talk to raymond .   that 's the butler . you can learn a lot from him .   he knows where the bodies are buried . 
do n't you think i do ?   you say you 're going down to xanadu ? 
they have n't been tough on me .   i just lost my money .   but when i compare these last ten years with the twenty i spent with him - 
in case you 've never heard of how i lost all my money - and it was plenty believe me - 
he wanted me to be comfortable - oh why should i bother ?   you do n't believe me but it 's true .   it just happens to be true .   he was really interested in my voice .   what are you smiling for ?   what do you think he built that opera house for ?   i did n't want it .   i did n't want to sing .   it was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him . 
he was in love with me .   but he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that norton woman divorced him . 
i did n't get a thing .   just the music lessons .   that 's all there was to it . 
what do you mean ? 
i did a lot of singing after that . i sang for charlie -   i sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that i did n't - 
i had a toothache . 
you would n't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and mr. charlie kane . 
how do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions ? 
get out of here !   get out !   get out ! 
why do n't you people let me alone ? i 'm minding my own business .   you mind yours . 
think again ! 
who told you you could sit down here ? 
no do n't ! 
i feel nauseous . 
you two better quit it . 
it was so cool . he did n't say a word . he was just ... ready you know ?   and we did n't kiss or talk or anything . he just sat there and let me do all the work . 
i went back there and dante was already waiting for me . 
awww . that was so cute . 
you 're very protective of him randal . you always have been . 
i 'll try to manage . 
such a sordid state of affair . 
you 're kidding . 
why are n't there any lights ? 
can i use the bathroom ? 
god is n't he great ? 
so where is he ? 
a woman 's intuition . something in me says it 's time to give the old boy a serious try . 
you might be let down . i 'm not a hermaphrodite . 
you can hold me down . 
what can i say ? he does weird things to me . 
she said not to come home until graduation . 
you 'd think she was marrying him . what are you watching ? 
you saw that article ? god is n't it awful ? my mother sent that in . 
randal graves - scourge of the video renter . 
oh god ... 
i ca n't believe this ! i feel faint ... 
i did n't just fuck myself ! jesus i 'm going to be sick ! 
this is n't fucking funny dante ! 
stop this . this is n't funny . 
we did n't just have sex in the bathroom ? 
yeah right . who was it : randal ? 
and the fact that there were n't any lights made it so ...   god ! that was so great ! 
when you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything . 
promise me it 'll always be like that . 
do you always talk weird after you violate women ? 
how 'd you get here so fast ? 
i 'm easy but i 'm not that easy .   see you later handsome . 
well me i guess .   so i shall take my leave of you but i will return in a little while at which time - yes - i would love to go for dinner and a movie with you . 
you 're too responsible . but no . i have to go home first . they do n't even know i left school . and i should break the disengagement news to my mother which is going to cause quite a row considering she loves sang . 
where 'd he go ?   i 'd have thought he 'd be at your side like an obedient lapdog . 
i can already tell this is n't going to work . 
you 're such an asshole . 
i offer you my body and you offer me semantics ? he 's just a boyfriend dante and in case you have n't gotten the drift of why i came all the way here from ohio i 'm about to become single again .   and yes - let me placate your ego - you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision for which i 'll probably be ostracized at both school and home . you ask me who i choose i choose you . 
he 's not invited . 
jerk . here i am throwing myself at you succumbing to your wily charms and you call me a slut in so many words . 
how about the caitlin bree walk on the boardwalk then get naked somewhere kind of private date ? 
the dante hicks dinner and a movie date . i think i 've been on that one before . 
you mean on a date ? 
i do n't know . maybe we should just see what happens . 
the key word here is talk dante . i think the idea the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date . 
you work in a market all right . 
it 's just the shock of seeing me after three years . believe me you 'll get over it . 
you 're serious . you want to date again . 
i 'm sure sang and - veronica?-would like that . 
good . stay in that frame of mind . 
i had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on . when i say i do n't want to get married i mean just that . i do n't want to marry anybody . not for years . 
if i 'm so nuts about you then why am i having sex with an asian design major ? 
look how full of yourself you are . 
you do n't have anything to do with it . 
why mr. hicks - whatever do you mean ? 
i just told you . 
stop it . he 's a nice guy . 
i do n't want to marry him . i do n't want to get married now . i 'm on the verge of graduation . i want to go to grad school after this . and then i want to start a career . i do n't want to be a wife first and then have to worry about when i 'm going to fit in all of the other stuff .   i 've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife . and i know that 's what i 'd become . sang 's already signed with a major firm and he 's going to be pulling a huge salary which would give me no reason to work and he 's so traditional anyway ... 
i 'm giving him his ring back . 
no i was n't . not really . i told you 'd i 'd been seeing other people . 
the last thing i needed was for you to think i was hiding something from you . 
i love a macho façade . it 's such a turn - on .   what smells like shoe polish ? 
was i right ? 
then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper . that 's when i hopped the train to come back here because i knew you 'd be a wreck . 
the story goes like this : he proposed and i told him i had to think about it and he insisted i wear the ring anyway . then my mother told the paper we were engaged . 
because i know you . you prefer drastic measures to rational ones . 
i would 've told you and you would have stopped calling like a baby . 
well ... kind of sort of ? 
i know i 'm sorry . but when we started talking ... it 's like i forgot i had a boyfriend . and then he proposed last month ... 
i was going to tell you . but then we were getting along so well i did n't want to mess it up . 
i 'm not pregnant . 
it 's not what you think . 
you saw it ? 
you 're just going to lock the store like that ? 
train . it took eight hours . 
i just saw alyssa 's little sister outside . she was with rick derris . 
dante . you 've got a customer . 
just now . 
fuck you . 
and having him tell me ... that was just the weakest move ever . you 're spineless . 
of course not ; not now ! you 're caught and now you 're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do . well i wo n't let you . i want you to follow through on this just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are . and when she dumps you again- and she will dante i promise you that - when she dumps you again i want to laugh at you right in your face just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for !   i 'm just glad randal had the balls to tell me since you could n't . 
you do n't know what you want but i 'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out ! i 've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school to take charge of your life and find direction . i even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if i was with you . everyone said it was a stupid move but i did n't care because i loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you 've been in since that whore dumped you oh so many years ago . and now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more ? 
you 're damn right it 's not like that ! because i wo n't let it be like that ! you want your slut ? fine !   the slut is yours ! 
explain what ? how you were waiting until the time was right and then you were going to dump me for her ? 
i 'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex sneaking around behind your back ! and if you think that thirty - seven dicks are a lot then just wait mister : i 'm going to put the hookers in times square to shame with all the guys i go down on now ! 
and then you pull that shit this morning freaking out because i 've gone down on a couple guys ! 
you 've been talking to her on the phone for weeks ! 
if you did n't want to go out with me anymore why did n't you just say it ? instead you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back ! 
good .   i 'll see you when you close then . enjoy the lasagne . 
eight . but i have a sorority meeting till nine so i 'll be back before you close . can we go out and get some coffee ? 
bummer well i 've got ta head back for the one - thirty class . 
you could n't get these shutters open ? 
thank you for being rational . 
the ostrich syndrome : if you do n't see it ... 
and that made you feel better ? 
what did he say ? 
you had to tell him . 
i 'm glad you 've calmed down a bit .   hi randal . 
peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off . what do you think it is ? it 's lasagne . 
lit 101 got canceled so i stopped home and brought you some lunch . 
goodbye dante . 
i 'm going to school . maybe later you 'll be a bit more rational . 
i love you . do n't feel sick . 
because going down it 's a big deal ! i used to like a guy we 'd make out and sooner or later i 'd go down on him . but i only had sex with the guys i loved . 
... and one of those guys was you ! the last one i might add which - if you 're too stupid to comprehend- means that i 've been faithful to you since we met ! all the other guys i went with before i met you so if you want to have a complex about it go ahead !   but do n't look at me like i 'm the town whore because you were plenty busy yourself before you met me ! 
yeah i went down on a few guys ... 
hey listen jerk ! until today you never even knew how many guys i 'd slept with because you never even asked . and then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls . well i never had sex with twelve different guys ! 
i 'm going to class . 
um . thirty - seven . 
lower your voice ! 
something like thirty - six . 
all right ! shut up a second and i 'll tell you ! jesus ! i did n't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked . 
let it go ... 
please calm down . 
i 'm sorry dante . i thought you understood . 
because i did only sleep with three guys ! that does n't mean i did n't just go with people . 
we went out a few times . we did n't have sex but we fooled around . 
that 's because i never had sex with him ! 
yeah . how do you think i know he liked ... 
i 'm serious ... 
sylvan ? no ; i snowballed him . 
why do you say that ? 
he gets off on it . 
after he gets a blow job he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing . it 's called snowballing . 
sylvan made it up . it 's a blow job thing . 
unlike you i have a class in forty- five minutes . 
it 's important to me dante . you have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit . i wish you 'd go back to school . 
to school . there 's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment . 
i want you to come with me on monday . 
after dropping a bombshell like that you owe me . big . 
vegetable meaning paraplegic . 
i am . and that 's why you should feel like a pig . you men make me sick . you 'll sleep with anything that says yes . 
john franson and rob stanslyk . 
i 'm not the pig you are . 
three including you . 
do you know how many different men i 've had sex with ? 
you 're a pig . 
you 've slept with twelve different girls ? 
it better be up to and including me . 
we might have ; i do n't remember . how many ? 
how many girls have you slept with ? 
how many ? 
i 'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life . 
and i actually date you ? 
oh you think so ? 
how flattering . 
you show some bedroom proficiency and you think you 're gods . what about what we do for you ? 
typically male point of view . 
i was kidding . 
ooh ! can we ? ! 
do you think anyone can see us down here ? 
honesty through paranoia . why do you smell like shoe polish ? 
how do you know they 're taking the right amount of change ? or even paying for what they take ? 
you 're trusting . 
how much money did you leave up there ? 
she called you did n't she ? 
who 's fighting ? why are you so defensive ? 
what were you doing ? 
what were you doing up so late ? 
you look bushed . what time did you get to bed ? 
you 're kidding . 
why do n't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here ? 
why did you agree to come in then ? 
do n't you have a hockey game at two ? 
i know . i stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something . 
all i 'm saying is that if you 're unhappy you should leave . 
then quit . you should be going to school anyway ... 
at least they were n't lit . 
all right stupid question . but do n't you think you 're taking this a bit too hard ? 
i 'm going to have a word with that asshole . 
after all that i 've done for that fuck ! and he wants to be with that slut ? fine ! he can have his slut ! 
no i 'm more furious . i 'm pissed off . i feel like he 's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels and then he ca n't even do it !   he has his friend do it for him ! 
i 'm not sad . 
i ... i do n't know what to say . 
and ... he told you all of this ? 
bye   that was snowball . 
i will . take it easy . 
i just talked to her on monday . we still hang out on weekends . 
no i transferred into monmouth this year . i was tired of missing him . 
no i 'm just visiting my man .   dante this is willam black .   this is dante hicks my boyfriend . 
where 's the radio ? 
if you ca n't make it back i 'll hold up at the douglas shaft . stop worryin ' .   you sound like a mother hen . 
i copy . 
and it 's such a handsome head . please frank and i swear i 'll buy one of your paintings . 
if i do n't meet up with them you can come and pick me up by nightfall . 
he said the tower but he 's on comb bluff ?   frank fly me to the west valley the winds are never too bad there and it 's only a half hour climb to the douglas shaft . 
hal 's signalling he 's ok . 
there 's a lot more where that came from .   you 're not leaving again ? 
what about you ? ! 
gabe ?   wait ' til i get over there .   tie the rope so i can come across . 
do n't lay any guilt on me . suicide 's a personal thing best done alone . 
forget it !   i refuse ! 
i 'm going to wrap it around your throat ! 
enough 's enough .   how could anybody in their right mind ... then again you never were in your right mind . 
i wo n't do it .   no way . 
are you crazy ?   has the altitude shrunk your brain gabe ? 
hand - holds ? !   i can barely see them . 
oh good . for a minute i thought you 'd lost your mind . 
what about you ? 
my heart ca n't take much more of this .   look if we climb down from here it 'll take two hours to get back to the station . 
forget it .   you 're in no shape to climb alone . i stayed with you this far and you did n't drop me so i owe you . c'm on let 's go .   hurry up time is money . 
if we go along the northern ridge we can get there first . 
i 'm holding you to that .   gabe what about frank ? 
thanks for holding on . 
do n't let me fall ! 
frank !   no frank !   frank ! 
i 've never weighed 135 lbs . ! 
this rope is sixty years old ! 
we might be able to go that way . 
they 'll kill him !   he has no idea ! 
get it ! 
no luck ? 
gabe are you alright ? 
can you see light ? 
gabe !   are you alright ? 
if we do n't get out of here soon we can ask him in person . 
want me to lead ? 
i 've gone this far and right now i think i 'm in better shape than you . 
if you 're not using your arm can i borrow it ? 
gabe ... your arm ? 
why ca n't things stay the way they are ... everything has to change .   what we had was perfect . 
no actually it was more like mutual attacking . 
can you think of something more romantic than attacked ? 
it was great . 
remember the first time we came up here ? 
you still wear the cable necklace i gave you . 
neither can i.   what do you think they 're doing now ? 
i 'm glad you find humor in this .   do you know what people would do for that ? 
what about you ? 
you know me i 'm a night person . 
excuse me ? 
for the same reason you did to help . 
i ca n't .   the radio 's at the bottom of the shaft .   but frank'll be looking for me soon . when he gets here i 'll contact everybody from the chopper . 
where 's hal what 's going on ? 
frank dropped me in the west valley and i hiked .   you look frozen .   what 's happening ? ! 
looking for hal .   oh my god i heard someone kick the door open ... you came back . 
gabe ! ? 
ca n't do it ?   i do n't believe this .   do n't you feel anything ? 
i know you do n't want to be responsible for anybody 's life anymore but walk away and you are responsible .   please gabe he went up the west ridge .   if you go up the south face you can catch him no problem-- 
you mean the nerve . 
what if he ca n't ? 
that 's not the issue here those people are .   he ca n't do it alone . 
if he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can they 'll never make it down .   he needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks . 
thank god you did n't leave .   we just got a mayday .   seven climbers stranded off comb bluff . the weather 's pouring in fast and hal 's gone up alone . 
you know where everything is ...   i 'm late for my shift . 
and i ca n't leave . 
you come back after being gone almost a year and you expect me to just leave ...   this was < u > our</u > home now it 's < u > my</u > home .   i ca n't leave .   you can stay with me and believe me i want you to but to just take off for the wrong reasons i ca n't do it .   and you should n't either . 
gabe did you come back to stay ?   you did n't . 
course maybe you do n't have to wait until i faint . 
a flare up ... 
which could maybe what ? 
i 'm not going to faint but if i want to faint i 'll faint okay ? 
did i miss something ? 
excuse me ? 
you 're saying i do n't understand ?   i 'm the < u > only</u > one who does understand .   i 'm the one you lived with for two years i 'm the one you made promises to i 'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all .   believe me there 's been times i did n't know what i wanted to do more love you or hate you .   but the one thing in our relationship that i did know and still do know is that i < u > understand you</u > . 
i do n't understand ? 
then turn it off gabe because it does n't get any better . 
i was there you were the only one who did n't panic .   so do everyone a favor do n't hog all the guilt .   you held on as long as you could .   yes everything did go wrong starting with hal . i mean what was he doing up on the tower with a girl who could barely climb ? 
why ca n't you believe that you did everything you could ? 
i know ... 
had to leave ?   believe me we all wanted to leave ... but you know what ?   we stayed . 
maybe i can help . let 's see ... if one night i got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note and stayed away for months i think what i 'd want to do is come up with a well thought - out reason . 
where 've you been ? 
hello gabriel . 
the winds are picking up . 
do n't believe it ...   you know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter . everything you think just pours right out . 
oh please . 
you can stop right there . 
he knows it well . 
oh my god !   i ca n't recognize the face but the butt does look vaguely familiar . 
gabe ?   gabe where are you ? 
wait i think i have them sighted .   what 's the word frank ? 
patience my love patience . 
then it 's a deal . 
oh my god ! 
you got ta be kidding me !   do you want me to fly up after you ? over . 
where 's the rest of the team ? 
who 's going with you ? 
got to be comb bluff . 
go after her . 
copy .   hal tell gabe he only makes advances < u > to me</u > or else he 'll be walking down four thousand feet and sleeping outside . 
you 've heard beethoven before ? 
are you referring to the background score ? 
you felt ill this afternoon because you 're getting better . you see when we 're healthy we respond to the presence of the hateful with fear and nausea . you 're becoming healthy that 's all . by this time tomorrow you 'll be healthier still . 
well of course it was horrible . violence is a very horrible thing . that 's what you 're learning now . your body is learning it . 
i imagine you 'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day . but we have to be hard on you . you have to be cured .

geronimo is down .

without a love of my own . 
you saw me standing alone ... 
jerry ... ?   < u > jerry</u > . 
i 'm sorry . 
you got to get out of here .   my cell phone 's on .   back in the truck . 
i believe you . 
how 'd you get the picture ? 
< u > why not jerry</u > ? 
why not ? 
why ?   what do these guys have to do with ezekiel walters ? 
someone else might call it stalking .   my dad felt it .   he started carrying a gun . 
back where ? 
love at first sight ? 
then tell me what happened . 
jerry .   please .   you do n't understand .   i have to know .   it 's all i think about .   do you have any idea what it 's like not to know ? 
did you kill my father ? ! 
at a horse show . 
i do n't understand . 
then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box ? 
did you kill my father ? 
did you kill him ? 
you go .   send me a postcard . 
my father 's house . 
john hinkley .   the guy who shot reagan .   he only had two names . 
what about them ? 
what 's in connecticut ? 
where are we going jerry ? 
now what ? 
we 're going to queens ? 
what is it ? 
no .   that would n't be fair .   where are we going jerry ? 
i do n't .   i know you would n't . 
answer me .   was the first time you saw me the first time i saw you ? was it ?   you 've been following me around .   do you see how that could be disconcerting to me ?   that 's not love jerry .   it 's obsession . and it is n't normal and you ca n't expect me to respond to it and you ca n't expect me to feel the same way .   can you ? 
now 's not really the time to get into this -- 
holes ?   i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
do n't do this to yourself .   jerry . you do n't love me . 
if you were eating kentucky fried chicken and drinking coca - cola again . 
jerry i -- 
i like you jerry .   a lot . 
those are song lyrics jerry . 
if that 's what you want .   yes . 
okay i will . 
a water main broke . 
they 're big details jerry . 
what was he doing down here ?   a billionaire waiting for the subway ?   why not drown him in a bus ?   why drown him at all ?   why not shoot him ?   is the hitman from the lost world of atlantis ?   i mean come on . 
where then ? 
it said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool .   < u > in newport</u > . 
sure . one of the richest men in america until he died a few days ago . 
and you think group one is at war with group two . 
cold war 's over jerry . 
elaborate on ' they ' okay ? 
realized what ? 
i 'll be fine .   let 's worry about henry finch .   p.o. box in st. louis .   he 's the last on the list . i have n't been able to reach him yet . 
they 're dead .   four out of five anyhow .   all in the last 24 hours . one car accident two heart attacks and a stroke . 
well i 've been tracking them down all morning . 
where 'd you get your subscribers ? 
what van ? 
fuck you .   i know you 're crazy but fuck you . 
you watch me do n't you ? 
not this again . 
he was murdered . 
please put it down . 
that was him . 
i 'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now . 
how is it possible ? 
it made me feel like you could see inside of me .   and i do n't know how that 's possible . 
it was that painting .   the one on the wall . 
jerry there 's something i have to ask you .   actually about a hundred things but we can make progress if you answer one question .   to my satisfaction . 
who are you jerry ? 
has this happened to you before ? 
was that who i thought it was ? 
what are you doing ? 
you have ten copies of the book but you do n't know who the main character is ? 
holden caulfield ?   < u > catcher in the</u > < u > rye</u > ? 
you 're a holden caulfield fan . 
you got a list ? 
yeah ... how many subscribers do you have ? 
' on july 8 1979 security forces under control of the trilateral commission abducted the fathers of all american nobel prize winners . the men many of them octogenarians were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles .   the sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the rand corporation in santa monica california . ' 
can you prove any of this ? 
' the space shuttle 's seismic secret ' .   ' the oliver stone - george bush connection ' .   oliver stone ? 
are these yours ? 
this would be it ? 
um coffee .   if that 's okay ? 
surprise me . 
you okay ? 
believe you about what ? 
you 're certifiable . 
what newsletter ? 
so why are they after you ? 
that 's it ? 
do they have a secret handshake ? 
what is it with you and the space program ? 
nothing scary there .   sorry . 
you have the right to ask me certain personal questions ? 
till today i have n't believed a word .   now i 'm curious .   six months eleven days .   i 'm going to give you one more hour to impress me .   where to ? 
how long have we known each other jerry ? 
see ?   was n't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans ? 
that 's how a man would do it .   i 'm not a man . 
you mean i should speed up and try and lose them ? 
as opposed to ? 
them who ? 
right .   sit up so i can see you . 
oswald was an assassin .   you 're not an assassin are you jerry ? 
that 's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out .   a lot of people are after you jerry . 
do n't tell me you 're naked back there . 
i ca n't promise you anything . 
he says a dog bit his nose . 
< u > heart attacks happen</u > . 
for what ? 
i got to get downstairs .   the c.i.a. they want to see your body . 
you expect me to believe what that someone came in here last night .   gave that guy ... something that stopped his heart ? 
people do have heart attacks . 
what is ? 
i 'll see you tomorrow . 
just relax . 
you were there jerry .   figure it out . 
put down the gun and i 'll take your statement .   okay ? 
you bit someone 's nose off ? 
johnny dancer .   you 've been in my office ten times .   how come you never asked me about that picture before ? 
you do n't have to burst in here every time jerry .   just call and make an appointment . 
i think you 're different . 
i ca n't promise you anything . 
< u > nasa</u > is going to kill the president of the united states with an earthquake . 
well i -- jerry the point .   get there .   what does it have to do with the president ? 
not for years . 
i still do n't see what it has to do with the president . 
testing some top secret seismic weapon . 
i do n't see the connection . 
it 's okay .   i 'm game . 
i do n't understand . 
you sound so sure . 
not a man .   ezekiel walters . 
it was my father 's .   kept it in his wallet .   he was murdered -- 
where 'd you get it ? 
if this was a spy novel your next words would be something like i now know too much to live .   why are you telling me all this ? 
i do n't believe you . 
i 'm still listening . 
these things you 're talking about . you did them to jerry ? 
a dog . 
jerry told me he bit your nose . 
missionary ?   penance ?   you talk about it like it was a religion . 
if i had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it i 'd arrest you right here . 
as in < u > catcher in the rye</u > ? 
ask what you can do for your country .   that kind of thing . 
it was mind control .   < u > manchurian</u > < u > candidate</u > kind of stuff right ? 
truth'll set you free .   i 'm listening . 
fine .   what the hell is going on ? 
brain washing mind control that sort of thing ? 
i did n't know the c.i.a. had psychiatrists . 
that 's it .   i went to yale .   i hope you wo n't hold that against me . 
veritas .   truth .   what is it they say about truth ? 
a year ago i was leaving work late one night .   two guys tried to mug me .   it was horrible .   jerry came out of nowhere .   to my rescue . then he started coming to see me .   could 've been a storybook if he was n't crazy .   at first i did my beat to avoid him .   but there 's something inside jerry and ...   jerry made me see it .   < u > he made me</u > < u > see him</u > .   that make sense ? 
excuse me ? 
honestly ?   i think he has a crush on me . 
i 'm sorry .   what was the question again ? 
you 've asked me that one three times . 
you already asked me that .   why do you insist on making me repeat myself ? 
and you feel bad for it ? 
excuse me ? 
can i ask you something ? 
what do i look like to you ? switzerland ? 
too bad .   because i 'm terrible at ' yes . ' 
look you 're a nice guy but i 'm not really dating right now . 
agent lowry ? 
then this is a goddamn emergency . 
do you < u > have</u > an agent lowry in your new york office ? 
i need to speak with an agent lowry . 
go to the northeast corner .   call a cab .   bring the pizza .   then there 's a poem .   roses are red violets are blue if the pope goes to washington i would too . 
-- understood . 
we do n't know who jonas is .   we do n't know who it is we 're cooperating with . 
i do n't like it .   something 's wrong . 
this does n't make sense . 
tell him i 'm on vacation .   that i wo n't be back for two weeks . 
not today ... 
i do n't think so . 
what do you suggest ? 
i 'm going to find him .   because he 'd find me . 
where do you think jerry is ? 
he 's shown himself .   why have n't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do ? 
and jonas ? 
nothing .   i was just making sure . so who are you ? 
who 's the deputy director of the f.b.i. ? 
i want to believe you too . 
do you believe me ? 
can i talk to you a second ? 
when i 'm ready to compare notes i 'll let you know . 
agent lowry . 
no .   not yet . 
i was just thinking that . 
i do n't know .   did n't see him . 
you do n't understand -- 
tell me about it . 
i do n't know .   ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology . 
is it possible ... ? 
yes sir . 
yes sir . 
thank you ? 
what would you have me say david ? 
good luck david . 
this ... seemed best . 
maybe they are .   maybe this is all part of the package .   the building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale .   maybe requiring us to come together in this way was in effect part of the plan . 
... i ca n't believe they would n't take something as basic as our biological needs into account ... 
i 'm asking for your help david .   i want to go .   they 'll need someone relatively young unattached -- and probably a scientist .   as the president 's science advisor you have enormous weight ... i 'm asking if you 'll support my candidacy . 
david ... i know we 've had our differences ... but i 've always thought of you as a fair man even when we 've disagreed -- and it 's in that light i 'm hoping you 'll consider my request ... 
it 'll just take a moment . 
do you have a minute -- ? 
you mean -- 
what is it ?   what 's happened ? 
ms. president this is communist paranoia right out of war of the worlds .   there is no reason whatsoever to believe the etis intentions are hostile .   we pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in africa . 
are you threatening me ? 
i 'm going to convert mr. science - is- the - root - of - all - evil ?   this is absurd david .   we have work to do here i do n't have time to play babysitter to the god squad . 
with me . 
what ?   why ? 
rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise . 
... could it be a nested code of some sort ? 
it 's hardly yesterday ; the signal 's been traveling for over twenty - six years .   as for why ...   i 'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there 's another message buried deeper in the signal . 
mathematics is the only truly universal language senator .   we think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention . 
goddamnit they are out there david -- 
the difference being what -- that i refuse to adopt the standard line that i do n't care about the results of my work ?   well i do care .   of course any discovery has to be verifiable of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method but i refuse to go around pretending i 'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it 's obvious to anyone with a brain i 'm just not . 
i 'm searching for patterns in the noise that 's all .   order in the chaos .   i 'm practicing listening -- 
you ca n't just pull the plug david . 
it 's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know i 'm down to three hours a week now . 
did i tell you we 've expanded the search spectrum ?   we 're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore .   i was trying to get inside their heads y'know ?   and i started thinking what other constants are there in the universe besides hydrogen and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals right ?   so we 've been trying variations of pi ... 
no doubt . 
' president 's science advisor ' -- so what you just spend all your time jetting around on air force one now ... ? 
really ?   congratulations by the way . 
oh ?   how 's he doing ? 
pepsi ?   tequila ? 
then disagree but do n't stand in my way ! 
what if you 're wrong ?   no -- i 'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you ca n't deny the possibility -- and i believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly ... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks . 
you 're -- 
dr. drumlin we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity .   there are over four hundred billion stars out there -- 
i 'm willing to take that risk . 
yes -- of course -- all i 'm saying is this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists .   if it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush or a booming voice from the sky ... 
... and while its function remains for the moment a mystery my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind . 
because you cut it from the budget three years running . 
it could be anything .   the first volume of some encyclopedia galactica ... 
how can that be ? 
maybe it 'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles . 
a third layer . 
dr. lunacharsky ... ? 
how 's the spying tonight guys ? 
i scanned it at arecibo ; negative results always . 
put it on speakers . 
i 'm not sure .   you mind checking right ascension 18 hours 34 minutes ; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes ? 
vb10 's an m dwarf ; signa draconis ... too old . 
j39 z186 ... ? 
i think we just hit the cosmic jackpot . 
it 's a civilian facility . 
okay let 's just slow down .   pull up the starfield signal origin . 
thank you mr. sensitive .   i 'm coming at this wrong ... missing something ... something ... 
it 's beautiful . 
this is how you see the sky ? 
nice .   where ? 
ellie .   pulsar ? 
dr. cullers ? 
because i ca n't . 
-- but i do n't believe it to be the truth . 
is it possible .   yes .   but -- 
by our standards ... yes . 
i do n't have the figures in front of me but yes that sounds about right . 
there is no direct evidence no . 
i do n't have an official response michael .   all i have are the same questions you have . 
... i do n't understand it .   all i can think is that maybe because the video gear was n't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design . 
that 's terrific but there 's one problem :   we do n't have the means to receive all the data on our own . 
pardon me but you ca n't do -- ! 
and a hundred mile airspace . 
-- which we 'll also need the network 's help to receive and decode ! 
you want to classify prime numbers ? 
this is n't a person to person call mr. kitz .   i do n't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for americans . 
no .   please . 
please -- if you ... downloaded ... everything about us you know the problems we face the impact it could have -- it could make the difference -- 
but you said you wanted to help -- do n't you see what it would mean ? 
but -- other people from our planet should see what i 've seen -- they should witness this for themselves . 
none taken ... but ... do we get to come back ?   others of my kind i mean . 
no !   i mean ... why so soon ? 
so .   what happens now ? 
... all those voices ... you gather them all together .   millions of intelligences in one consciousness ... and now we 're a part of it . 
the librarian ... or the library ... ? 
can you help us ? 
so we passed some kind of test ? 
the scale ... it 's just ...   so all the civilizations you detect ; they all end up coming here ? 
so who ... ? 
and they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built . 
and those other docking ports i saw ... i mean ... there are others ? 
why did you contact us ? 
can you show me ? 
so who -- what -- are you ? 
but you 're so ... i mean how could you possibly ... ?   when i was unconscious .   you ... downloaded ... my thoughts my memories even ...   this beach .   i 've never been here but i remember ... it 's how i always imagined ...   pensacola . 
so .   are you an hallucination ?   or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin ? 
you 're not real .   none of this is . 
dad ... but tell me how did ... i mean how can ... ? 
i used ... i used to dream you were alive ... and then i 'd wake up and lose you all over again . 
okay okay ... there . 
could we hear god ? 
could we hear to the moon ? 
could we hear to china ? 
but what do i say ? 
i ca n't move any smaller . 
why do n't you come back with me ? 
-- of hadden industries . 
the systems integration site . 
the gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us . 
you sound like joseph .   you think the world ends with the millennium ? 
what are you talking about ?   it 's over . 
it looks like pixie dust ...   kent would 've given anything to see this .   david too . 
what 's that ? 
it 's so ... small . 
mr. hadden i 'm a scientist ; i do n't make deals ... but .   if you wish to give me in good faith access to your information i can assure you that i will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it does n't conflict with the best interests of science ... or my better judgment . 
and in return ? 
a machine .   but a machine that does what ? 
some kind of circuitry ... ? 
you 're saying ... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it 's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is -- 
a page - break signal .   a period . 
if i knew you any better i 'd say that does n't sound like you . 
you 've ... found it .   what could i possibly have that you would want mr. hadden ? 
i did n't realize i was out . 
what kind of deal ? 
why am i here mr. hadden ? 
you live here . 
s.r. hadden ...   you compromised our security codes . 
you 're implying that the whole selection process is a sham ? 
i thought you were here because you want to go . 
i 'd say this is slightly different . 
we 've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction .   do you call it ' interventionist ' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck ? 
but the machine worked -- that 's what i 've been trying to tell everyone !   the tape -- it 's all there if they 'd just look at ...   ... the tape ... 
peter ... what is going on ?   has everyone gone completely insane ? 
how long was i gone ? 
peter what are you talking about ? what malfunction ?   what day is this ? 
wait -- hold on a minute -- 
i 'm -- i 'm fine . 
like it .   almost there . 
that you valerian ? 
someone tell me this is really happening . 
you too . 
you sonofabitch . 
i 'm serious about this peter -- 
right now -- we 'll drive down to ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us . 
and you think i do n't want those things ?   you think i do n't stay up half the night wondering if i 've made the right choice living half a world away from you wondering if any of this is worth what i 'm giving up for it everyday ?   let 's get married . 
please you 're just as ambitious as i am more -- 
but the work -- 
but what about your research -- ? 
we could be together again -- 
peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he 'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- ! 
the v.l.a. ? 
it 's almost there .   the hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time . 
if we lived at any previous time in human history we would n't even have the option of failing -- we 'd have to wonder our whole lives unable to do anything about it .   this time right now is unique in our history in any civilization 's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology .   the moment when contact becomes possible .   we 've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now . 
... we 've been going after some of the big multi - nationals but without much luck ; got a donation from a new york dowager ... we 've even been thinking about selling t - shirts . 
i 've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing .   still we 've barely started ... 
please .   any chance of that died the day david drumlin was appointed head of the n.s.f.   i have been in contact with a few other seti people ; we 've been trying to find backing from private investors . i 've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there ... 
... i keep telling myself okay that 's just the price you have to do your time doing shitwork before you 're allowed to get to the good stuff ... but if i have to catalog one more quasar ...   god i 've missed you . 
' ... is indistinguishable from magic . ' 
it 's like the pre - copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the earth or the victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made .   i mean ... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain ... i dunno a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- i mean the basic concepts did n't exist ... 
... i 'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things i care about !   or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like drumlin when if they 'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts ... 
what a coincidence .   it happens to be my fetish too . 
i read your paper on eti 's .   it 's brilliant . 
sounds like a russian general . 
ellie .   arroway . 
he 's an incredible prick but i never learned so much in my life . 
... drumlin said you 're been down at arecibo for the last year . 
something my dad -- they -- said . ' after all the suffering after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other . '   the one thing that makes it bearable is love . 
i 'm not sure ...   maybe it simply exists in the search for it .   maybe its something we have to make for ourselves . 
i do n't know .   if it was a god it was searching for a greater one .   it was still searching for meaning ... 
in other words god works in mysterious ways ... 
... but it is a good question and i suppose i 'll always wonder about the answer :   why would they send me back without proof ? 
i want to palmer -- more than anything .   but it has to be real . it has to be true . 
it 's not enough do n't you understand ?   i know it happened -- but by every standard of science by every standard i 've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point .   it may be true but it does n't matter because i ca n't prove it 's real . 
i do n't have any proof palmer . 
you 're sure you want to ?   in the universe i saw we 're not exactly the stars of the show .   what happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small . 
they do n't believe me . 
so .   i 'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites ? 
pretty ironic huh ?   i had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy ... just to find you . 
i 'm assuming you read my deposition . 
and yet that 's always how i seem to end up is n't it ?   if you really do love me palmer you 'll leave .   now .   please . 
i ca n't hear this now -- 
-- i do n't know -- 
do n't you understand ?   i just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow -- 
please palmer -- if you care for me at all do n't push this now -- 
i ca n't do this -- 
i 'm sorry -- i ca n't -- 
i 'm sorry . 
i do seem to be ... maybe because i 'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow . 
thank you . 
the final countdown . 
i remember .   you were indelicate indiscreet and entirely less than tactful ... sound like anyone you know ? 
how do you mean ? 
... another question i would ask would be a very simple one .   how did you do it ?   how did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves ? 
it 's late .   we should go back . 
it 's getting late ... 
i do n't know .   but as a scientist i have to consider that possibility . 
maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning is n't because science has obscured it ... maybe it 's just revealed it is n't there . 
did you ever stop to think that maybe that is n't science 's fault but meaning 's ? 
i thought it was well - written . heart - felt .   and a little bit naive ... but that 's just the enemy 's perspective . 
i 'm more interested in the story behind the story ... how a young man goes from living on the streets of south boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the president . 
losing faith :   the search for meaning in the age of reason . catchy . 
i read your book . 
it 's what my whole life 's been ... aimed at ; the only thing that 's given it a sense of purpose . 
if you came back .   if you survived at all .   which it 's pretty certain you would n't . 
something like that . 
if you came back . 
in other words . 
it 's too ... elegant .   the degree of economy is extraordinary ; it 's really the next logical step ... even on earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature . d.n.a. outclasses any computer we can come up with ; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable . 
i do n't think so . 
not exactly .   it has organic qualities but we do n't really understand how they 're integrated with the mechanical systems . 
i was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors . 
so .   is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this ? 
yes .   very much . 
i never knew my mother .   my father died when i was nine . 
you may not believe this ... but there 's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your god .   to believe that we 're all here for a purpose that all this ... means something .   but it 's because that part of me wants it so badly that i 'm so stubborn about making sure it is n't just self - delusion . of course i want to know god if there is one ... but it has to be real .   unless i have proof how can i be sure ? 
and there 's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it ? 
can you try ? 
that 's not doubt .   that 's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct .   i always wondered what you religious types did with your free time . 
i flinched . 
and mind yes .   what are you -- 
that 's not faith it 's physics .   the second law of thermodynamics . 
very smooth .   it 's palmer right ? where i came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards .   really though ... the bible describes a god who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old .   i look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies each with hundreds of billions of stars ... i mean burn me for a heretic but your god seems awfully small . 
well it 's been a while but i do n't recall the bible saying too much about alien civilizations . 
what about you ?   does n't all of this shake your faith at all ? 
i guess i would 've felt sorry for the universe . 
i 'd say logic more than faith .   the odds were on my side . 
champagne please . 
and where exactly does that put your position ... ? 
for managing the truth .   but the truth wo n't be managed sir .   it stops being the truth the moment you try . 
i guess i 'd say i trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of thanks for the advice but no thanks .   but to dilute or censor the truth for whatever reason -- 
you kill me you really do .   the first truly global a - political event in history and you ca n't wait to spin it . 
y'know what ?   fine .   i guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there 's no quicker way to show them . 
call it xenophobic paranoia .   do n't you see the absolute absurdity of this ?   this is n't about them it 's about us -- our violence our fear and mistrust -- 
i question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile . 
laugh it up kid . you 'll make out . 
nothin' to do with it . i ai n't never give john the kind of feelin ' i give you so i 'm payin ' him off now . do n't feel you got to say anything . way it is sometimes you just have a feelin ' for a child or you do n't and with john i just did n't . 
i 'm leavin ' the place to john . 
well why not ? idee of marryin ' got you all choked up trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin ' the hell out of all of us . 
you allus had good jobs and that girl in kentucky i taken a shine to her . 
what went wrong ? 
you think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin ' and hollerin ' and high hopes but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side . luke ? 
oh i had me some high old times . yore old man luke was n't much for stickin ' around but damn it he made me laugh . 
i ai n't askin ' what you 'll do after you get out because i 'm gon na be dead and it do n't matter . 
what are you doin' here ? 
well i do n't know i just wash my hands of it i guess i just got to love you and let go . 
we allus thought you was strong enough to carry it . was we wrong ? 
no it hain't luke . you ai n't alone . ever whar you go i 'm with you and so 's john . 
sometimes i wisht people was like dogs luke . comes a time a day like when the bitch just do n't recognize her pups no more so she do n't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain . she just do n't give a damn . they let you smoke ? 
i allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with . 
helen she sent along your things with a note and john here he wrote to the police . 
where have you < u > been</u > ?   what happened to your wallet ? 
you bastard ! 
stop acting like a silly little fag ! 
you 've got a date right < u > here</u > andy . this has got to ... 
you 're fired . 
oh god i forget .   yes .   yes .   you go .   poor thing you ought to get out . 
get out !   all of you ! 
none of you know anything about it . now go .   and andy if you persist in playing doctor leave with them . 
i ca n't andy . 
about what ? 
reminded me that i used to be attractive .   that men used to want me ... 
i want to die . 
oh god .   i must have looked horrible . 
but earlier he was staring up here .   < u > please</u > andy . 
you parked right behind him .   the one i noticed earlier .   i did n't say anything i thought he 'd leave . just take a look . 
monsieur andy disapproves of my coiffure ? 
oh god .   i 'm really crazy . 
andy ?   when a three - year - old says there 's a monster under the bed you do n't say ' forget it ' .   you look under the bad .   i 'm three years old .   call the prison . 
he whispered but it was < u > him</u > !   i know it was him ! 
i 've told you :   i ca n't afford to garage it . 
i got it myself ... i could n't wait . 
where were you ?   do n't tell me . it 's just under seventy right ?   the sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh ... 
yes .   i believed him . 
when he was seventeen . 
he told me he had done two others just like it . 
the first two murders . 
the same as the first time ... 
he took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong .   he was not acting on mad impulse .   he was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time . 
because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears .   daryll lee told me that joan of arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear . 
i thought he was lying . 
he was lying . 
the test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects . 
yes .   without question . 
in jail . 
how was conrad supposed to find kurten ? 
where did you send the message to peter kurten ? 
i think whatever is best for you daryll .   and maybe you 're right that 's the place . 
i do n't know .   i 'd like to know where he is . 
ah ha .   what did he want ? 
i will .   i 'll call you daryll and talk to you about it after i 've read it .   right now i have a question ... peter kurten . 
i 'll look for it daryll lee . 
what book ? 
hello daryll lee . 
do anything you want to me .   i give myself to you .   only put the knife down .   is n't this what you always wanted ?   i know it 's what we all want to love and to loved .   i could love you .   you could work together in some safe place learn to really understand you help you give you some peace of mind some happiness ... 
that 's not who i admire -- i admire people who are good at what they do great artists writers thinkers ... 
i have no life anymore .   i ruined your life make me pay for it . 
do it .   if that 's what all this carnage is about then do it .   have enough guts to do it . 
kill me peter do it now . 
where it began -- mccluskey auditorium . 
yes .   i do .   i want it to end now . let her go .   i 'll come -- just let her go .   she 's not important . 
you 've been perfect .   do n't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop . 
for god 's sake peter leave her out of it .   you do n't want her you want me . 
you know i ca n't do that . 
it 's daryll lee cullum is n't it ? 
where are you peter ? 
who was the man in the basement ? 
why ca n't i drive home ?   i will . you .   look at you .   < u > you</u > need a ride home .   and you do n't even know it . 
if there 's a one percent possibil- ity can you live with yourself when he kills again ? 
he has n't done bundy .   he 's done every one of the others has n't he ? if there are three dead chi omega college girls tomorrow how will you feel ?   go there .   see if there could be any way for him to escape . 
they never kill themselves .   how do you know it was him .   you never met him .   you never even saw a photograph ... 
w - we had a fight .   i called him ... called him a name ... 
i am not going to talk about it . how do you < u > know</u > it was andy if the head was gone ?   where is the head ? are you looking for it ?   oh god why him ?   because of me .   i ca n't talk about it .   i write about things like this stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries . this is the first person close to me who 's ever died .   and it 's because of me .   this monster killed him because i loved him . 
out .   where does he go ?   nowhere . what does he do ?   nothing . 
maybe you should ... 
yes .   dahmer !   and after that ... 
the university computer is down for maintenance but i 've been going through my own notes ... 
who 's the married man ? 
you 're exhausted .   let me get you a brandy . 
he felt sorry for me .   it was so nice to flirt .   he was a darling man . 
what happened to you ? ! 
you do that one i do n't want it ... 
let 's speed up the game plan ... call all the living serials to ask if they 've had contact with a peter kurten .   we could use some help on the phones ... 
' ... great dark hall of fame ... all our greatest killers ... '   his greatest < u > heroes</u > ?   he wants to be famous .   when they 're caught and people like me write about them we give them a kind of immortality . they get thousands of letters . ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month .   they 're like film stars . 
it 's not chronological : son of sam was before hillside . 
they were n't going to show it to me ? !   the arrogance !   it 's my < u > life</u > ! 
what i ca n't believe is that in an earlier life i slept with him ! christ !   any god that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button .   just give me a minute here .   the letter is addressed to me ...   you do n't feel fear do you ? you 're young .   you feel like you 'll live forever .   how wonderful . 
they put   merry < u > saks</u > on it ? ! 
look in the crowd .   he liked to hang around and watch the cops at work ... 
one of those goddamned car alarms . what 's going ... 
what 's that music .   it 's abba .   i can hear it .   it 's abba . 
why should i trust you ? 
you betrayed me !   now every psychopath in the city knows i 'm back in business ... you lied to me ! 
this one yes .   i was always curious about these twisted little souls but this is the first one i 've felt personally terrified of . he 's something new and unheard of . i do n't know what he wants . 
who 's going to catch him ?   you ?   and if you do there 'll be another one .   and one after that . 
ah if you knew that you 'd be half way to nailing him .   serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive .   this guy has a plan all thought out flexible and complex .   he 's playing a game with us .   who will he imitate next ? maybe he 's doing all the serial killers in history the great innovators the murderers ' hall of fame .   just to prove he 's better than all of them .   they got caught ; he did n't . 
it 's what bianchi and buono injected into one of their victims . 
consistency is the hobgoblin of < u > little</u > minds .   tell them to test for the chemicals found in windex . that 's a product for cleaning with ... 
is that it ? 
there were needle marks .   but no drugs in her blood . 
please thank inspector goetz for taking care of me last night . 
that little winona ryder manner ... you 're more convincing as clint eastwood . 
have you got a warrant ?   get the hell out o here !   this is the < u > only space i have left in the</u > < u > world</u > !   why ca n't you leave me out of it ? 
i turned it off .   it 's like an open window he can climb right in ... 
you 're saying it 's the same man but he 's changed his style ?   that does n't happen .   these men are robotic ; the murder is like a ritual .   the method itself is part of the pleasure ... 
then what do you need me for ? 
that 's no surprise . 
he 's going home .   he slept over because i was a little anxious ... 
because i 'm his damned pin - up girl ! his all of them !   they know me . they 're in prisons with libraries they collect clippings i 'm their worthy opponent .   you keep my name out of this . 
it 's < u > anybody</u > connected to author- ity .   they write they even knock on your door .   they 're < u > fans</u > .   it thrills them to flirt with getting caught . 
she probably let him in the door without a thought .   where are their mothers ? !   where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight ? 
maybe that 's why you ca n't catch him .   i < u > know</u > what she looks like -- the red - headed woman in my computer . 
i am not going to look at any more pictures .   they 're like a disease . they get into my head .   i ca n't get them out . 
show what ?   it 's gone .   he wrote a self destruct virus into the code so it would only play until we try to copy it .   then it erased itself . gone ...   do you remember what you saw ? 
one officer already got killed trying to protect me .   please just take it all away .   leave me alone . 
it 's too big a file to copy to a disk . 
look at the bottom of the screen . you see the icon with the arrow pointing left ?   click on that ... twice . 
if you knew why you might know where to look for him . i do n't envy you this ; he 's not done -- he 's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush .   now i 've done what you asked me . 
i sent andy out on murder missions . for god 's sake -- it 's the boston strangler alber desalvo .   he used their own stockings to strangle them .   tied in a bow - knot . 
where are the stockings he strangled them with ? 
the bodies have been carefully arranged ... different positions but somehow the same .   the positions are brutal ... yet quite ... artful .   it 's like ... a signature .   he 's proud of his accomplishments .   there are early picassos and late picassos but you always recognize the hand .   he wants us to recognize < u > his</u > hand . i 've seen this hand before ... what are you hiding ? 
he felt remorse .   he covered her . 
it was a lover or a husband . someone close .   somebody who knew her and cared about her . 
is it an ongoing case ? 
will you go .   andy make them go . 
inspector halloran that is so much bullshit you do n't like or admire me but the beautiful part is i do n't give a fuck .   that 's the upside of having a breakdown . 
oh my god no !   i 'm a clinical hysteric with panic syndrome and anxiety neurosis agoraphobic i 'm afraid of everything real and imaginary .   i never leave this apartment now .   nobody ever comes here .   i just wanted to get your attention .   i write and i used to lecture on these crimes but ... i 'm not competent . 
well let 's thank god you and inspector goetz are on the case then . 
yes i did .   poor impulse control . the accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man but you kept announcing they were unrelated .   you 'll never catch him that way . 
you do n't admire me .   no police admire me .   i got one of you killed .   why do n't you say right out what you 're here for ? 
what calls ?   i have n't made any calls . 
if he 's not out why are they here ? 
is he out ? 
i think this is number three ... 
you 're calling me a crank ? 
who is this ? 
what else ? 
they taught me at the fbi .   i was very good at it .   it scared me ... i liked it . 
he was in my apartment ! 
why do n't you shoot off the lock ? 
go and look for a note . 
is there a phone booth there ? 
listen to me .   is there a gas station nearby ? 
do n't hang up ! 
she on the passenger side ? 
it 's a woman shot in a car ? 
will you stay ?   please ?   i 'm afraid to sleep ... i do n't want ... <u > him</u> ... in my head ... 
the lock ... 
do n't let go ... i ca n't breathe ... i 'll die ! 
i 'm falling !   i 'm going to fall ! 
well .   another time then .   i 'll be all right .   he 's not going to attack me ; what i ' m rally afraid of is all in my own head ruben . 
are you always so bold ? 
you and maryjane are n't lovers . 
that would be much appreciated . thanks . 
maryjane .   you think that logic and police procedure order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night .   i did once . but you know how he 'll get caught ? he 'll have an accident or some cop will get lucky .   you ca n't catch him by being intelligent and working hard .   or the worst :   there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way month after month .   the news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows and hurry home before dark .   and then one day there are no more .   what happened ?   did he just stop ?   get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more ? did he kill himself ?   did he die in an auto accident ?   or a fight .   or get sick and die ?   it 's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth .   and you never know .   but you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back ? 
i know ' halloran . '   what 's the rest of it ? 
he 's brilliant .   this one is brilliant . 
it 's gone .   the file 's not here .   what did you do ? 
he can get into my computer any time he likes !   this is exactly the kind of thing i did n't want to have happen . 
that computer 's wired into internet . 
in the sixties .   he 's dead -- stabbed to death in prison . 
somebody is imitating his m.o . look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman ; that 's how desalvo got in the door and caught them off guard . 
i do n't want this .   what are they ? 
you were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank ? oh god i < u > am</u > !   make them some coffee .   halloran is it ?   investigator goetz ?   i had a crank call myself-- he said ...   i thought it might be daryll lee cullum .   i thought he might be out of prison . 
he wants me he does n't care about her .   let me ... 
he 's got sergeant halloran in there .   he 'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people ... 
merry how ... oh christ of course you had my phone tapped . 
tell her about < u > what</u > ? 
tell her we 're sorry we bothered her . 
we 'll get the paramedics ... 
you talked to me .   do you remember ? 
investigators halloran and goetz .   i apologize for goetz he 's a firehouse dog . 
what friday ? 
you already made the delivery ? 
you were going to make a delivery to peter kurten for daryll lee cullum .   i want kurten 's phone number . 
does n't work that way .   you had your chance now fuck yourself ... 
you do n't listen very good .   this break in -- i can call it a felony -- three strikes and you got about sixteen strikes already and you 're in jail for the rest of your life no parole .   or i could see it gets forgotten . 
shut up -- i 'm talking .   you got felony breaking and entering burglary felonious ... 
cut the crap .   you got a sheet the length of my arm ... 
inspector halloran .   homicide . you were supposed to contact a peter kurten ? 
well thanks . 
oh shut up and do n't be so damn self righteous . 
this has been the worst 48 hours of my life .   i 'm going home .   i 'm going to try to get drunk . 
helen -- let go .   you 've got to let go . 
helen .   i saw him die .   i saw him burning on the basement stairs he never reached the top . 
christ helen .   the first time we 're ahead of the son of a bitch ! i ca n't leave you like this -- and there 's no time .   knock yourself out . 
how many do you need to sleep . really sheep ? 
i 've got to go .   i 've < u > got</u > to go . 
i 'm working on it !   it 's what i do .   quinn ... halloran .   i 'll wait .   where 's andy can we get some coffee in here ? 
bundy .   that 's the last one in your speech ... 
look .   there 's the order :   you wrote it :   desalvo bianchi & buono berkowitz and dahmer .   it 's going to be dahmer next .   which means he 'll kill a man . 
what does it matter ?   this guy you checked your course records who signed up ? 
where 's the john ?   let me clean up this mess and get back to work . 
a man ?   i thought he was a boy .   this last christmas was the happiest christmas i had in the last ten years ... you know why ?   it was the first christmas in six years i was not in love .   son of a bitch < u > married men</u > !   who cares about marriage the bed just gets crowded and noisy ? ! 
i just thought it was so -- unprofessional .   of you both ! 
ruben 's dead .    so stupid a cop thing a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes ... i 'm sorry ... because you and he ... 
they get fan letters ... 
it 's also the major piece of evidence and it makes you a key part of his plan .   you ca n't run away from it anymore .   look at the order he 's doing them ... he did three as the boston strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work .   then he did one like the hillside strang- ler .   and then one as son of sam . to lead us on -- to where and what end ?   and he 's doing more than that -- he 's imitating each killer 's method as closely as he can -- in details .   injecting windex .   using .44 .   playing abba . 
i put my ass on the line giving you that . 
he said to send you his regards and to tell you that the bureau holds you in the highest esteem . 
ruben 's gone to look ... it 's banged up but it looks like a .44 .   it 's son of sam .   is it son of sam ? 
what 's that siren ? 
helen hang up let ruben get on with his work ... 
because i 'm all you 've got . 
i did not ; the mouth -- that 's what we call susan schiffer -- got it on her own . 
i 'm giving you clint outside . 
you 're afraid of him . 
he 'll get caught .   if he has a plan that 'll be what trips him up ... 
injected windex !   why would he switch to a new m.o . ? 
i know windex for god 's sake i clean my own windows ... 
that 's not consistent ... you said they never changed their style they 're robots ... 
that 's exactly ... i could have taken that same picture this morning . 
so far nothing they test for comes up positive . 
hello ruben ...   so that 's that ... 
clint is putting a guard on you . but if you swear to leave the computer on winona will assign him to the hall outside . 
helen -- the killer directly contacted you .   his interest in you is < u > intense</u > .   i 'm worried about you . i do n't want to lose you .   i know this stirs up every monster under the bed but this is the only direct contact we have with him . the only chance we have to trap him .   so you can turn internet back on or i do and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick scream and hyperventilate . 
he comes in the window we maybe grab him .   where 's the on - switch ? 
who turned off the internet computer ... 
but it 's a different m.o . 
we 've got another one . 
i want a guard on you .   i 'm worried about leaving you alone . 
that 's amazing .   a whole new book thought up in a minute .   very good .   all i know how t do is get up take a shower and go to work . hope if he does another i 'll nail the son of bitch and they 'll spell my name right in the newspaper . where is andy going ? 
nobody knows you have anything to do with this case ; nothing has been on tv or the news ... why would he want to get in < u > your</u > computer ? 
look at the sign .   ' hell ' ?   in the festival of love ?   you make any sense in that ? 
i just came from her ... here 's what you have n't seen . 
i do n't look at pictures .   i look at the < u > real thing</u > .   i do n't feel infected . 
we 'll show that to ... 
< u > he</u > wo n't . 
i 'm going to put a guard on your door . 
can you make a copy we can show on our computers ? 
how do you know that ? 
work with me . 
why imitate a dead serial killer ? 
how did you know they were stockings ? 
how do you know that ? 
for months ... last october . 
you ca n't go out lecturing ?   tough shit .   women are dying .   where can i lay this stuff out ? 
well it 's a hell of an apartment you got here .   i 'm living one step away from the projects myself but i get to go to work every day wading in blood and guts .   i guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good . 
i think you are .   i really admire everything you 've done ; it would be an honor to work with you and we need all the help we can get especially yours . 
would you want to work with us on this ? 
sugar and cream for goetz ; i take mine black .   you 're absolutely correct .   the politicians do n't want panic headlines spoiling the festival of love . 
< u > you</u > called < u > us</u > doctor hudson . 
i want to tell you it 's a great honor to meet you and talk to you . 
because of your phone calls . 
ring the gong he goes .   poor impulse control . 
that 's an opinion not evidence ... 
do you have any evidence to report ma'am ?   do you know any of the victims ... 
no ma'am .   this is no joke .   and neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help . 
inspector halloran homicide .   i 'm in charge here . 
how come you 're so up on dr. hudson ? 
she takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes . 
sir doctor hudson and i see a pattern develop ... 
someone broke into her place last night .   it was n't connected to our case but it shook her up pretty bad so i have n't ... 
over here . 
who came in after you ? 
whatever it is i 'm gon na find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later . 
you touch anything mike ?   pick up anything ?   use the doorknob ?   i do n't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me . 
i 'm over here ?   what 's your name officer ? 
just horseshit luck . 
you 're in terrible trouble nikko . 
quinn will be here any minute .   what are you going to say ? 
if this is just the dump site where did he do the job ?   where did he pick her up ? 
god you 're cute when you 're mad . 
do n't put yourself down like that . i < u > never</u > used you .   i worked my way up like a marine grunt ! 
well you outranked < u > me</u > nikko . 
you got that right nikko it 's none of your business . 
oh i know . 
maybe it 's something you did in this life nikko ... 
because it 's your job that 's all . 
i 'll talk to conrad myself .   i 'll be in the jail when you wind this up ... 
do n't try to lie ruben .   you do n't have the face for it .   i need you to help interrogate the burglar in hudson 's place ... 
helen ... excuse me we ... 
bunch of swedish women .   you 're too young . 
the woman 's unstable .   you could wind up with a harassment charge . < u > anything</u > .   you 're like some horny little teenager . 
you damn well better start working on that impulse control .   a woman who is implicated in this case ? someone who 's practically a piece of < u > evidence</u > ? 
now listen up ruben .   you never never never mess with somebody < u > inside</u > the case ! 
get the pictures and casts of footprints . 
yeah everything 's different . 
ruben my god i ought to put you on report . 
look at her legs . 
what about her arms ? 
quinn decided we should form a task force -- they 're all one case now . he wants all the senior detectives on it ...   she was n't killed here . 
my promise . 
why would he send this to helen hudson ... 
let 's get out of here ... 
tell it to your shrink . 
honest to god ruben ! 
he 's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine .   we heard from doctor hudson ? 
order chinese for us and meet me the library ?   anything but beef . 
sure .   she likes < u > you</u > rube .   she likes the way you move .   she sure as hell is n't in love with me . 
snotty neurotic bitch ... 
get mercer to run the medical dental legal bills laundry and dry cleaning receipts extermin- ators mailmen grocery and drugstore deliveries handymen plumbers ... 
you 're good enough you 'll never have to kill anyone .   i joined the cops to save lives not waste them . 
answer it . 
my third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that . 
she 's in no shape to give her statement tonight ... 
that was bundy .   he killed forty of them identical long hair parted in the middle alike as barbie dolls .   ... this is hopeless .   let 's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and tv hookups and broadcast a warning ? 
you want mine too ?   you take his you take mine .   i 'm the one fucked it up ... 
give me ruben back ... 
or the f.b.i. ? 
i 'm gon na drop charges on the break - and - enter at hudson 's ... 
the prowler in hudson 's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect ... 
i got ta have ruben and a ... 
give him < u > that</u > pompous son of a bitch . 
if this is a first step in kicking me off the case just tell me to my face sir do n't waste time being diplomatic . 
what does this mean ?   now we got the fbi my team is expendable ? i 'm working my ass off is anybody listening ?   why ruben anyway ?   he and nikko do n't even get on together ... 
because i think i 'm wrong . 
helen hudson ... 
i 'm sorry it had to come to your attention .   i am dealing with it . 
you 're damn right i do . 
it 's not the same guy .   it should be a self - solver .   no bow around the neck left and body outdoors completely different .   the others were housewives secretaries he talked his way inside killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom .   this one did n't have a husband or a boyfriend no family temp waitress 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses dui asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head .   sexually assaulted .   the others were n't molested that way .   we 're waiting for the sperm tests ... 
we could use a little help . 
oh maaaaan ? ! 
so .   do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information ? 
i 'm checking out anybody who lives like desalvo .   records of arrests for rape especially by a man wearing green .   checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile .   cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses public fondling .   if they 've got a german wife .   we can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years and this guy 's going to hit again soon . 
do n't swear at me because we got problems .   i 'm just giving you the news .   i went to a catholic school ; i 'll tell you what they teach .   on the knuckles they teach . 
yessir .   i have reflected on that sir .   which explains my gushing deference to you sir . 
that 's always your privilege sir . 
anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case ?   she 's the expert .   i need help . 
what clues ?   i 'm going to work helen hudson . 
the same as the firs two . definitely a serial . 
am i in charge of this thing ?   or not . 
you messed with the scene . 
we 're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement ... 
detective niccoletti ? 
you messed with the evidence . 
i just got here .   talk to you later ... 
i just got here myself susan . 
i 'd like to go back . james ... 
one of my suitors . 
i was n't driving . i 'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport . could it have been deliberate ? 
my last lesson 's next week .   james ... my car ... 
i 'd better come with you then . are you sure you can drive ? 
you 'd better drive him . he 's a bit shaky . i 'll follow in my car . where is yours ? 
they 're questioning vaughan about an accident near the airport . some pedestrian ... they think he was run over intentionally . 
is he circumcised ? can you imagine what his anus is like ? describe it to me . would you like to sodomize him ? would you like to put your penis right into his anus thrust it up his anus ? tell me describe it to me . tell me what you would do . how would you kiss him in that car ? describe how you 'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans then take out his penis . would you kiss it or suck it right away ? which hand would you hold it in ? have you ever sucked a penis ? do you know what semen tastes like ? have you ever tasted semen ? some semen is saltier than others . vaughan 's semen must be very salty ... 
have you seen his penis ? 
would you like to tuck him though ? in that car ? 
do you find him attractive ? 
he must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his . it 's like a bed on wheels . it must smell of semen ... 
maybe i am a little .   james i 've got to leave for the office . are you going to be all right ? 
i 'm amazed that she 'll let you drive her . 
i 've never really noticed . is renata going with you ? 
how can you drive ? james ... your legs . you can barely walk . 
renata tells me you 're going to rent a car . 
no i could n't . i feel too close to her . 
i wish i had . they bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months . 
minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel . the instrument panel was buckled inwards cracking the clock and the speedometer dials . the cabin was deformed and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside . the carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids . 
it is ? 
the sergeant asked me to identify it . he did n't believe you 'd gotten out alive . 
my car not yours . yours is a complete wreck . the police dragged it to the pound behind the station . 
outside in the visitors car park . 
he was a chemical engineer with a food company . 
the other man the dead man his wife is a doctor - dr. helen remington . she 's here somewhere . as a patient of course . maybe you 'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk . 
well yes .   you 're getting out of bed tomorrow . they want you to walk . 
yes . from wendel . to celebrate the license approval for our air - charter firm . i forgot to tell you . 
if i groundloop during my flying lesson on saturday you might wake up and find me next to you . 
not a lot of action here . 
there that 's better . 
poor darling .   what can i do about karen ? how can i arrange to have her seduce me ? she desperately needs a conquest . 
no . what about your camera girl ? did she come ? 
in the private aircraft hangar . anybody could have walked in . 
yes .   they felt like traffic accidents . 
yes . i did n't plan it that way . 
the junior pathologist at ashford hospital . then the husband of a colleague of mine then a trainee radiologist then the service manager at my garage . 
i do n't know . you can never be sure with vaughan . this is his show . 
when i first met vaughan he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems . i do n't know what he is now . 
that 's vaughan . he talked to you at the hospital . 
that 's the point . besides i know i can give something now that i was n't remotely aware of before . it 's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment . 
we sat in b massive traffic jam under an off - ramp . i do n't think we moved more than fifty yards .   i 'm thinking of taking up a new job with the road research laboratory . they need a medical officer . the salary is larger something i 've got to think about now . there 's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic i 'm beginning to feel . well it 's a new approach for me in any case . 
it 's much worse now . you noticed that did you ? the day i left the hospital i had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason i did n't understand . there seemed to be ten times as much traffic . 
do you want a cigarette ? i started to smoke at the hospital . it 's rather stupid of me . 
i work in the immigration department there . 
i 'll wear a bloody kimono if i want to . 
not yet - though not soon enough for some people i 've already found . a death in the doctor 's family makes the patients doubly uneasy . 
have n't i ? to the airport if you could . 
were you badly hurt ? i think we saw each other at the hospital .   i do n't want the car . in fact i was appalled to find that i have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped . 
they said it was here . they told me this morning . 
after this sort of thing how do people manage to look at a car let alone drive one ?   i 'm trying to find charles 's car . 
i have a going - away gesture for you too . 
ok good . that 's good . thanks an awful lot for everything and for coming down here to see me off . 
are you saying i 'm through with therapy ? 
i thought about calling but i want to wait until i know when i 'll be out . 
but what i really ca n't believe is that i 'm starting to actually miss work . 
first you tell me to do what i want to then you tell me to stop . 
i do n't want to hear anymore . 
look i know he 's almost through with treatment here . and he 's on medication . 
i do n't need a lecture .    i care about michael . 
i know michael 's a schizophrenic and mrs. hallstrom 's manic- depressive and john lockyer has episodes of psychosis and i heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur . 
i 'm a grown woman dr. emlee .    i can take care of myself . 
i could n't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule . 
i miss beast a lot too . 
the medicine 's still bothering me . it feels like i have cotton wrapped around my brain . 
do we have to talk about this ? 
i do n't think you understand .     i wo n't wait . 
i want to see my mother immediately . 
what kind of place is this ? 
psychologist therapist whatever . 
yeah and a dimple . 
well i do n't have hallucinations . honest . 
i did this already . 
i was so sure . i really thought it would work .   we have plans ruth . 
i ca n't .     i ca n't see him there . 
but what am i going to do ? 
oh ruthie what am i going to do ? 
i ruined your wedding night . 
i do n't think people even noticed . i thought the ceremony was perfect . 
i did n't say ... 
do we have to talk wedding details ? 
you 're slowing . 
that settles it . i 'm never leaving . 
i ca n't believe you finally gave me the shirt . 
i 'll be back before you can say souffle . 
no no . they 've got to be puglia olives packed in a light brine with a flavor that does n't overpower the palate . 
sage rosemary ...   les herbes . 
fuck me . 
paul can you hand me the olives ? ruth i need you to what was it ? 
do you think i should ? 
hi mom . 
you look beautiful . 
everything 's ready for tomorrow night -- except the artillery . 
yeah everything 's under control . 
things have been kind of stressful lately . 
i 'd have to see it on . 
she said she 'd be here at 10 . 
yeah it 'll be fun . 
you know what ruthie ? i better get back to my class ok ? 
maybe though . maybe it would work . i could throw you an engagement party maybe . 
mom and dad ? at dinner together ? are you crazy ? 
oh wait a minute now i see where you 're going . 
i 'll talk to her and to dad too .   a few wisely - chosen guilt tactics and they 'll be ours . 
mom wo n't miss your wedding . she 'll come around . i promise she will . 
well my theory is that people can really enjoy math but they lose interest ... 
just go ahead and tell us . 
what 's up with you ? 
just remember that i love him . 
i 'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded . 
he 's been looking everywhere for weeks mom .    it 's not that easy after you 've been locked away . 
michael just got a job .     could n't you congratulate him ? 
a deal 's a deal . 
mom we agreed . you can visit but you 're not allowed to mention michael . 
i 've already made arrangements . 
it 's good exercise mom . 
and if i want to smoke i 'll fucking smoke . 
mom look if i want to dump paul i 'll dump him . if i want to screw michael or live with him or marry him then i 'll do that . 
mom please . 
i have n't had a crush since i was 
we are n't allowed to wear jewelry in here mom . 
oh ok well better to choose the table cloths first anyway . 
which flowers did you order ? 
you too mom . 
and my class . it 'll be hard to find a good substitute . and what about my math program ? 
but what about beast ?    who 'll ... ? 
maybe i should talk about this with ruth or paul . 
i just want to go home .    can we go home now ? 
i 'm so glad to see you . you ca n't believe the people in here . they 've got patients posing as doctors ... 
mom i was there and i just i was so ... they did n't have the olives and i i got so upset . i do n't know how it happened . 
i 'm sorry . i 'm so sorry . 
can i get you a glass of champagne ? 
mom please . 
oh no . 
no not yet . but you know paul . he 's sure to get it . 
you 've only known jake a few months . 
wow .    congratulations . 
come on . 
not now but maybe later if they like the program . 
i 'll be running it three days a week and ... 
you 've been so great . i just feel a lot clearer about things . 
i guess so . i think that 's right . 
i do n't mean to go on and on like this . 
to talk ?   well ok that might be good . 
mottled really .    green and red . 
it had this red spot on its back . 
it 's got a green dot on its back . i ca n't go to sleep with it watching me . 
there 's a spider in my room . 
i 'm really not that hungry . 
i guess i should go now . 
just promise me you 'll be ok ok ? 
do n't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier ? 
maybe we could just run away to tahiti and live on the beach . 
i love you so much . 
i know i do n't want to lose you .      i do n't think i could stand it . 
what are we going to do ? 
oh god michael i know .   why does everything have to be so hard ? 
i 'm sorry .      i did n't come here to blame you . 
well then why 'd it happen ? 
someone has to take care of you right now michael . you tore up the apartment . you stopped taking your medications . 
i 've been thinking i could try to visit you at night after work and then there 'd be more time on weekends to see ... 
and all the plans we have . 
it 's hard to know where to start . 
i guess we need to talk . 
michael calm down . please . it 's ok . 
i think i should call someone . 
michael take it easy . 
i did n't talk to her about medications michael . do n't be silly . 
what do you mean not taking your meds ? 
we both talked to her michael . and your dad . 
what is it ? are you ok ? 
bye uncle cort .   what 's with the lie ? 
when he could get time off from the restaurant business . 
you do n't have to know all this by saturday . it took me years . 
no that 's aunt connie . lily is the one who looks like a hooker . 
i got worried . are you ok ? 
you 're going to miss the top ten . 
i think you know i 'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap . 
that 's ok . we can call and reschedule in the morning . 
the restaurant too ? 
are you ok ? 
you go ahead and relax . i 'll cook . 
you got wine . that 's great . 
who ever said sanity was fun ? 
yeah .     how was the job search ? 
i bombed . it 's either work in the office or nothing . 
that 's mr. beast to you . 
good luck . 
i 'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour . 
not yet . 
did i get spaghetti sauce on my face ? 
it 's sex time . 
you 're so wrong . 
how can you not like the top 10 list ? 
what do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate ? 
i love your apartment . 
let 's try out the bed . 
it 's tv heaven . 
very trendy . let 's see the rest . 
i love the pillows .

just checking . 
and did you go to the mission ? 
so there were no problems ? 
tell me all . 
great . i came to tell you to break a leg and to give you this for good luck . 
john and nurse gates are waiting for you . 
but i do .      i love you too . 
michael i ... 
do you ? 
your family just met me . 
lie down . 
i do n't like lamb . 
i have a terrible confession . 
and we 'd eat spaghetti - o 's in bed from the can . 
what else would you do ? 
no way . 
i just want to see beast .   where would you go ? 
break up ?     they wish . 
i 'm starting to think that everyone 's crazy to some extent . 
sure . but i took out a whole grocery store . 
what are the delusions like ? 
schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions . 
wow .     i 'm bad news . 
really ?     me too . 
thanks .     where 've you been all day ? 
the lady knows this is a dandelion . 
do n't be ridiculous . 
we 'll get caught . 
we 're supposed to be asleep . 
and i 'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call dominos . 
i wo n't do your portion of kitchen cleanup . 
good god . 
really this is n't funny . 
the left one . 
enough with the abracadabra . 
what have you done with the ring ? 
it was romantic .    he 's very romantic . 
he asked me to marry him . 
finally . i was getting tired of watching him try every night . 
i was n't hungry . 
but you 're checking it out . 
anything interesting . 
i 'm not the one who 's masquerading as a doctor . i 'm not the one who 's who 's ... 
you have no right no right to take the worst thing that 's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game . 
who do you think you are ? 
you took bets on my diagnosis ? 
a while i guess . 
is this really important ? because i do n't think it 's a problem . 
by color . 
sometimes my food and my clothes and my underwear . 
chair cup and ball . 
no 79 . sorry this makes me nervous . 
i answered these questions last night . 
sure i understand . 
i 'm really sorry . 
our relationship meant a lot to me too paul . but it 's over .   and michael being in the hospital does n't really change things . 
michael .    yes . 
getting back . 
i start on monday . 
i 'm just glad there are n't any hard feelings . 
here 's the ring . 
i love him . 
he 's a patient here . 
it does n't matter who . 
i 've met someone else . 
i do n't mean to hurt you .     i know this is a terrible thing .     and i have really loved you . 
i need to tell you something and i 'm not sure how . 
of course . yes . i will .      i do . 
no no . 
no you 've done a perfect job . 
it 's it 's really nice paul . 
or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients . 
you do n't have to say anything else . i 've known for a while that this was coming . 
i know . we ca n't just keep going through the motions . 
especially now . 
yes i suppose so . 
of course not no .   is that why you 're here ? 
something you did ? 
that 's a big question . 
yeah i guess it 's all right . 
i 'm going to the store . 
can you loan me a 20 ? 
you know what i think we need ? martinis . how about martinis to celebrate ? 
i do n't think so . 
no i ca n't . i 've already convinced both mom and dad to come . 
it 's just i 've got those parent conferences and i 'm supposed to set up the math program by next week . and shopping for ruth 's dress and that that engagement dinner . 
no it 's not like that . 
i 'm sorry .   i 'm just ... i'm so tired lately . 
paul i just ca n't go . is that ok with you or am i committing some horrible crime ? 
i do n't feel like going to work today . 
i 'm calling in sick . 
sure . of course . 
oh ok .    maybe . 
i mean tonight . 
my math program . the superintendent said he 'd fund it . 
believe me i know your feelings on the matter . 
in there 's better .   it 's kind of romantic do n't you think ? 
it 's not another one . it 's my sister .   are n't you happy for her ? 
office work ? 
what does that mean ? 
i 've already thought about how to tell the kids where i was . 
believe me i wish i 'd understood what was going on . i 've worked really hard to get better . 
look gail i 've been a good teacher . 
well i understand .      i know my behavior was poor . 
i do apologize .     a student had a crisis . 
i know .     i know . 
do you want to go see him ? i 'll take you if you want to go . 
you do n't have to make any decisions tonight . 
you did the right thing . 
that 's thanks to all your help . 
what 's his name letty ? 
oh no of course not . 
and then the gold scroll or the black romanesque print ? 
what do you think ? 
mom and i fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white . 
i can hardly wait ' til you 're free . planning the wedding without you has been a disaster . 
loaned you . and it 's only ' til you get out of here . 
letty dinner 's almost ready .    the souffle ... 
it 'll be fine . 
what 's all the dreck ? 
what 's the matter ? 
what about the souffle ?     has that gone in ? 
how can i help ? 
go on letty . i want to see it on you . 
look mom i think i 've found the dress . 
what about this one ? 
thanks so much for planning it letty . jake 's really looking forward to it . 
what about the engagement party ? 
but everything 's ok ? 
what do you think of this one ? 
where 's the old bag i sometimes call mommy ? 
and the party ? 
please letty . 
you always throw the best dinner parties letty . 
maybe if we had them both to dinner or something . 
she says she wo n't even come if dad brings monica . 
no really . tell me about the promotion . 
there 's nothing to tell . 
me ? nothing . tell me more about the job . 
do n't be fresh . 
i will dear . i promise .   why mcdonald 's ? 
honestly letty . 
not even if it 's something positive ? 
i 'm so thankful you 'll be leaving next week . if you want me to pick you up i will . 
must you walk so quickly ? 
i 'm only looking out for you . 
do n't forget that paul 's a promising young attorney who loves you very much ... 
i hear this michael fellow is schizophrenic . 
when did you start smoking ? 
just think pretty soon we 'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you .   of course if that 's what you still want . ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here . 
i was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask . 
we have n't . i wanted to talk that over with you too . 
you 're looking good .     a little thin but good . 
it 's so good to see you sweetheart . 
as soon as dr. emlee says . 
i 'll see you soon . 
paul said he 'd call the school .   and your father thinks he 's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help . 
ruth 's already taken him home . 
we all agree with the doctor dear . he thinks it 's safer for you to stay here for a while . 
everyone says it 's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing . 
i 've talked to doctor emlee and he says ... 
oh letty what happened ? 
i 'm here sweetheart . i 'm here . it 's going to be ok . 
i gather he 's late as usual . 
especially with a promotion in the offing . 
paul could pop the question at any time . 
has paul heard about his promotion ? 
tell us every detail . 
my goodness . a wedding .       my goodness . 
are you sure dear ? 
will you get time off to do that ? 
how wonderful darling .   what does that mean for you ? 
then we just have to make sure everyone who knows ca n't say anything . 
i thought you wanted zammito ? 
they 're supposed to be evidence .     that 's why bastaldi set this up . 
listen we know their names . they do n't know the city . you 'll find them . you 're the fbi . 
zero .    that 's all i know . 
black market art . zammito got to a few key security guards at the metropolitan museum . the bastaldi 's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works . they 'd switch the paintings send the originals to paris and the bastaldi 's would sell them to private collectors . 
laurant and vincent were in business with zammito . 
i do n't know . 
i know they wo n't be home tonight . 
no .     145 ridgeroad way . 
no i did n't . 
you can use my car . 
there 's an exterior alarm system . there 's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector . the control panel is in the bedroom . 
they do n't have a wine list . 
vincent bastaldi is in jail . 
stick around and find out . 
after last night i could say the same for you . 
sounds boring . 
what are you doing ? 
i 'm sorry things went so wrong today . 
ca n't sleep ? 
the lucky ones . 
i 've been thinking about getting tattoo . you know a flower or something . on my ass . 
sorry .    i did n't mean to pry . 
you got it in a bar ? 
that 's how you get to know someone .        did it hurt when you got it ? 
it looks old .      did you get it a long time ago ? 
did she break your heart ? 
casandra . old girlfriend ? 
they 're not nice people . 
the art world does n't fully appreciate my talent yet . i needed some way to pay the rent . laurant and vincent pay well for information . 
so how did you get hooked up with these guys ? 
it belongs to vincent bastaldi . he left it last time he was here . i 'm sure he would n't mind if you used it . 
you like shoes ? 
take a nap . 
i was n't expecting this many of you . i 've got a few sleeping bags you can use . 
i did n't have the heart . 
li mu bai is coming to stay the night . 
how 's the arm ?   still sore ? 
take my horse and go to the compound . give this to mrs. wu .   she 'll help you .   hurry ! 
you ca n't die !   tell us what poison you used !   you ca n't die !   tell us the antidote !   you ca n't let li mu bai die ! 
without the green destiny you are nothing . 
do n't touch it !   that 's li mu bai 's sword . 
how dare you accuse us ?   i always knew you had stolen the sword ! i 've done nothing but protect you and your family .   and you 're repaid me with nothing but contempt .   li mu bai himself spared you and all you do is insult him .   we wanted some peace and you 've ruined it all ! you 're no sister of mine ! 
li mu bai has made arrangements . he sent him to wudan mountain . 
he really loves you .   come back to peking with me .   we 'll find a solution . 
go back to them first .   then you can decide about lo . 
look at the trouble you 've caused . now you know what giang hu life is really like .   if you think of me as your sister let me give you some sisterly advice .   you can run from marriage but not your parents . 
i 'll give them to you . 
here you must be in proper attire . 
yes from the west .   he went undercover and and followed her here 
then as a sister let me wish you happiness in your marriage . 
i am not an aristocrat as you are ... but i must still respect a woman 's duties . 
his name was meng si zhao .   he was a brother to li mu bai by oath . one day while in battle he was killed by the sword of li mu bai 's enemy .   after li mu bai and i went through a lot together .   our feelings for each other grew stronger .   but how could we dishonor meng 's memory ?   so the freedom you talk about i too desire it .   but i have never tasted it . 
yes .   did you know i was once engaged to be married ? 
do you think so ?   let me tell you a story . 
you are fornuate to marry into such a noble family . 
thank you for seeing me .   i hear your wedding day is near .   you must be overwhelmed by the preparations . 
you write gracefully .   calligraphy is so similar to fencing . 
you 're doing calligraphy ? 
how so ? 
you 're probably right . 
what do you think ? 
so i heard .   congratulations .   it 's the most important step in a woman 's life is n't it ? 
sure .   no place to bathe for days sleeping in flea - infested beds ... they tell you all about that in those books ? 
writers would n't sell many books if they told how it really is . 
fighters have rules too : friendship trust integrity ... without rules we would n't survive for long . 
yes i am .   but i prefer the machete .   certain moves however call for a sword . 
you 're too young to understand . 
my friend li mu bai .   he 's given it to sir te as a gift . 
beautiful but dangerous .   once you see it tainted with blood its beauty is hard to admire .   it 's 400 years old . 
the handle is heavy .   and the blade is no ordinary metal .   still the sword is the lightest of weapons . you 're just not used to handling it . 
use it to meditate .   free yourself from this world as you have been taught .   let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath .   do not waste it ... for me . 
save your strength . 
mu bai hold on .   give me some hope ... 
that ca n't be !   everything has an antithesis !   why not this ? 
we followed jade fox . 
what happened ? 
not a bad idea .   tonight we 'll get a good night 's sleep at headquarters . 
what about you ? 
to repress one 's feelings only makes them stronger . 
not everything is an illusion .   my hand ... was n't that real ? 
do n't you want to see her again . 
you think jade fox will show up ? 
i wish there were something more i could do to help you . 
it 's not our affair .   even if wudan accepts her her husband might object . 
but wudan does not accept women . 
she 's an aristocrat 's daughter . she 's not one of us .   in any case it will all be over soon .   you 'll kill fox and she 'll marry . 
i knew she would intrigue you . 
my job was to get the sword back without embarassing anyone .   i was n't about to ruin her life or her father 's . 
but it 's not your sword anymore . you gave it to sir te . 
then why did you come ? 
what do you mean ?   did n't you come back here for it ? 
no i 'd already sent them home . you can blame me for losing the sword but please trust that i 'll get it back soon using my own methods . 
no not yet ... 
it was bo sir te 's man .   i hear he followed the thief to the yus ' . 
be careful .   sir te requires discretion .   official business is difficult enough .   do n't let personal feelings make it worse . and i do n't know ... even this poster ... could be some sort of trap . 
is there any place safer than under the nose of governor yu ? 
you always suspected she 'd fled to the west . 
but something is going on at the yu household . 
join me once you have finished .   i can wait for you in peking . 
come with me to peking .   you can give the sword to sir te yourself . it 'll be just like old times . 
so what will you do now ? 
you use it justly you 're worthy of it . 
i do n't understand .   how can you part with it ?   it has always been with you . 
the green destiny sword ?   you 're giving it to sir te ? 
we 're preparing a convoy for a delivery to peking . 
what was it ? 
you were enlightened ? 
why ?   you 're a wudan fighter . training is everything . 
the mountain must be so peaceful ... i envy you .   my work keeps me so busy i hardly get any rest . 
monk zheng said you were at wudan mountain .   he said you were practicing deep meditation . 
good .   and how are you ? 
mu bai ... it 's been too long . 
i doubt it .   this thief ... it very unusual ... 
yes .   the very killer of li mu bai 's own master .   last night she killed a policeman who had tracked her down . 
no mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in peking . 
sir te knows that even well - meaning people can make mistakes ... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families . 
we know who stole the missing item . if the thief returns it i 'm sure sir te will pursue the matter no further . 
i 'm sorry she 's not feeling well enough to receive you today . 
the best way to trap a fox is through her cubs . 
sir te can you find some excuse to invite madam yu and her daughter ? 
we must be careful .   governor yu is a court official and in charge of security .   any disturbance will cast suspicion on him .   it might get sir te in trouble . 
but the sword could be in his compound . 
has governor yu ever seen the sword ? 
i beg your pardon .   li mu bai and i are n't cowards . 
i do n't know ... 
please sir te what is it ? 
you 've always been so good to li mu bai and me .   please accept our thanks . 
sir te !   it has brought him as much trouble as glory .   help him to leave these troubles behind . otherwise he 'll never be able to start anew . 
master ... i started learning from you in secret when i was 10 .   you enchanted me with the world of giang hu .   but once i realized i could surpass you i became so frightened !   everything fell apart . i had no one to guide me no one to learn from . 
you would n't have understood even if i had tried to explain .   you know ... you 've gone as far as you can go .   i hid my skills so as not to hurt you . 
you think you 've been teaching me all these years from the manual ? you could n't even decipher the symbols ! 
i owe you nothing . 
shut up ! 
that was just for fun .   how can i leave ?   where would i go ? 
i 'll never live as a thief ! 
why are you still here ?   you killed a policeman .   you should leave ! you 'll bring ruin on my whole family . 
he is my defeated foe ! 
so what if i do n't ? 
do n't bother . 
i have a guest . 
it will be just the same .   enough ! i 'm tired . 
i 'm tired now . 
i 'll socialize with whomever i please . 
do you know her ? 
put them down . 
please sit . 
spare your energy .   i 'll be back ! 
she used purple yin ... purple yin poison .   it goes straight to the heart . 
do n't be a sore loser .   go ahead . take your pick .   i 'll wait .   go ahead . 
come and get it if you can . 
what do i care ?   you were never a real friend anyway .   but i wonder how long could you last as my enemy ? 
you 're working together to set me up !   i 'm leaving ! 
where is he now ? 
you know about lo ? 
they forced me to marry ! 
you sister ... 
i was just passing by and wondered how you were . 
i 'm just borrowing some clean clothes .   i 'm not staying . 
you say she killed a policeman ? 
do n't distance us .   from now on let 's be like sisters . 
too bad for meng but it 's not your fault or li mu bai 's . 
no really ? 
about you and li mu bai ? 
am i ?   i wish i were like the heroes in the books i read .   like you and li mu bai .   i guess i 'm happy to be marrying .   but to be free to live my own life to choose whom i love ... that is true happiness . 
i 'm hardly doing a thing .   the less i think of it the better .   my parents are arranging everything . the gous are a very powerful family . my marrying one will be good for my father 's career . 
maybe it is .   i would n't know . 
i 'll write your name .   just for fun . 
i 'm bored . 
i 've missed you . 
no !   you could n't roam around freely if you were . 
you 're not married are you ? 
you know what i mean .   i 'm getting married soon but i have n't lived the life i want . 
but you 're just like the characters in the stories . 
i 've read all about people like you . roaming wild beating up anyone who gets in your way ! 
it must be exciting to be a fighter to be totally free ! 
you 're a sword fighter too ? 
li mu bai !   the famous warrior ? why would he give his sword to sir te ? 
exquisite !   you said it belongs to ... 
but i have had much practice .   as a child in the west a platoon lived with us .   they 'd let me play with their weapons .   the scabbard is so beautiful . 
it 's heavy for such a thin piece of metal ! 
the antidote exists .   she taught it to me .   the formula is simple but it takes time to prepare .   trust me . as you have helped me let me help you . 
give it back ! 
all right .   if you can take back the sword in three moves i 'll go with you . 
what do you want ? 
only the sword will settle this . 
not another lecture !   on guard ! 
make a wish lo . 
do you remember the legend of the young man ? 
do n't ever come back . 
if you do n't i 'll come after you . and i wo n't let you off so easy . 
keep it safe .   return it to me when we are together again . 
do n't send me back ! 
let them look . 
so you 're still that little boy looking for shooting stars . 
and so the little boy became a fearsome bandit .   he could n't find the stars so he stole my comb . 
give it back . 
give me back my comb . 
by the way i 'm a real manchurian . 
it 's mine .   it means a lot to me . a barbarian like you would n't understand . 
you coward ! 
my comb ! 
give it back ! 
you should n't have come . 
i know . 
actually i was planning on running down to kinkos . do you think you could give me ride ? 
his journal . he sent it to me the day before he died . everything about you is in it . the blow jobs the hand jobs the menages your bout with bulimia the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you ... eww . let 's see then there 's your coke problem ... you still keep it in your crucifix do n't you ? it 's all in there . 
i have his journal . 
kathryn i know all about you and sebastian . 
you heard me . 
oh cut the shit kathryn . 
thank you . 
i 'll be fine . 
that 's right . 
you might say that . 
i do n't think so . 
annette harrison . 
you promise not to say anything ? 
i ca n't tell you . i 'm sworn to secrecy . 
i do n't know . i 've been hearing some awful things about him . 
what do you mean ? 
no . i mean . i do n't know .   what else do you know about him ? 
really ? i thought he said it all the time . 
but you knew this was important to me . 
you do n't know how to love . 
why are you trying to hurt me ? 
i love you . 
what are you saying ? 
yeah me neither . 
would you like a tour ? 
i 'm fine . i have to get going to my friends ' house .   was it -- 
please do n't go . 
how am i a hypocrite ? 
sebastian please . i do n't want us to end on bad terms . 
i think that 's for the best . 
where are you going ? 
it 's because i do n't trust myself with you .   i took a vow and because of you i 'm tempted to break it . do n't destroy that for me . please . 
you really want to know ? 
that 's not fair . 
i have feelings for you . 
i thought you said we were going to be friends . 
why are you doing this ? 
bonjour monsieur philipe . 
who 's monsieur philipe ? 
not at all . have a seat . 
oh dear are you actually laughing ? 
lighten up . 
it 's not about winning . you know what your problem is ? you take yourself way too seriously . 
no it does n't . i 'm happy you 're being honest with me . 
that 's okay . it does n't make you a bad person . 
you 're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady . 
you must take me for a real idiot . 
oh please . 
you ? volunteer ? i do n't think so . 
i 'm doing some volunteer work . 
sure . have a good night . 
you 're not gon na start that again . 
somerset maugham . 
what are you reading ? 
what are you doing ? 
wait do n't hang up . 
it was n't a date . he 's just a friend . 
i 'm ... i 'm alright . 
no not at all . 
it 's not about being happy . you and i ca n't - 
if that 's a problem then i 'll make arrangements to stay with some friends . 
alright .   i want you to leave and go back to new york . 
and you promise to abide by it ? 
you truly want to do something to make me happy ? 
that 's also none of your business . 
i 'm busy . 
that 's none of your business . 
i ca n't . i 'm seeing a friend . 
yes but only when it 's mutual . and this is far from mutual . 
you do n't even know me . 
i 'm sorry but i 'm not here to be your savior . 
and that 's a bad thing ? 
i thought we agreed that we were going to be friends . 
it was fine . 
i 'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you ca n't intimidate me . 
give it up . 
no thank you . 
that 's repulsive . 
you 're naked . 
i 'm sorry but you 're not my type . 
i do n't ... i do n't want to answer that ... look we 're friends . 
because you act like a pig . 
look i 'm flattered but seriously it could never work . 
shut up . 
thank you . 
look i did n't mean to give you a hard time . 
i never said that . 
about what ? 
how 's the water ? 
the last thing i need is you going into my room searching for this while i 'm away . 
i sincerely doubt it . 
this is my favorite part .   even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating . he has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention . every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it . 
you know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible . 
give me a minute . i 'll be right down . 
gee with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse . 
at this hour ? i do n't think so . 
you need help . 
romantic ? he rapes her . 
you 've read the fountainhead ? 
the fountainhead . 
look i know this is your house and all but do you think you couid keep it down ? i 'm trying to read . 
excuse me . excuse me ! 
alright i said i was sorry .   can we start over again ? i think we 've gotten off on the wrong foot . 
why are you being so dramatic ? 
it 's not really important . 
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to upset you ... but you still did n't answer the question . 
a friend wrote me . 
take yourself . you 've slept with several women . are you happier because of it ? 
i was n't knocking anything . it 's just my belief that people should n't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions . 
that 's a first . most people praised me for it . 
you did ? 
are you often this offensive on a first encounter ? 
i do n't know . relationships seem too distracting . i 'd rather concentrate on my studies . 
ben schwarz . 
my grandpa used to breed horses on his farm so i would come over and ride all the time . 
my mother and i used to ride a lot before she got sick . 
it 's a beautiful home you have here mrs. rosemond . 
you ca n't do this to me . it could ruin me . 
you did n't show it to anybody ? 
you what ? 
sebastian was a pathological liar . i would n't believe a word he - 
who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me . my brother is dead have some respect . 
excuse me ? 
look i know this sounds corny but whenever i feel like i ca n't go on i ...   turn to jesus and he helps me through the problem . call me an anachronism but - 
well i 'll leave you alone now . i just came in here to get something of mine . 
are you okay ? 
i 'm sure you 're going to love it there . 
now i remember . annette harrison . your father 's the new headmaster at oakwood . 
did you know sebastian well ? 
have we met ? 
i 'm kathryn . 
that 's one way of looking at it . 
cecile everybody does it . it 's just that nobody talks about it . 
so ? do n't you want to make ronald a happy pappy ? practice makes perfect cecile . my advice is to sleep with as many people as possible . 
now listen . now that you 're on your way it would be stupid of you to stop . think of sebastian as a tutor . let him instruct you . 
i 'm so proud of you . you 're becoming a woman . 
cecile you had an orgasm . 
well did you like it ? 
cecile i think you 're going to have a hard time crying rape if that 's all he did . 
well what then ? 
he made you give him a blow job . 
so let me get this straight . you came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you . 
why did n't you do something ? 
does your mother know ? 
cecile you have to tell me . 
what do you mean ? ! 
calm down . tell me what 's wrong . 
it 's kathryn . 
of course i would . we 're friends right ? 
cecile if there 's one thing i 'm great at it 's love letters . with my help he 'll be eating out of the palm of your hand . perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house . 
i want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me . 
did you hide the letters ? 
listen to me . your mother must never know . never . 
cecile we just made out in the middle of central park . you can trust me . 
well do you like him ? 
that 's so romantic . have you responded ? 
oh come on cecile . he 's crazy about you . 
maybe you should try it on your friend ronald sometime . 
eyes closed . 
let 's try it again only this time i 'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth . when i do that i want you to massage my tongue with yours . that 's what first base is . 
see that was n't so bad . 
do you want to learn or not ? 
it 's not gross . how else do you think girls learn ? here turn around and face me . 
have n't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends ? 
what are you scared of ? 
that 's great . 
really ? bulimic headcase . 
so rumor has it that you went on a date with court reynolds . i hear he 's very nice . 
i 'll call you later and we 'll get together and plan your curriculum . 
i was thanking her . vietnamese is such a beautiful language . 
will you stay here for the night ? you can leave in the morning . that 's when my parents get back and -- 
i 'd be careful if i were you . god knows what he 's up to . 
it 's been going on for a while .   then he called me a disgrace to our family and that 's when he hit me . 
how have you dumped girls in the past ? 
why so nervous ? 
then do me a favor and get rid of her . if not for me then do it for you . look at yourself . you 're a joke . she 's turned you into jelly . what do you want to be one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling . people used to respect you . they feared you and now you 're going to throw that all away . 
is that what you think ? 
not anymore you do n't . it 's obvious . 
at first it was but now it 's become something bigger . 
i 'm sorry . it 's just upsetting . you 're in love with her . you do n't love me anymore . 
p - whipped p - whipped . 
oh my god . you 're completely p - whipped . 
i want to fuck . 
and that 's why you 're leaving ? 
excuse me ? 
wow . so you made love . ooo i hear the birds chirping . 
no tell me . 
oh come on . for her first time ? 
tell me all the details . 
you did n't ? 
kind of . 
she would n't say . she apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends .   you blew it sebastian . that girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again . 
you do n't know ?   she left thirty minutes ago . 
if you 're heading towards her room you wo n't find her . 
you 're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you did n't . god are you a chump . 
so what went wrong ? 
she shot you down . 
well i know how it went with cecile . she wo n't shut up about it . how 'd it go with mrs. jesus ? 
so ? how 'd it go last night ? 
do you mind if i take my new porsche for a ride ? 
and that 's why you 're losing your bet ? 
she 's really getting to you is n't she ? 
what 's your problem ? 
jesus she reeks of laura ashley .   oh she 's crying . wittle baby 's upset by the big bad book . 
that her ? 
who are you spying on ? 
i just had a nice chat with cecile . i do n't think she 'll be giving you anymore problems . 
what is that ? oh my god it 's your conscience . 
i 'm aware . 
well let me know when you do . until then . 
have you succeeded in your task ? 
i hate when things do n't go my way . it makes me so horny . 
thank you . mmmm that feels good . 
i rat cecile out to mommy . mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship . boo hoo . 
not to mention court reynolds . unfortunately ronald 's moving with the speed of a special olympic bobsledder . 
the plot thickens . it appears that cecile has fallen for her music teacher . 
what 's wrong with you ? 
call me later . 
fuck her yet ? 
it would feel so yummy . 
you can put it anywhere . 
because i 'm the only person you ca n't control and it kills you . 
in english .   i 'll fuck your brains out . 
i 'll give you something you 've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married . 
if you lose then that hot little porsche of yours is mine . 
oh gee your journal . could you be more queer ? 
i 'll think about it ... 
you do n't stand a chance . even this is out of your league . 
b.f.d. what do you plan to do ? fly to kansas and woo little dorothy . 
jesus christ is she for real ? 
i 'm not interested in the latest dating tips from jonathan taylor thomas . 
oh but diddling the therapist 's daughter is a challenge ? 
why not ? 
she 's quite cute you know . young supple breasts a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie . 
i need you to seduce our young cecile . introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery . 
because if there 's an attack made on court it could be traced back to me . i ca n't allow that to happen . everybody loves me and i intend to keep it that way . 
keep your friends close and your enemies closer . when i get through with her she 'll be the premier blow job queen of the tri - state area and poor little court 's heart will be shattered . 
i do n't find this very funny 
in any event my feelings were hurt when i learned that he had fallen for someone else . someone chaste ... pure ... innocent . 
oh poor baby . well you can relax . i have a mission for you . 
hopefully though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid . 
i 'm just taking the poor girl under my wing . 
cecile 's attending oakwood in the fall . 
oh please . i ca n't have you do that . 
you will be discreet about this ? 
i know . she 's so young and he 's so - 
it 's worse . i think there 's something going on between cecile and her music teacher . 
well ... you promise you wo n't say anything to her . we 've developed a friendship and ... 
it 's cecile . 
i hope i did n't keep you from something . 
do n't worry it 's totally understandable . most of the boys that matriculate at oakwood are very upstanding gentleman however there are the occasional bad apples . 
i know this sounds corny but whenever i feel temptations of peer pressure i ...   turn to god and he helps me through the problem . call me an anachronism but it works . 
you 're too kind . 
i 'll do my best . 
i 'll see you tomorrow . 
doctor king is my favorite . 
ronald is one of the few high school students attending juliard . he 's composing his first opera . 
oh i suck . i suck . 
i 'm in the bath mom . 
those are my letters ! 
where did you find those ? 
what are the boys like ? 
it 's like a secret society . 
but that would make me a slut .   would n't it ? 
i do n't love him . i love ronald . 
i am ? 
i did ? 
well ... i do n't know - it was weird . at first it felt icky then it felt kind of okay . then i started getting really hot and then i started shaking and then like i do n't t know ... it felt like an explosion but a good one . 
what do i do then ? 
if that 's what you call it . 
well ... not exactly . 
i do n't know . 
if she knew she 'd kill me . it happened at your house last night . 
it involves your brother . he ... took advantage of me . 
i ... i do n't think you want to know . 
something awful happened last night . 
who is it ? 
best friends . 
you 'd do that for me ? 
yes . they 're in this antique doll house in my room . 
i do like him . i ca n't stop thinking about him . 
i do n't know . 
is it that obvious ? 
what are you saying ? 
that was cool . 
it was nothing . 
i guess . it still sounds gross . 
are you for real ? 
eww . no . that 's gross . 
ah duh . boys . i 've never even gone to first base with a guy . what do i do ? 
you think so ? i do n't know . i guess i 'm just scared . 
what a loser she must be .   anyhow court 's invited me to the hamptons for labor day weekend . 
he 's alright .   he kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over fourth of july . 
thanks .   nice meeting you . 
what was that ? 
want a blow job ? 
need any company ? 
where are you going ? 
is it me ? 
i 'm sorry . 
i like it better when i 'm on top . 
am i suppose to be this sore ? 
want to join me ? 
what are you doing ? 
just a kiss right ? 
and then i can go home ? 
please please please . i 'll do anything . just do n't call my mom . 
my mom ? do n't call my mom . 
i want to go home . 
i want to go home . 
i look terrible . 
what are you doing ? 
you think he 'll like it ? 
but i thought high school is only four years . 
what year are you in ? 
my father just took me on a trip to australia . 
would you please leave . 
good luck sebastian . 
do n't even think about it . rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman who happens to be attending princeton this fall . she 's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s . 
my daughter rachel . 
i hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase . it 's going to get you into trouble . 
no it does n't . i see right through you . 
you think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me . it does n't work sebastian . 
this is n't a joke . your parents spend a lot of money to send you here . i 'm trying to help you . 
no . this is going to be our last session . 
i think that 's all the time we have for today . 
do n't you want to change that ? 
but you said you have the worst reputation . 
and you have n't made an ounce of progress . 
jesus . we 've been at this for six months . 
jesus christ how can you be so stupid ? 
alright honey just calm down take a deep breath and step out of the circle . 
who told you ? 
honey is something wrong ? 
i can see it all ... the very day it began . amy was lonely ; she was desperate for friendship . i remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring . that must have been the day she first wished for a friend . 
forgive me but it was superstition ... foolish childish wishes ... that started all this . 
it 's been ages since i 've even thought of a mummers ' play . when i was in college we used to do them every year  st. george and the dragon all kinds of sword dances . 
i love the smell of pine . 
no . i only let her go with edward .   it 's alright . 
yes   she 's a little odd i understand . 
yes . as a matter of fact i was on the point of telling you about it yesterday  about oliver 's first marriage  and his wife 's death . it has so much to do with amy  although he 'll never realize it . 
we do n't even like them   i 've often thought of giving it away but oliver would n't stand for it .   it was his first wife 's favorite picture .   she was an artist . 
but it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past it 's a goya reproduction . those three cats --   are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in western art . 
oliver 's pet   i 'm sure it would be the first thing he 'd grab if we ever had a fire . 
oh hello . 
i 'm so glad to have met you at last . you 're just as nice as amy told me you were .   i hope you 'll come to see us . 
that 's exactly what i told mr. reed but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you miss callahan . 
all right amy .   go tell edward to take you . 
would n't it be just the same darling if daddy dropped the present at mrs. farren 's on his way to town tomorrow morning ? 
oh thank you darling . 
look ! why do n't you run out and play ? the sun 's shining . 
she was very pretty . 
where 'd you get this darling ? 
edward will give you your breakfast amy . 
sh ! then you must keep it true . goodnight darling . 
you must n't tell anybody or it wo n't come true . 
well  the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you . you ask edward to go with you . 
i really do n't know but i do know that you must return the ring . you get edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady . 
no dear . i do n't know them but i 've heard about them . 
the farren house 
someone gave it to you ? where was this old house ? 
but where did you get it amy ? 
where did you get this ring ? 
oh lots of times . 
yes darling . 
oh you 'll remember it some time . 
what song dear ? 
i suppose any note no matter how sour is a song if you hold on to it long enough . 
what are saying darling ? 
but edward in this kind of a wish that does n't matter . 
you get your wish ! 
oliver please . let 's not go on with this . the child 's trembling . 
what 's funny ? 
some day i 'm afraid we 're going to have to tell her about irena . 
amy picked it off the top of that stack . perhaps you 'd better go through the whole bunch . there may be others of irena in there . 
well you know where it is . 
it 's your play . 
i thought amy was calling . i guess not . 
you 're shouting at me . 
you mean you did n't . it seems to me the least you could do . you ca n't just jump at conclusions that way . you 're being unfair . 
did you hear the child out ? 
my my what a coil we 're in ! what 's this all about ? 
but they must have .   amy and i made them out together .   you mailed them did n't you edward ? 
what do you mean ? 
that 's right . 
all right ollie .   go ahead . call the boyds ... 3000w ... see if their darling donald has left . 
oilie that 's for the children to play with . 
times have changed . 
it 's early yet . 
i forgot i had it on . 
darling no father could be nicer to a child than you are to amy . 
i know dear .   i understand . but try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking .   and especially today  let 's forget about it . we want a really bang - up birthday party do n't we ? 
that 's why i can tell you straight out you think too much about irena -- blame yourself for her death .   and its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about amy . 
i 'm not a jealous woman oliver . 
she 's not irena 's child -- there 's nothing of irena in her . she 's my child . 
i wonder if you do n't resent that in her ? 
you do that edward . 
but i told her to go with you . 
that 's the farren house . 
i thought you were with amy . 
but it wo n't be christmas tomorrow . 
mommy could edward take me to mrs. farren 's house to give her her present ? 
you ca n't open it yet . you have to put all of them under the tree until morning . 
all right mommy . 
what 's her name ? 
it was right there on top . is n't she pretty ? 
i had my breakfast while you were still asleep . 
but it 's already come true . 
i got my wish anyway . 
are they nice ? 
do you know the people ? 
on the back street  a green house 
at the old house with the voice . 
that 's what i wished on . edward says it 's a wishing ring -- and it is ! 
i made a wish today and it came true just like edward said it would . 
did your wishes ever come true ? 
did you ever make a wish ? 
the song i was trying to hum . the song my friend taught me . 
i was n't saying anything . i was singing . 
i can make wishes like this come true .   i 'll be just like daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself  tell the truth -- 
you know what i wished daddy ? i wished i could be a good girl . 
i got lots of presents . 
i live right here . 
are you coming to see us . miss callahan ? 
mommy 's having a party for me . i asked robert and donald and lois -- 
it 's late mommy -- you have n't forgotten my birthday party . 
tell me tha real truth . you can see my friend ca n't you ? 
she 's upstairs .. .the lady who lives up there . 
yes she was afraid . she said there was someone who wanted to kill me . 
but irena is in the garden . she 's right there under the tree . 
do n't you see her? ... right there under the tree . 
she 's there just like i said she 'd be . 
she 's there whenever i call her ! 
it is n't a secret . she plays with me . she plays with me in the garden all the time . right out there in the garden she does ! 
because she is my friend . 
why daddy you know my friend too ! 
she gave me a ring so i 'm giving her a ring . i paid twenty - five cents for it too . 
just you wait ! 
these are all from me . 
you 're upset about me -- i made you fight --i hate for you to fight . 
no i did n't . 
daddy it 's true . 
it was just a voice . 
it 's true . 
i did .   i came to an old dark house and a voice called to me -- a lovely sweet voice --- 
they ran away . 
it was on account of the birthday party . 
but i did n't play with them daddy .   they would n't play with me . 
i wanted to talk to you   i wanted to tell you about the other children . 
but you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree could n't come true . 
but wishes do n't come true . 
i did n't forget . 
yes daddy . 
i 'll show you . 
yes i did . 
yes daddy . 
is that my birthday cake ? may i see ? 
well i guess we 're not a very proper family . 
i do n't know yet . 
but why ? 
oh it is it is ! death 's terrible . 
but she 's dead ! 
she 's dead ! i know what it is now when people say somebody died . i know what they mean ! and i 'm afraid . she 's dead ; she 's dead ! 
it 's you ... irena ... my friend ! 
i want to touch it . 
may i pet the deer ? 
i can sea its breath in the cold . 
it stands so still . 
so beautiful irena . so beautiful . 
merry christmas . 
oh please ! 
oh that is more beautiful than i ever imagined it !   i wish i could show you to mommy and daddy .   i wish you could enjoy christmas with us . 
it reminded me of you so i bought it . it cost me more than all the others . 
you can open it now i guess . lois huggins says that 's proper 
merry christmas irena .   i brought you a present . 
yes winter 's coming .   i do n't like the winter 
my dolls . we can pretend . 
no i do n't think that 's very much fun . let 's play house instead .   you be the friend who comes to see me .   i 'll show you my children . 
but we do n't have any sea weed . 
that one 's an elm . 
this is more fun than just pretend . 
yes yes ! i see prince 
a princess ? 
the numbers simply do n't mean anything 
i 'll just never learn arithmetic . 
you 'll always play with me ? 
oh i like the sound of that .. amy and her friend ... amy and her friend . 
not even daddy ... or mommy ? 
i shall want you for always . 
will you be friend for always ? 
but where is that ? 
but where do you come from ? 
i 've wanted a friend . 
irena . but who are you ? 
who are you ? 
but where has it gone ?   where 's all the strength and the quickness ? 
but it was alive  it was fast and strong ! 
why is it just lying there ? why does n't it get up ? 
but what happened to the little deer ? 
but i saw what it was . it 's the little deer . 
there was a deer on the other side of the fence . 
but she 's such a nice lady . 
but mrs. farren just started to tell me a story . please . 
that means i can go alone ? 
you 're going to be busy all day long edward . 
will you come soon ? 
but i want to talk to you . mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me . i 've got to take back this ring . 
i was n't singing to myself . 
i 'm trying to . 
well if it 's a real mourning ring . i 'm going to think hard for something i want more than anything else in the world before i wish . 
the ring up to him ) what 's a mourning ring ? 
a ring that i can wish on like i wished on the candles ? 
it 's a pretty ring . 
a lady threw it to me . 
look at my ring . 
mommy 's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away . 
hurry hurry . 
hide me ? why ? 
and does he kill people ? 
who 's herne the huntsman ? 
i brought you a present . merry christmas . 
he 'll let me stay mrs. farren . he 'll let me stay . 
why has n't he got a head ? 
mommy read it to ne . 
i like stories . 
no thank you . 
who is she ? 
but i only came to give back the ring . 
but my mother says i must n't accept gifts from strangers . 
if you were the lady who gave me a ring my mother says i have to give it back to you . 
death 's like life . death 's a part of life . it is n't frightening . it is n't the end of everything . it is n't quiet and nothingness . it 's a part of all eternity . 
yes amy . 
but amy !   amy ... i'm dead . 
amy listen to me . death is n't such a terrible thing . 
you must n't be afraid . 
do n't cry amy . 
it is wildness and freedom . no one can touch it . 
it 's a warm breath -- warm and strong  warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer 's back in the hot summer ; sweet with leaves and mosses . 
because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind . 
you wanted to share this moment with me . 
a merry christmas to you amy . 
you and i shall enjoy christmas together . shall i show you my christmas gift to you ? 
i shall wear it in my hair ! 
oh how beautiful ! 
oh thank you amy . 
oh but the winter 's fun . there 's the wind and the snow . you 'll like the warm fire upon the hearth and the long long nights . 
all right amy .   button your sweater darling . it 's turning cold . 
your children ? 
pretend darling .   it 's all soul 's eve .   round about the fire we go ...   over the flames we leapt 
light shining ) in her eyes ) throw sea weeds into the flames and the fire turns blue ! 
there 's an oak leaf .   add a maple . 
that 's right ! 
of course . and two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee . 
oh yes they do .   look .   one is like a tall princess . 
but you must ! 
ca n't you get it darling ? 
whenever you want . 
no . this must be a friendship that only we shall have ... you and i ... amy and her friend . 
for always then . only you must promise never to tell anyone about me 
for as long as you 'll let me . 
i can not tell you . 
you would n't understand . i come from great darkness and deep peace 
i 've wanted a friend too . i 've been lonely . 
i 'm your friend . 
you called me by my name . 
i ca n't do it ! i ca n't do it ! 
yes yes - 
my little girl said she 'd kill you if you came to see me . i ca n't let you die . we 'll have to hide you . 
no not people -- just deer and game but the people he catches can never be free again . they too must kill and kill covering themselves with blood . 
do n't you read shakespeare ? 
do n't you hear it ? 
a christmas present . it 's been so long since i 've had a christmas present . 
it was shot off long ago in the great battles that were fought here ; with the british on one side and the americans on the other . 
the headless horseman -- 
then i 'll tell you a story  a lovely story . do you know the story of rapunzel ? 
one little piece of cake wo n't hurt you . go ahead take one . it 's full of fruit ... citron cherries and ginger . it 'll make you dream . yes wonderful dreams . 
there you are . take some cake why do n't you ? 
that woman is an imposter a liar and a cheat . how do you like your tea ? < /pre><pre >                                 amy well ... .sometimes i got a spoonful of tea in a cup of hot milk . 
she 's always spying on me . she creeps into the room . she lives upstairs yet she 's always watching me  always ! 
the ring ? we 'll have no more nonsense about the ring . 
stranger ? julia farren a stranger . why i 've played every theatre from boston to san francisco . i 've been to london and paris . those days  those beautiful shilling golden days . 
return it to me ? indeed you may not . i gave it to you as a present . 
i 've been watching you . you could n't see me but i could see you . it was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began . you would be a very good audience . i can see that . 
good night ... barbara ... 
i 'll not see her barbara . i promise . 
i - shan't see her . no barbara no . 
yes . yes barbara i sha n't forget . 
yes barbara ... barbara ... 
it was pale ... a shadowed gold . 
yes ... yes that 's true . 
gray . they were a lovely lovely gray . 
anybody could know that song . 
my barbara was killed . i killed her . yes it was my fault . everyone told me not to drive from the theatre . there was a raging wind that night and snow and ice . all was well until we got to the sleepy hollow bridge . barbara was singing a little song and then ... i do n't know how it happened .. when i awakened they told me the car was overturned and they would n't let me see barbara . barbara was dead . 
the storms have done everything they can to me i do n't hate them . i do n't even hear the wind . it blows beyond me . it was on such a night as this that barbara died . 
my daughter died long ago . 
my daughter barbara died when she was six . that was long ago . you 're only the woman who keeps care of me . i know you . 
such a brief visit but dear child it has made my christmas very merry . 
wait a minute . listen . 
that 's from her -- that woman . 
... at the hour of midnight down the road that goes through sleepy hollow across the bridge he goes galloping galloping always searching always seeking 
on the dark nights  on the stormy nights -- you can hear him . he passes like the wind ; the flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings . the thunder of his horse 's hooves is loud loud and louder beating hard beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding riding riding . 
let the child stay . 
good night mother good night . 
if that child comes here ... if i find her trying to steal your love from me ... i'll kill her . yes i 'll kill her : 
there 's another promise you must make me . that little girl who comes here ... she must n't ever come to see you again . promise me you wo n't see her . 
promise me you wo n't forget tomorrow . you 'll remember wo n't you ? you wo n't say that it was just a dream . promise me . 
mother ! you called me by name ! 
and my hair ... what color hair did barbara have ? 
and my eyes ... my eyes are gray . look ! you see ! 
look at me . look at me mother darling . look into my eyes . what color eyes did barbara have ? 
oh does n't that prove something to you ? does n't it ? 
but i am barbara . i did n't die . 
i hate the storm . i hate it ! 
you did n't even open my present and i 'm your daughter . 
look at me . 
never felt better . 
i 've been working out . 
yul brynner . they 're all dead . 
you should n't smoke . it 'll kill you . 
i 've changed a lot lately . 
sorry do n't mean to be wolfing down . i 'm just starving . 
does she have pms ? 
god i hope so . hey can i call you later ? peter 's still here . he 's in the shower . 
never been better . peter spent the night . i must really love him . he 's still alive . 
yes just check on me once a day for the next three days . then the pms should be over . 
i wish i only had your problems . 
i thought you and george were getting married . 
did i kill a guy named benito ? 
about mark ? carlton ? 
no . i ca n't take that chance . i 'd rather kill myself . 
but how do i know if i really love peter ? and if he really loves me ? 
i 'm just afraid i 'll hurt peter . i think i love him . 
i tried to kill myself -- earlier . it does n't work . i think i need silver bullets . so i got depressed and when i 'm depressed i clean . 
i 'm cleaning my stove . 
i think i already have . 
so what do i do ? 
so ... she was a werewolf . do you think we can believe all this ? 
guess she never found true love . 
who is this madame sconce ? let 's find her and talk to her . 
great so all i have to do is fall in love ? like i have n't tried that for the past 24 years . 
the thing is i really like him . i finally meet a guy i really like and i 'm a fuckin ' werewolf . 
peter keeps asking me out . 
you 're such a good friend . 
probably for three weeks or so anyway . i 'm not sure -- i do n't get how it works . 
i think i just got my period . 
peter knows something . 
what the fuck are we going to do ? 
fuck it 's the cops . peter saw me now i have to let him in . 
you should have seen it erect . 
that 's a terrible thing to say . frida goes back to scrubbing the floor . 
i could smell another woman on him . 
i think i turned into a werewolf and killed him . 
you 're right . it 's just i ca n't cover up a murder so george wo n't know you 're cheating . 
you 're cheating on george ? jennifer how could you ? 
what ? why 'd you do that ? 
why not ? there 's been a murder . 
i should call the police . oh no peter . peter is the police ! 
yeah i guess . mark ? 
i do n't know ... i 'm spaced out ... he was taking a shower ... he must be still in there . 
holy shit i do n't know . 
okay i got ta go . 
oh my god jennifer . i should go to confession . 
oh no . 
shit i guess i missed work . 
i 've been here . what day is it ? 
i do n't know . you have to take sammy . he 's afraid of me . 
i have n't gotten it yet . 
it took me an hour to clean it up . that was not in my head ! 
no last night i think i chased carlton around as a wolf and killed him . i woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed . and my throat hurts . 
because of pms i get hairy my nails turn into claws i eat raw meat i roam the city hunting for flesh . i 've become a werewolf ! 
i put it down the garbage disposal . 
please come over . i 'm begging you . what should i do with the arm ? should i call the cops or ... peter ? 
no ! not fucked him i think i killed him . 
jennifer . a severed arm . it 's bloody and ... i 'm not sure but it may be carlton 's . 
there is a man 's arm in my bed . 
i look like fuckin ' chewbacca . 
yes they are ! look how much more hair i have than you ! 
oh my god look . my arms are so hairy ! 
no you do n't believe me . 
i ca n't help it . my bra would n't even fit . i 've been going to victoria 's secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still i 'm busting out . it 's this pms . 
it is so hot in here . 
what did he say ? 
you 're just saying that . 
i started out on that eye - of - newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate . 
okay . i guess so . 
it 's just as well . i 'm afraid of getting hurt again . mark seemed great at first too . i do n't want to get too attached to peter and then find out he 's a creep . 
we almost slept together ... and ... then the hair started and i booked . 
i looked like an italian man ! 
i 'm freaking out . i 'm like an animal and totally out of control . my arms keep getting really hairy . 
what the hell is the tampon test ? 
i do n't know much about him . how do you know if a guy is decent ? 
i do n't think i 've ever actually liked anyone i 've dated before . peter even likes me without makeup . 
i 'm sorry . i did n't want you to think i was still a doormat . 
um he stopped by yesterday before you came over . 
i wonder if he 's married . 
he was cute huh ? of course whenever i meet a guy i 'm wearing no make - up . 
no mark wears boxers . they must have been in the dryer already . 
my vision got worse again . 
and my bra finally fits again . 
i think i went in and fell asleep . i guess gregory walked home and got killed ! i blacked out . 
he was trying to get into my apartment and ... i know this sounds gross but i was so turned on . i grabbed him and kissed him ! 
i could n't stop eating steak . i felt out of control -- like i was making up for all those years being a vegetarian . i could n't get enough . and then gregory walked me home ... and he peed in front of me . 
i ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with gregory . 
i do n't remember . we kissed at my door and next thing i knew i woke up with my period . alone . 
no . i do n't think so . 
did i kill him ? of course not ! 
why would they exaggerate ? 
and he was ripped limb from limb ? 
he 's dead ? am i bad luck or what ? 
oh my glasses ! maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them . 
holy shit i 'm a freak . 
where ? where do you think a mustache would be . look ! 
i never thought of it like that . i never know what to do on dates . do guys still pay ? 
maybe they have to pee . 
you 're so lucky you have george and do n't need to go on dates anymore . 
why did gregory ask me out ? i mean he 's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea . 
george bit you ? 
i think she broke the skin . 
even on sale that stuff 's a fortune . i worked all week to pay for a bra . 
can you believe she fuckin ' bit me ? 
where are all the mediums ? 
i do n't know . 
what do i need overpriced fancy underwear for ? should n't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie ? 
or if there 's a full moon . 
no it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye . 
only to see . 
you 're just saying that . 
i 'd kill for just a little bloated . 
sorry . it 's just so bad lately . you 're so lucky you never get pms . 
my date always pays more attention to you than to me . 
he has n't said one word to me . 
i wonder what it 's like being you . being noticed all the time . 
i guess i have a weakness for him . it 's those big brown bambi eyes . 
he 's a very talented musician . 
my shrink says he 's not so bad . 
translation : a total geek . 
yeah even then look what happened : michael mortenson kissed you and billy sullivan threw a worm at me . 
i have cramps . i ca n't believe i let you talk me into this . 
yeah . whip it out . you want me to see it -- that 's what this is all about right ? 
uh huh . so pee . 
you 're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you 're hoping that 'll turn into something else . 
you do n't have to pee . 
oh come on . knock it off . 
my apartment 's just such a mess . 
you should have gone at the restaurant . 
well i have it worse than cramps . goodnight gregory . 
no . really i 'm ... i do n't feel well . i 've got terrible pms . 
i 'm really tired . 
i 'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner . 
that 's great . highly original . 
i 'm not really hungry after all . 
you 're kidding really ? 
i do development for tv movies . 
i know . 
take your shower . 
my bra is my biggest supporter . 
somehow this winds up being my fault ? you always blame me . 
you think that story 's gon na make me loan you money ? 
so pay them back and apologize . 
this really is n't a good time . 
it 's mark . 
where 'd you get the bike ? 
you have n't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me ! 
yeah right ... you better go . 
worried about what all your girlfriends might think ? 
i ca n't help it it smells so good . 
oh my god i 'm sorry ! 
you never say that . 
since when do you care ? 
no . i quit . take your lame ass ideas your fake ass toupee your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them . 
mr. grant . did you read that script i was talking about ? 
i think we should do something with strong female characters ... 
i ca n't read any more crap . these women are all victims . 
a little . 
your desk . 
on your desk . 
on your desk . 
here 's a towel . 
i 'm so sorry ... i ... i could n't help it . you know i did n't mean to ... to do any of that . 
what about ... those guys ... i might have ... 
worse than this ? 
maybe we should have children . i do n't think i 'd kill the father of my child . 
no . it does n't work that way . men ca n't get pms . unfortunately . 
be careful ! 
i ca n't take that chance ... i could n't live with myself if i did anything to you . 
how do you know ? 
peter i love you too but ... 
go away . i might hurt you . 
i knew you would n't believe me ! just go away . go very far away ! 
no you ca n't . it ... it gets so bad that i become a werewolf . 
you want the truth ? remember i tried to tell you something the other day ? 
yes sort of . i mean no not really . 
no ! do n't come over . peter ... i ... i do n't want to see you anymore . ever . 
i did shave ... do i seem hairy ? peter laughs . 
they do ? oh no ... 
i loaned him to jennifer . george moved out and she was lonely ... 
they 're for my cat . i use them to train him not to rip up paper . 
i love you too . 
like i had to say it ? no i wanted to say it . 
no my bite 's a lot worse . 
interesting possibility . 
no but thanks for the warning . 
what 's that supposed to mean ? 
i just do n't know if i should be dating anyone right now . 
what happened ? 
no i got it . it 's okay . 
yeah sort of . where 's lloyd ? 
no why ? 
but you said the bodies were ripped to pieces ? 
mark would n't hurt a fly . 
it was n't a date . jennifer invited me along to dinner with them . 
uh ... the buzzer 's broken . i 'll be down in a second . 
uh .... hi ! 
everything okay ? 
no ! i ... i checked when i put my stuff in . i always look through the washer first . 
no . nope nothing in it . 
i 'm sorry -- i 'm on edge today . 
oh my god you scared the shit out of me . you following me again ? 
no . no i 'm fine . maybe i should go . i mean ... i do n't want our first time to be like this . 
my period ? no . 
what 's wrong ? 
okay you busted me . 
what are they for ? 
what are those ? 
yeah . maybe . 
i really got ta get going . 
he 's bad news . he cheated on me he insults me . now suddenly he gets jealous if i have a date . 
cool . i do n't get guys who wear boxers . my ex wore boxers . i never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up . 
how about you ? briefs or boxers ? 
a lot of people do n't wear underwear . 
like what ? 
i 've read scripts about detectives but never met one . must be wild . 
i 'm so sorry peter . gee that sure puts my problems in perspective . 
oh my god by wolves ? 
i 'm sorry . 
used to ? did it stop finally ? 
it 's stupid . 
oh it 's nothing . 
no . really . i do n't drink coffee anymore . i used to love it but my tastes have changed recently . 
i 'm trying to stay away from caffeine . 
that 's my ex . he 's an asshole . in case you could n't tell . i think he 's been following me . 
i got ta get going . peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag . 
are you following me ? 
i wish i could help but last i saw gregory was outside my front door . 
we ... he walked me home and ... we said goodnight . um he kissed me goodnight and that was it . 
cause i 'm a fucking werewolf ! ! 
we did n't have sex . 
i do n't know . i do n't remember doing it . 
i ate a guy last night . 
i think i 'm a werewolf . 
that i 'm a doormat of course . the shrink makes more notes . 
no he 's not . he 's a courier . he picks up packages from the airport . 
no i have a cat . 
no . we left the restaurant and ... and i felt sick ... so ... so i took a cab home . alone . 
what makes you think i was the last one ? 
yes jennifer told me . what does that have to do with me ? 
no take it . 
no i said it was our first date . 
no it was our first date . 
yes ... i ... we had dinner . 
oh my god what happened ? 
sure . see ya . 
oh thank god . maybe this whole thing is really over . 
frida ? you okay ? 
sorry -- i should n't go on about myself at a time like this . are you sure you 're going to be okay ? 
we were -- i was just so tempted ... it was sort of a test . i think after sleeping with benito i know i want to be with george . but now george knows about benito and he does n't want to be with me ! 
no he 's the guy i 'm having an affair with . 
about benito . 
i think george knows . 
no . i wo n't let you do that . 
i guess you 'll find out . 
remember what madame sconce said . if you love him he 'll be fine . 
you 'll get through this . you were fine for over three weeks . 
you scared the shit out of me . i thought you were killing yourself . 
fall in love . 
what choice do we have ? 
the weird thing is ... he shot her with a silver bullet . 
she died at age 34 in the 1800 's . they thought she was crazy . she was banished from her town . seems her husband shot her . 
check out what i found . 
we do n't know you 're a werewolf . it might never happen again . you have to get on with your life . 
maybe you should go out with him . if you keep avoiding him he 'll get suspicious . besides what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who 's investigating you . 
symptoms include loss of emotional control compulsive behavior cravings crying spells ... 
so are you . look go about your life . act like nothing 's wrong . we 'll get to the bottom of this . 
let 's do some research . i 'll check the libraries . you surf the web . 
does that mean this whole thing is over ? 
well if he does he did n't give you away . he must really like you . 
hide him . 
tell them you 'll meet them outside . 
ignore it . 
you expecting someone ? 
at least i finally saw the reason you could n't get over mark . 
okay let 's say that this is pms- related . you think those male cops are going to understand that ? you 'll either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin . we have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves . 
if you ask me the fucker got what he deserved . i 'm glad he 's dead . 
why the fuck would you do that ? 
you say murder but you have no idea what happened . you do n't remember doing it so it 's out of your control . 
how could i ? i 'm helping you clean up mark 's remains and you ask how could i cheat on george ? 
there 's kind of this guy i 'm seeing . 
first of all you 're my alibi . i told george i was with you last night . 
don't call the police . 
what happened to his tooth ? 
he 's been here all night ? 
did you get rid of mark ? 
i 'm stopping by later . i 'm worried about you . bye . 
get rid of him ! 
relax . carlton was torn apart . no way could you have done that . maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out ... or ... 
and he was missing an arm . 
frida carlton 's dead . 
tuesday . are you okay ? 
frida ? i was worried to death about you . i 've called you for two days . where have you been ? 
frida listen to yourself . if i said i was a werewolf would you believe me ? 
maybe the blood was from your period like before . 
you 're delusional . maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood . and the severed arm ... well i do n't see it and ... maybe this is all in your head . 
you 're a pms werewolf . of course . frida are you on drugs ? 
and what makes you think you killed a man ? 
so where 's this infamous arm now ? 
frida you 're not making sense . i ca n't come over right now . 
you fucked carlton ? see i told you he liked you . 
frida this is a bad time . we 're having sex and george actually answered the phone . 
it 's just cause mine is finer . a little bleach'll fix that . 
no they 're not . 
geez i wish i 'd get it like that . 
you might want to tape your nipples down next time . it 's really distracting . 
i still thought it was a purse . 
charming carlton . 
i think he called you beautiful . 
well whatever it was seems to have worked cause you look great . 
great . george is meeting carlton first for drinks . we can meet and go together . it 'll be a blast . 
no he did n't . come on i do n't want to be alone with those two . all they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me . 
hey carlton 's in town -- come out with the three of us . 
frida this hair thing is all in your head . you 're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone . 
how 'd it go with the cop ? 
you have to stop being so self- critical frida . 
give him the tampon test . 
hmmm . sounds suspicious . 
frida i 'm your friend . i 'm not judging you ... you did n't sleep with the creep did you ? 
why did n't you tell me ? you said you had n't seen him for a month . 
gross so this is mark 's flesh ? when did you see him ? 
he was n't wearing a ring . but you do n't want to date a cop frida . they 're so blue collar . 
rule one : always wear make - up . 
uh huh ... good thing those cops did n't see that . 
are those mark 's ? 
i thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses . 
at least your pms is over . 
and then ? 
what ? why the hell did he do that ? 
i guess you 're off that vegetarian kick you 've been on for ten years . 
did you get smashed or what ? you have to eat if you 're drinking . and not just those little salads . 
you do n't think so ? you either did or your did n't . 
no did you fuck him ? 
so did you do it ? 
to sound like big macho cops . he was probably just found with a knife in his back . 
i 'm sure they were exaggerating . 
there you go blaming yourself for everything again . 
hey did you get contacts ? 
you are not frida we all have a little hair there . i did n't even notice till you showed me . we can bleach that it 's no big deal . 
i do n't see anything . maybe just a little . 
they better . of course trouble is you never know what they 'll expect for it . you got ta know what to order and what you 're willing to do . like if a guy spends a fortune on you he 's gon na feel like you owe him something . 
maybe he likes you ever think of that ? it 's good for you to go out -- get your mind off mark . 
i kind of asked him to . we were you know ... he got a little carried away ... 
what a bitch . you should see a doctor . that can be dangerous . george bit me once and i had to go to the emergency room . 
and she got the medium . 
frida grab that red one . 
there 's a sale . it 's such a nice place -- classical music relaxing atmosphere . you deserve to pamper yourself . come on it ca n't hurt . 
it 's not about him seeing you in it . it 's how you feel . you 'll feel sexy in lingerie and it 'll show . it 's an inner thing . 
okay just one more stop and you 'll be all set . victoria 's secret . 
or if your boyfriend 's an asshole . 
try to get through dinner without them . you have beautiful eyes . 
ca n't you get contacts ? 
do you really need these ? 
how about i give you a make - over ? you 'll feel better about yourself . you 're actually pretty you 're just not bringing it out . 
i get a little bloated sometimes . 
frida i do n't mean this as a criticism but you might not want to talk about pms around men . 
maybe he 's just shy . 
people notice you frida . 
so do n't look in his eyes . 
every woman at some point has to date a musician . i wish you 'd get rid of mark for good . every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out . 
your shrink always gives you bad advice . he only hears what you choose to tell him . mark 's an asshole he cheated he borrowed money and never paid it back he 's never had a regular job . 
anything 's better than mark . 
well that 's not going to happen tonight . george said carlton 's a nice guy . 
come on we 've been double dating since the fourth grade . 
she 's my best friend . i got ta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds . i 've been in some bad relationships and she 's been there for me . she 's lonely . if pretending she 's a werewolf helps then more power to her . 
take some allergy medicine . 
do n't be stupid george . obviously if she 's a werewolf she ca n't be around a cat . she might eat it and besides cats are afraid of wolves . 
it 's so bad she becomes a werewolf . 
tell her i 'm eating . 
so now being with frida is lucky ? i thought you said she was a flake . 
i wonder how frida and carlton are getting along ? 
she 's just insecure . once you get to know her she 's fabulous . 
come on i 've been working with frida . carlton wo n't even recognize her now . she 's really coming out of her shell . 
yeah and when we 're mad at each other we 're out of sync . it only works if you 're on good terms . 
see he was cheating from the get go . 
i do n't know i guess the outfits are cool . and i want a big gun . 
i was thinking about becoming a cop myself . do you take a test or something or just sign up ? 
you want her sheets ? 
how the hell is that your business ? 
jesus christ she got her period . relax guys . it happens . 
yeah ... it could be fun . 
oh ... i lived with a president .   it is n't any fun . 
so this is it ? 
... me too . 
i know . 
yeah well ... it 's finally over . 
) thought i needed a little change .   you like it ? 
yeah .    he 's a good man . 
i sure fall for some weird guys . 
you really believe that ? 
they 're crucifying you out there . 
looks like we 're not going to get a chance to get much done . 
i mean i want to ... i just i feel strange ... 
i ca n't . 
yeah ... bedtime . 
it was inspirational . 
but you could go to jail for it . 
you know dave -- it is dave is n't it ?   i ca n't keep all of this a secret . 
it 's just more than anybody else does around here . 
you find people jobs ? 
so what do you do the rest of the time ? 
you have a lot of secrets . 
i really do n't have much of an appetite . 
he was n't always like that anyway . 
i lock at you and i see bill ...   i mean he 's almost dead but he 's right here ... i mean you 're right here ... alive and ... 
it 's just so strange ... 
oh ... okay . 
you do n't have to keep walking with me .    i 'm okay from here . 
you sure this goes somewhere ? 
i do n't know .   i had n't thought it out that far . 
you1re leaving too ? 
oh they did n't brief you on that ? how sloppy of them . 
i 'm not the first lady anymore .   i should n't be here . 
i 'm sure they did .   ' state of emergency . '   ' national security . ' you ever hear of the constitution ? 
when were you all planning to tell me ? a year from now ?    after the election ...   what 's going on here ? dave hesitates . 
i mean what is it ?   another secretary ? a jaunt to the bahamas with some ' campaign worker . '   where is he ? 
you were n't in the state legislature . 
kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature . 
oh i do n't think so .   still you helped a lot of people . 
that was quite a thing you did today . 
mind if i sit down ? 
i saw the light .   i thought maybe you were up . 
there 's no mistake bill .    if you veto their funding it 's not a mistake . if you hurt someone intentionally it 's not a mistake . 
you made their funding disappear ! 
that 's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes ...   ... when i think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick ... 
... you know if you want to be the same old bastard that 's fine .   i can handle it .    but do n't pull this ' man of the people ' bullshit and then do something like this . 
oh come on bill .   do n't patronize me .    i 'm not one of your little ...   turn around .   i 'm talking to you ! ... turnaround ! 
yeah .   i 'm sure it 's keeping you up nights . 
since when do you care about the homeless ? 
you do n't change do you bill ? 
do n't you have anything to say to me ? 
i 'm outta here . 
go tuck yourself bill . 
what are you staring at ? 
come on . 
let 's just .... wait a minute . get a better look . 
what is it ? 
no . i did n't stop the infection in time . i know .   do n't worry . when he dies i wo n't be like maria . i 'll shoot him . 
help me get him to the boat . 
how long do we have to watch him ? 
it's ... he was ... one who came to the island with me . 
looks like just two . we can take 'em when the time comes . 
there 's hundreds of 'em . right where we landed our boat . 
datura ! miguel knew it ! datura he was shouting ! datura metel ! 
toby 's right . they 're not gon na sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys . 
let me go ! i 'm the one he wants . this is all happening because of me . if i turn myself in ... 
they seem to be havin' a good time . some punishment . 
no . they just try to hold you for ransom . fuck you moses ! i 'm outa here ! 
i can find it myself . i did n't come that far . 
look . i been fightin ' mister . i been fightin ' for what feels like a hundred years and i 'm finished . i do n't need religion . i do n't need prayers . i need a couple guns and a couple hands . we can sail on outa here . find another island where there ai n't so much .... traffic . 
oh what did i run into ? a bunch o ' jesus nuts ? religiosos ? prayer wo n't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer wo n't keep one of those monsters from eatin ' your liver for lunch . 
we thought we were escaping here . we thought we 'd found an uninhabited island . christ ! this place is a worse nightmare than anything i 've seen yet ! 
it 's a disease . it 's a ... a bug ... a parasite that infects the brain . 
the man i was with ... until today ... believed that praying was for blind men who could n't see the truth . 
thanks . i can fight my own battles . 
we ran up against a platoon of soldiers . there were actually walking dead ... in uniform ... with guns . 
governor dickerson ? of florida ? 
chet you do n't have to hurt him . 
knox ? ! 
do n't stop . 
oh chet that feels fabulous

you throw mighty far jabez -- almost into the pigsty . 
she 'll be here in a moment . she has a special surprise for you . 
mr. webster -- you will help him ? 
oh -- mr. webster -- i 'm so glad you came ! 
oh could you mr. webster ? 
you see i do n't care if we are rich or poor -- i do n't care if we 're big or small all i care about is jabez . he was the first man i loved . he never used to care about money -- we were poor as job 's turkey but none of us minded . now i 've seen him drive the poor from the door and we used to be poor ourselves . i 've seen him get hard and mean and he is n't hard or mean . i 've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding . that 's not like him mr. webster -- it must be my fault somehow -- my fault . 
mr. webster you must n't believe all that people say . 
why -- yes -- it 's hard to put it into words mr. webster . there 's this matter of little daniel 's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there 's something else that 's wrong -- it gets worse year after year -- it 's like a shadow growing -- i ca n't really talk about it even to ma -- she puts it all on jabez and i wo n't stand for that . 
goodness mr. webster i 've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner . 
of course not -- 
no really thank you . -- is mrs. webster coming back soon ? 
-- i 'm going to try mr. webster . 
it is . 
no .   this really pissed him off sonny .   he says you 're dead .   he says he does n't have a son . 
oh .   run . 
what 'll you do ?   come out . 
i know you would n't need leon if heidi was treating you right .   the thing i do n't understand is why you come out and sleep with heidi anyway ?   you got two kids on welfare now .   what 're you goin' to bed with her you do n't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare you want a wife and three kids on welfare ? 
if she comes down here so help me i 'm gon na mash her brains in . everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her .   since then forget it . 
did i say a thing against her ?   god forbid i should say anything against that fat cunt . 
what 's wrong with that ?   the fbi was very understanding when i explained it to him .   everybody knows it is n't you ... it 's the pressures from your home life . 
oh my god !   i do n't understand .   if you needed money why could n't you come to me ?   everything i got is yours .   i got two hundred and maybe twenty - five in the savings .   it 's yours .   you know it . 
he was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... algeria ? 
i said you were never a faggot . 
well i 'm only trying to get you outta this .   i told them you were in vietnam you always had good jobs you were with goldwater at the ' 64 convention but you had marital problems ... 
i talked to the fbi i told them about you they said if you just come outta the bank it 's gon na be okay . 
my god sonny - you oughtta see - alla brooklyn is here !   on all 3 networks ! 
< i > i once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone anything.</i > 
what is it choco ? 
who the hell is that ? 
< i > choco grew up on the streets of el salvador . when he was four years old ... he stabbed another kid in the eye - ball with a pencil.</i >   < i > there were wires crossed somewhere in his soul.</i > 
i 've been training since i was twelve . knives . guns . throwing stars . you name it ... i can fight with it . i 'm a hard worker and a fast learner .   nothing scares me . i 'm not afraid to die . 
what ! ! ? 
you 're breaking up ... i ca n't hear you . 
< i > what happened to them?</i > 
why the hell are we delivering them out here ? i ca n't even find any warrants in the system for these four . 
i became a bounty hunter because of cunts like you .   i remember all the cunts in high school who were mean to me . eventually ... they all grew up to be just like you . angry and bitter because they peaked early ... and now they 're stuck in some dead end marriage ... or worse yet ... an unfulfilling job that keeps them from meeting a man . 
do you want know the real reason why i became a bounty hunter ? 
take us to vegas . < b > ext . desert road -- day < /b > the crew rides in the back of the wanderer 's truck toward vegas . < b > int . vegas security lockdown -- night < /b > domino stares at taryn as she returns to the table . 
< i > now the bitch was getting personal.</i > 
take us to vegas . 
show me the tapes . i want to see them . 
< i > the bitch was bluffing . there were no dupe tapes . if there were ... they 'd have shown them to me by now.</i > 
< i > her car was in the shop.</i > 
we needed to verify some bond certificates for claremont . she pushes stuff through the system for us ... helps us track down perps for a kick back . it 's all legal . < b > int . mustang convertible -- [ flashback ] day < /b > 
that 's the rumor on the street . 
he 's a reality television producer . his name is mark weiss . 
he sent us out to the fender compound . out in the desert near the chicken ranch . 
you 're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself ... and it 's not working . i said i 'd tell you everything i know . you and your friends behind the mirror . 
i do n't know . 
< i > here 's the part where i 'm supposed to get all defensive and say ... ' not until i speak with my attorney . '</i > 
< i > mescaline.</i > < b > int . cast winnebago -- night < /b > domino and the others are all drinking coffee . alf stares out through the windshield at the glow of vegas in the distance . 
< i > either this was some kind of set up ... or the first ladies got scared ... decided to pull out and cut their losses.</i > 
is that the decoder ? 
turn over your weapon edna ! 
he 's still alive edna ! 
nice to see you again edna . 
chi - chi has gone to doggie heaven bitch ! 
< i > that 's my best friend . his name is choco . he 's always fancied me ... but too shy to ever do anything about it.</i > 
< i > it was the beginning of the end.</i > 
he used to date pat benatar ! 
it 's choco . and he 's not my boyfriend . he 's a bounty hunter . 
cunt . it 's just a word . why does everyone in this fucking country get their knickers in a twist by the slightest bit of indecent conversation ? 
i refuse to turn out like them . twenty - one years old and they 're already looking for a husband .   stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem . they let the boys control their lives . not me . 
the mold ? i am living among these crypto - fascist orange county cunts ... with daddy 's bmw and the boob job ... just waiting to implode . 
everything . it is a ghastly existence . 
then so be it . if you believe what that indian said we were fucked either way . 
< i > turned out edna . had one last trick up her sleeve.</i > < b > int . fender compound -- kitchen -- [ flashback ] ten minutes ago 
he said ... take his right arm . 
something is going down . something bad . 
what do you mean ? claremont did n't provide them ? 
where are the bond certificates for the first ladies ? 
you have sixty seconds ... here 's the question ...   which one of you is frances ? 
you're under arrest . 
you 're wearing eyeliner . you look like a queen . 
< i > i was asleep in mum 's guest house.</i > < b > int . sophie thomas mansion -- bedroom -- next < /b > domino is asleep in bed . the telephone rings . 
< i > mum was terrified for me . she did n't approve of my lifestyle one bit.</i > 
how did you meet choco ? 
oh my god ... you mean ... the two of you dated ? ! 
i ... < i > love ... </i > pat benatar . 
really ? did you play in a band ? 
so ed . what did you do before you became a bounty hunter ? 
no last names . just domino . the less you know about me the better okay ? 
you can save that pretty woman shit . the name is domino . 
because i want justice . i want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong .   and i want to have a little fun . 
where the fuck do you think you 're going ? 
< i > my real father was an actor . he died when i was a little girl.</i > 
i can certainly think of one more ! 
i 'm down but for a worthwhile cause . 
buggin ' out i do n't mean to be disrespectful but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way .

harry ? are you okay ? 
just down the hall . 
what ? well now i 'm in a position where i may just heed your help . 
well i 'll tell you what i think . i think she and principal collins are embezzling money from the school and i think they 've been doing it for years . 
sit down i have something to tell you . 
lloyd ? what about ms. heller ? 
i checked with the school board she 's not an accredited teacher . 
okay there 's a lot for us to go over so it may get hard for you . 
would you like something to drink ? 
wipe your feet . my parents are totally anal . 
come over around seven . 
you and lloyd chose the class ! ? 
are you trying to be funny ? or are you actually re-- re ... special 
oh harry you 're so funny . now i have something that 's kind of delicate ... 
you did ? 
that 's because ms. heller does n't want you to know this whole thing is a scam . 
a field trip ? maybe i 'll join you . see you tomorrow . 
yes you and the whole special needs class . 
hey guys . 
yeah well i 'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece but nothing really ever happens around here . but i chose you and that 's fine .   i 'm jessica matthews . 
i 've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper . it was either a feature on you or the new four - color ink pens at the student store . 
you 're the kid who was home schooled . 
oh yeah . i do n't think they do . you 're new here right ? 
excuse me . 
look ms. heller there 's something fishy here and i do n't think it 's friday 's special . 
you mean the lunch room ? 
why are you teaching special needs ? you 're the lunch lady . 
are you wearing a coconut bra ? 
so can i come along ? 
well when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps i think it 's newsworthy . 
ms . heller mind if i tag along on your field trip ? i 'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class . 
that 's not your tape . 
that 's not your tape . 
i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
so what did you say to my parents on the phone ? 
my parents are going to wonder where i am . 
i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
last year toby was in a.p. english . and lewis won the science fair . what are they doing in special needs ? 
and ching chong you 're not a special needs kid . you 're just a foreign exchange student . 
being a jerk does n't make you special . 
turk what are you doing here ? 
turk leave him alone . 
he 's going to be in jail for a long time . 
do n't worry about me i 'll be fine . i can take care of myself and i 'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of . 
lloyd when we were in principal collins 's office did you see any kind of chest ? 
harry ! lloyd ! you guys are a mess . 
thanks lloyd . but i did n't find what i was looking for . oh can you do me a favor and clean up ? collins ca n't know we were here . 
that 's my boyfriend . 
no it was a complete waste of time . 
that 's it . i 'm done . 
i 'm so close i can feel it . 
let 's just do it and get out of here . 
uh thanks . god i 'm so excited ! so are you ready to take me to the principal 's office ? he whips out the key she takes it .

oh no i know that class is n't for me . but i 'm happy for you guys . 
harry i heard collins has you in some kind of special class . 
i 'll talk to you later . 
i would n't know . being that i 'm just the teacher and all . 
i thought i told you to get lost . 
dietician ! this interview is over . you can have the camera back tomorrow . come by the classroom . heller heads off . 
oh you 're good . 
nevertheless you could have mentioned the sauce .   well i see you have a camera .

we felt his presence . 
you must n't speak of ... 
stop him jessica ! 
they tried and died . 
... many men have tried . 
what can be done has been done . 
i sense your teachings in him . ignore the regular order of training . his safety requires the voice . 
they tried and died ....   jessica ! 
do you know of the water of life ? ... the truthsayer drug ? 
the person who can be many places at once ... the one who bridges space and time .... he will look where we can not . 
perhaps you are the kwisatz haderach . 
your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams . i only want to know one thing .... do they come true ? 
pain by nerve induction ... a human can resist any pain . our test is crisis and observation . 
no ! ! enough ! ! kull wahad ! no woman child ever withstood that much . i must have wanted you to fail . take your hand out of the box and look at it young human .... do it ! 
you feel the flesh crisping ? 
silence ... silence . 
let us say i suggest you may be human . your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts . your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box . if you do so you will die . you will feel an itching -- there ... see ? now the itching becomes burning ... heat upon heat upon heat . 
i hold at your neck the gom jabbar . do n't pull away or you 'll feel that poison . a duke 's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals .

my truck overheated so i opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt . so i had to get a haircut . 
you were n't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any   man i admit -- and my problem is if i think i 'm losing i pull myself out of the game . i bail . see ? i told you i 'm the love coroner . 
this is going right up your ass . 
everybody 's someone . 
the what ? 
no ... could you ? 
no . it 's your fault . 
... yeah ? 
yeah ... i saw that girl come on to you at the tv show . 
are you all right ? 
i feel like a criminal or like we 're cheating on someone . 
i 'm sorry . 
so my little brother 's staying here . i 'm sleeping with rita . 
i tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to atlantic city . 
there 's a list . 
twenty - nine . 
page three of the post . 
look at this . 
everybody hates me ! 
i have no privacy . even now ! i 'm crying and i ca n't stop and they wo n't go away . and now it 's going to be another month ! 
ed ... i think we should stop seeing each other . 
... yeah then but ... 
i really like you too ... 
i know i ... 
i know but even if they go away everybody in america knows what we 're doing because ... they went away . 
that 's lucky . 
oh yeah . 
the what ? 
you should see the one we wear when it rains . 
yeah well ... 
what are you doing ? 
oh god this is so weird . 
me too . i mean i 'm going out with ray and i 'm ... thinking about you . 
leave . go . 
i kissed my boyfriend 's brother on television ! 
oh my god . 
i mean bad . 
i 've got news for you-- i never intended to marry him . 
do n't defend that horse 's ass to me . 
what do you want ? ! 
dynamite is dangerous . 
cream rinse ? 
why do it ? 
are you sure about this ? 
oh the whole family loved him . of course they loved the last guy i went out with and he strung me along for three years and dumped me . 
by the x. that 's were two lines cross -- forming an x. 
what would i actually have to do to get you to sign this ? 
by the x. 
sign here please . 
it was the first time somebody ever saw the real me the me that nobody else knows . 
thank you . 
what do you mean ? what kind of person am i ? 
no i 'm not . i 'm just really busy . 
one night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline . eventually dave and i were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student but like two adults . 
i hope so 
i 'm scared mr. m. i kind of do n't feel ready for college . 
take as much room as you want 
would you sign it for me ? 
i just have to get something . i 'll be right back . 
i want you to do something for me . 
my house . 
i 've got an idea . 
nooo .   i just thought ...   l mean i am looking for a new car .   but i just thought well i 'm going away soon and you 'll be stuck here and i do n't know i just think maybe if things had been different we might have been well friends . real friends .   and then things would be different .   do n't you think ? 
doing what ? 
that sounds good . 
uh - huh . 
where to ? 
well i got in everywhere i applied but cornell is my first choice . 
my mother 's buying me a new car for college . 
i 'm looking at new cars . 
hello mr. m. 
act surprised . walk slowly to the podium .   be modest .   thank them for this incredible honor . 
i told you !   i told you !   you 're going to pay for my banner ! 
what do you mean ? 
i do n't know what you 're referring to but i do know that if certain older and wiser people had n't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy everything would be okay . 
why are you lecturing me ? 
well i do n't know .   it could have been anybody .   there are a lot of you know subversive elements around millard .   you know like rick thieson and kevin speck and those burn - outs .   or doug schenken - what about him ?   or what about tammy metzier ?   her whole thing is being anti- this and anti - that . 
i do n't .   i just know they were there when i left .   i 'm giving you helpful information is all .   you know instead of wasting time interrogating me we should be out there trying to find out who did this . 
i was .   so ?   mr. pecharda let me in . as you know with all my responsibilities i often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so . but i left very early around 6:30 . 
mr. m. i am running on my qualifications .   i would never need to resort to you know to vandalism like a you know ... plus my own best banner was torn down .   did i do that too ? 
wait - are you accusing me ? you 're not serious .   i ca n't ... mr. mcallister we have worked together on sga for three solid years and ... i mean i ca n't believe it . i 'm ... i 'm shocked ! 
if it 's about the posters i think it 's so awful . it 's a travesty . 
tim kobza ?   tim kobza !   who 's he ? i 've never heard of him ! 
these are a bunch of burn - outs . and look at this one i ca n't even read this one . 
are you sure all her signatures are real ?   it 's not easy to get all those signatures . 
you 're the advisor .   you should stop her .   she 's not qualified .   she 's just a sophomore . 
fuck me mr. mcallister 
okay . that 's good . i just wanted to make sure . 
you know mr. m. when i win the presidency that means you and i are going to be spending a lot of time together next year .   and i for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive . would n't you ? 
hell you know coca - cola 's the world 's number one soft drink but they spend more money than anybody on advertising . i guess that 's how come they stay number one . 
i ca n't wait to start campaigning . 
thanks for everything . 
i thought you were supposed to keep them . 
are n't you supposed to keep them ? 
could you approve them now ?   i 'd like to kick off my campaign right away you know in the morning . 
here they are . 
i got all my signatures .   one hundred and fifty - eight -- way more than i need ! 
... the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a ... 
ethics are ... 
i know . 
thanks mr. m. 
you know what they say about the early bird . 
good morning mr. mcallister . 
i was lonely .   you took advantage 
we made a mistake .   let 's not make it worse . 
do n't say that .   you know it 's not true . 
yeah .   i 'm here . 
what do you want jim ? 
three twenty - five . 
easy tiger .   come by after school . i 'll leave darryl with the sitter . 
take me to that motel .   like you wanted . 
hey yeah ? 
all his life .   he 's tried everything . 
did you know dave 's a bed wetter ? 
should we get a what ? 
you sure ? 
i ca n't afford this stuff right now . 
more this way . 
could you get this ? i ca n't 
your novel ? are you fucking kidding me ? 
for that matter i think you will too . 
i think she 'll like this very much . 
remain calm . 
i 'll be right back . 
what size ? 
what size ? 
it 's a little late for that . 
very good . 
how 'bout christian dior ? 
it 's okay . i think it 's a wonderful gift . 
you 'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a christmas gift . 
that 's fine . 
do you see anything you like ? 
my guess is male somewhere in his 40 's or 50 's . 
you 're a moron you know that ? 
what makes you think it 's you ? 
i do n't < u > have</u > a life bobby . i 'm in love with a married man . 
this conversation 's over . 
fuck you . when you needed information i got it . you did n't care how . 
i 've never met him ? 
i ca n't . 
we 're screwed . 
you do n't work there anymore bobby . 
for the last four years . 
the irs contacted me this morning . they say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income . 
i got ta go . 
it 's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you . 
good . you 're just what i need right now . 
there are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long i 've worked for the mob . the < u > mob</u > bobby ! 
i got a call from my firm this morning saying do n't come in . 
eat your fish . 
i would n't let you . good luck with depinto . 
you 're not . 
he does n't work that way . 
someone with whom you do n't have quite so personal a-- 
other than me . 
i take a straight 15 percent . brill 's fee varies with risk . perhaps you 'd be more comfortable using someone else . 
it 's how he works . 
what answer were you-- 
here 's what you asked for . brill 's note said it was everything you 'd need to shall we say coax depinto-- 
do you like fish ? 
it is fish . 
how 's the trout ? 
our garden our garden - not so much the garden but the copse alongside it wild a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and france .   the devil 's chimney it was called -   the devil 's chimney i do n't know why .   darling .   my darling . 
i know . 
thank you .   will you bury geoffrey ?   i know he 's dead . 
do you promise ?   i would n't want to die here .   i would n't want to die in the desert . i 've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind with particular hymns .   very english .   and i know exactly where i want to be buried .   in our garden .   where i grew up . with a view of the sea .   so promise me you 'll come back for you . 
oh dear . 
shall we be all right ? 
do n't leave me ! 
it 's so cold . 
of course .   you idiot .   i always wear it . i 've always worn it .   i 've always loved you . 
you speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk . 
do n't you know you drove everybody mad ? 
why did you hate me ? 
it hurts too much . 
please do n't move me .   it hurts too much . 
a surprise he said . 
i ca n't move .   i ca n't get out . 
do you think you 're the only one who feels anything ?   is that what you think ? 
you know why ? he tries to hold her . she resists 
do n't do this . 
would you let me pass ? 
you will .   you will . 
i just know - any minute he 'll find out we 'll barge into somebody we 'll - and it will ill him . 
i 'd better get back .   say goodbye here . 
shall we be all right ? 
that day had you followed me to the market ? 
this is a different world - is what i tell myself .   a different life . and here i am a different wife . 
i thought we were against ownership ?   i can stay tonight . 
you bastard i was believing you ! 
it 's beautiful .   what 's it about ? 
this is - what is this ? 
this is empty just coming ! 
what ?   no ! 
a lie .   what do you hate most ? 
marmite - addicted !   baths - not with other people !   islands .   your handwriting .   i could go on all day .   my husband . almásy nods . 
what do i love ?   i love rice pudding and water the fish in it hedgehogs ! the gardens at our house in freshwater - all my secret paths . 
a woman should never learn to sew and if she can she should never admit to it .   close your eyes . 
you sew very badly . 
i 'm impressed you can sew . 
do n't . 
will you please come in ? 
will you not come in ? 
do they know them ? 
no the marriage is n't a fiction . 
geoffrey 's not in cairo .   he 's not actually a buffoon .   and the plane was n't a wedding present . it belongs to the british government .   they want aerial maps of the whole north africa . so i think he 's in ethiopia .   in case you were counting on his sudden appearance . 
find that plant .   cut out its heart . 
of course .   is it am i a terrible coward to ask how much water we have ? 
oh my god the others ! 
fiction .   we had a house on that coast and it never rained blood . go on .   more . 
yes is a comfort .   absolutely is not . 
shall we be all right ? 
this is not very good is it ? 
they 're so untidy .   i 'm just trying to rearrange them . 
what am i looking at ? 
i 'm quite all right thank you . 
and that would be unconscionable i suppose to feel any obligation ? yes .   of course it would . 
i 'd like you to have them . 
i thought you might paste them into your book . 
ask al auf . almásy asks al auf in arabic . 
you sing .   all the time . 
actually you sing . 
be careful ?   you mean you - or me ? who ? 
what is he saying ?   come on what did he say ? 
sounds perfectly clear .   where does the ostrich come in ? 
what do you mean poetry ? 
so why follow me ?   escort me by all means .   following me is predatory is n't it ? 
you felt obliged to . 
after the market you followed me to the hotel . 
why did you follow me yesterday ? 
excuse me . 
i do n't believe that .   i think you are insulted by me somehow . you 're a foreigner too are n't you here in this market ? 
i do n't care to bargain . 
i do n't want to go back . 
excuse me ? 
seven pounds eight i suppose . why ? 
hello !   good morning . 
yes thank you gyges son of daskylus - candaules said to him i do n't think you believe me when i tell you how beautiful my wife is . and although gyges replied he did find the queen magnificent the king insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women .   do you all know this story ? 
i ca n't sing .   but i can tell a story .   i might need a prompt .   do you have your herodotus ?   i 've noticed you carry it  
is n't zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms ? 
i wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives . 
geoffrey you do so love putting on a disguise . 
ca n't we really go home ?   i ca n't breathe . are n't you dying for green anything green or rain would n't you die to feel rain on your face ? it 's christmas and it 's all - i do n't know - if you asked me i 'd go home tomorrow .   if you wanted . 
are n't you ? 
i 'm not pregnant .   i 'm hot .   i 'm too hot . 
i 'm fine .   i got hot . 
why do you think ?   about my staying ? 
darling for goodness ' sake ! 
oh really ? 
but then the queen looked up and saw gyges concealed in the shadows . and though she said nothing she shuddered . the next day she sent for gyges and challenged him .   and hearing his story she said this - 
i insist .   there clearly is n't room for us all i 'm the least able to dig and i 'm not one of the walking wounded . those are facts .   besides if i remain it 's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he 's doing and rescue us . it 's hard to argue with this logic . 
darling peter says i could stay  
how awful .   what will you do ? 
not at all .   i was thoroughly enjoying by book .   please .   signor d'agostino herr bermann . 
it does n't matter .   really .   i think i can muddle through .   okay - the story of candaules and gyges . king candaules was passionately in love with his wife -   one day he said to gyges the son of somebody anyway - his favorite warrior - 
no please .   i shall be absolutely fine . they pass almásy who does n't look up from his book . 
i think i might go inside and sit down for a few minutes . 
i do n't think so . 
coming .   i ca n't sleep .   i woke up shouting in the middle of the night . geoffrey thinks it 's the thing in the desert the trauma . 
would it ? she kisses him very softly on the lips . 
no i 'll get you some tea . wait till you 're in naples .   you 'll find a girl there . 
your leg will be fine .   a lot of shrapnel came out - i saved you the pieces . 
how are you ? 
i can get in the back . 
buon ' giorno . 
what 's happened ?   kip !   what 's happening ? do n't shoot please do n't shoot anybody . 
i think that 's called looting . 
where did you find that ? 
please do n't creep around this house . 
i do n't know what that means . 
what ?   how could he have ?   when ? 
ask him . 
i 'm not in love with him .   i 'm in love with ghosts .   and so is he . he 's in love with ghosts . 
do n't touch me if you 're going to try and fuck me . 
what do you do ?   what are you doing here ? 
it 's a week .   we did n't know where you were - or if you coming back or - 
i could help you .   i could get you off that . 
where 've you been ? 
because we 're fine here .   i do n't know what mary told you about me but i do n't need company i do n't need to be looked at . 
if you said yes i would have had a reason .   you should let me redress those bandages .   before you go . 
so you can shoot a pistol ? 
so was my patient . 
you were in africa ? 
what do you want ? 
never heard of it . 
would you like me to ? 
you 'd better be . 
hey ! - 
i do n't think it does .   anyway he 's indifferent to me . 
arguing about books . 
kip 's another one . 
good morning .   did you know that ?   you 're always singing ? 
they have to clear all the local roads of mines .   that 's a big job . they wo n't stay in the house . they 're putting up their tent in the garden . 
with his sergeant .   a mr. hardy . 
i liked it better when there were just the two of us . 
my mother always told me i would summon my husband by playing the piano . 
i 'll probably marry him . 
he wants us to move out says there could be fifty more mines in the building . he thinks i 'm mad because i laughed at him .   he 's indian he wears a turban . 
tell me about this this is in your handwriting - december 22nd - betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace .   new lovers are nervous and tender but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire    i love that i believe that .   who is k ? 
yes of course i 'm so sorry . stupid of me . hana gets up upset to have hurt him . 
he keeps asking me questions about you . do you know him ?   do you recognize him ? 
he came back he says he caught a rabbit .   i 'm cooking it . 
this is captain mcgann . 
thank you .   thank you . 
no i ca n't go but if it if you were n't offended it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed . this is as private as we 'll get . 
he 's going back to the front this evening .   i ca n't see him otherwise . 
can i ask - my friend can he come in ? just for a few minutes ? 
excuse me - 
he wo n't disturb us then .   i think he 's after morphine .   there 's a war .   where you come from becomes important .   and besides - we 're vulnerable here . i keep hearing noises in the night . voices . 
he need n't disturb you . 
he 's canadian . 
there 's a man downstairs .   he brought us eggs .   he might stay . 
because i 'm a nurse . 
are you crazy ? 
are you remembering more ? 
no sand .   that 's your drugs speaking . 
i 'm turning you . 
how ?   how can you see anything ? 
i should try and move your bed .   i want you to be able to see the view .   it 's good it 's a view from a monastery . 
are you asleep ? 
when my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure  
candaules  you 're laughing at me . 
i will hide you in the room where we sleep said candaules . she stumbles over the word . 
oh - i 've found plums .   we have plums in the orchard .   we have an orchard ! she has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth . 
i think they 're all in italian but i 'll look yes .   what about your own book ? 
i was repairing the stairs .   i found a library and the books were very useful . 
because you 're leaning ?   no you 're just on an angle .   you 're too heavy ! 
i 'm not sewing anything else for you ! 
i 'm not sewing anything else . 
so one day we 'll meet . 
i 'll always go back to that church . look at my painting . 
i 've clung to you .   i 've clung to you . kip .   life   a raft . 
i 'm thinking about your heart not your skin .   and how to reach it . and that i do n't think i can .   a bomb has ruined us just not the bomb i thought would ruin us . 
is that what you think ?   is that what you think i think ? 
kip   i - 
of course .   when ? 
nya - nya - nya ! 
i should go to the house get breakfast . 
what are you up to ? 
you would n't come to find me ?   that makes me never want to come here . but she continues unraveling the turban . 
but if it got late and i had n't shown up ? 
if one night i did n't come to the tent what would you do ? 
you loved him . 
kip - come and dance with me 
do n't go .   i 'm frightened .   i can love a coward i ca n't love another dead man . 
kiss me .   before i cut .   just in case . 
actually you ca n't cut can you ? you 'll fall over .   give me the pliers . 
i 'm not scared .   so many people have died around me .   but i would be a shame for us .   i do n't feel like being shy . 
i promise you that was the right thing to do .   he 's my good luck .   now cut .   this one .   i hope we do n't die . 
why would anyone do this ? 
i follow the wires . 
so i follow the wires ? 
what do i do ? 
it 's okay - i 'll help .   please . 
i did n't like that book either . it 's all about men .   too many men . just like this house . 
yes for your hair . 
try this .   i found a great jar of it . olive oil .   in naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife . 
i do n't think so . 
no but no not at all .   i 'm sorry . you came to the doors that 's all and -   - such good manners for someone worried about mines .   that 's all . 
i see .   then may be you 're safe as long as you only play bach .   he 's german . kip is looking around the piano . hana giggles . 
excuse me .   yes ?   i do n't have the key to that door . 
oh god .   oh god . 
he 's gone has n't he ? 
does he know a captain mcgann ? the boy hears this whispers to oliver . 
why picton ? 
he ca n't even move . 
i need morphine .   a lot .   and a pistol . 
when he dies i 'll catch up . 
the war 's over - you told me yourself . how can it be desertion ? 
what if you could n't find him  ?   sergeant not today please . not this morning . 
does he have to go ? 
i 'll tell him .   what is it ?   is it a mine ? 
he 's sleeping . 
you saved my life .   i have n't forgotten .   i thought you were very very tall . you seemed to big - a giant - and i felt like a child who ca n't keep her balance . 
since caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear so please . 
i was going to say - if you want to eat with us ever   you and lieutenant singh  
i thought that was for when we were very very old ? 
i was looking forward to this evening . 
you 've got a mustache . 
i 'd like to spend a night with you in a bed . 
sorry .   i took a benzedrine . 
i 'm going to get him i promise you . 
too late now . 
he 's on to something bigger . 
i 'm in the middle . 
i 'll send you a postcard . got to go . 
look trust me . i know what i 'm doing . 
you want to blow the whole thing go right ahead . 
i do n't know but close . 
we 're getting close . 
this was my first excuse to get away . i ca n't exactly use my cell phone . 
and a target guaranteed to catch his interest . 
i 'd need an introduction . from someone he trusts . someone who owes us a favor . 
i 've been following this guy for years . i 'm your best shot . 
it 's not the thinking of it it 's the doing it . 
we 've got to catch him in the act . 
yeah . me . 
they 've never caught him before what makes you think they 'll catch him now ? 
you 're saying the thief wants us to think it 's mac but it 's really not . 
mac 's signature . 
put the bolts on that window under a scope i 'm betting you 'll find wrench scratches on them . 
meaning no one arranges calalilies like that . he left the window open when he came in . his only mistake . 
let a thousand flowers bloom . chairman mao . 
he unscrewed the bolts reset them on rollers then slid the whole frame away . no more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor . 
entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm . 
through a window . 
i do n't recall asking your permission . 
i hardly knew the guy . why be impolite to strangers ? 
there are times when you do n't answer the phone . 
you gave them the eight billion . 
he looks familiar . 
--you're a cop . 
what about you ? 
what 's wrong . 
i 'm not leaving without you . 
no you ca n't . 
hang on . 
no way . 
the door 's the only way out ! 
we ca n't help it we ... we've got ta ... 
move it what are you waiting f ... 
we ca n't leave it in there it 's got all our accounts everything that can nail us to a goddam cross ! ! ! 
fucking thing ! ! ! 
jesus god it 's going through . 
china will think it happened before midnight . britain will swear it happened after midnight ... 
the sign of our partnership . 
i 'm leaving from the nathan road station at 6:30 tomorrow morning . you could come too . 
i 'm going to disappear . i die in a car crash in taiwan . very easy to do . 
not for me . 
that 's because you grew up rich . 
four billion dollars . 
so what are you going to do with your share ? 
nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention . 
but would you -- would you-- 
it was wrong to deceive you . 
you have something in mind ? 
ca n't break tradition . it 's bad luck . 
no . you 'll see when we get inside . 
surgically attached . 
pulse detectors . 
two men in the world do n't need passwords or codes . their retinas will scan to unlock everything . one of those two men is the chairman of the bank . 
access codes to the vault are changed daily passwords for our computer on the hour ... 
how do i look ? 
feeling old ? 
look there 's a video security system to bypass that 's the only hard part . you 've done that a dozen times . 
i 've covered everything . and you 're the best so-- 
there 's no way to practice this . and no time . besides i 've planned it all . there are n't any surprises . 
that 's the beauty of it . there 's only one tiny window of time when this will work . at the handover of hong kong -- from britain to china . the handover from them to us . 
we 're doing it tonight . 
that 's where the mask comes in . 
got it . 
the oscilloscope 's already programmed . 
sit down i 'll show you how we 're going to do it . 
nope . the cd instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded xj-6 . 
every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches . as soon as each deposit lands somewhere it 's shot somewhere else . it ends up so clean the mafia could n't find it . 
it 's taken me five years at webber insurance nights weekends every spare minute to make this cd . it has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts two or three million at a crack . total eight billion and change . 
peoples china bank . 
guest lists of every a - list party on turnover night . they 'd be handy to disappear into so we 're invited to all of them . 
the eight billion . from them to us . 
currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer . 
you 're being useless . i 'm making us rich . 
my job my rules . 
oh my god i thought-- 
do you know what you 've done ! ? do you know ? 
the mask . where is it ? 
there 's food in the fridge . i wo n't be long . 
okay look i 'm delivering this to a man who 's going to give us the key to our job . but it 's pointless to try to explain it yet . you just have to trust me . i do n't have any more secrets . 
i told you . it 's the down payment . and thanks to you it 's overdue . 
i 'll need the rembrandt now . 
i always knew you 'd do the job . 
hold the record . alone . 
my eighty your twenty smart guy-- 
okay 80 - 20 - - 
i like banks .   that 's where the money is . 
you do n't know the half of it . 
your share . 
a billion dollars . 
the big job . 
stop ! you 're making ... mistake . 
yes . yes . 
no no please god you 're wrong . i 'm a thief . just like you . 
we did it . 
shut up . 
they moved it . 
got it . 
you ca n't be too careful . 
do n't turn . i 'm counting the steps to the entrance . 
one two three ... 
it 's a party . 
in eye of that painting . 
bookshelf . sensors-- 
something like that . 
he was n't . 
my father told me not to be afraid . he 'd always be there for me . 
i had a lifeline . if i 've got a lifeline i 'm okay . 
terrified . still am . 
when i was a girl my father took me to the edge of el capitan . three thousand feet of granite . straight down . i was so scared my mouth was full of cotton . i could n't talk just stood there shivering ... like this . 
to us . to the mask . 
are n't we early ? 
i 've got something for you . 
wo n't take any time . 
no no i want to . i 'll just go into the village . 
thank you . 
you bought this for me ? 
it's --- beautiful . 
that 's it . we 're ready . 
charged . receiver ? 
got it . 
a dozen times . 
twenty four seconds -- as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve . 
i did n't mean to get personal . 
all this this is a woman 's version of what you would like . 
did i hear a car ? 
let 's do it again . 
why do n't we take oxygen ? 
oh i think you can do it . probably . 
let 's just see how we do . 
without the mask it does n't matter . 
we get the mask i 'll tell you . 
no . it 's a down payment . 
this is n't a good time to hear your personal philosophy . 
i 'll need that . 
someone was expecting that . 
it was perfect . 
you need a partner for this job . you 'll never find one as good as me . 
i drilled the bolts and went in through the window . it was the only way to bypass the smart glass . 
that 's because i wanted them to ! 
no dammit ! i mean me ! that rembrandt ... that rembrandt ! 
you do n't have any idea how lucky you are ! 
look i can help . you need a sensor expert . you 've got one . 
you do n't get the mask code unless i go . 
we 're doing this together . we 're partners . 
we go underwater ? 
they 're having a farewell party the last night . before the mask goes back to taiwan . 
in a week . 
as i recall you 've robbed it before . 
nice spot . 
and good morning . 
< u > i'm</u > dressed . 
why are we in separate -- you know separate rooms ? 
nothing ? you do n't even lock the door ? 
i 'm impressed . ca n't spot a thing . 
i 'm just curious what sort of security system you 'd have in your own house . 
what 's my problem ? you want a list ? 
i do n't believe this . 
that 's entrapment . 
where 's my bag ? 
you stole my luggage ? you-- 
those are my clothes . 
what about your bags ? 
we 're going to die are n't we ... 
it 's one way . 
you what-- ? 
what the hell was that ? 
what the hell do i do now ? 
not funny . 
he says they turned the card down . 
a film case . 
i 'm telling you it 's a forgery . the paint 's still wet for god 's sake . 
it 's a fake . 
how much am i paying ? 
fine . what do i do ? 
it 's a test . 
i 'm not here to run errands . i 'm here for the mask . 
you want me to pick up a painting ? 
not a word . 
maybe i should drive this time . 
we going somewhere ? 
it 's only on exhibit at the queen 's museum this month . even if you could get into the museum the mask bas its own security system . a special randomly programmed interval code . 
you ca n't . 
but roki said-- 
i know . 
i suspected it might be worthy of your interest . 
somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on . 
the most important piece of chinese art outside of china . 
i 'm sorry . this just means so much to me . 
well no ... but ... 
we were we are but this is perfect for you . 
i 've got something for you . 
no . why would i be ? 
you ... you ca n't . 
so alive . 
i did n't expect you to be so ... 
you 're not taking me seriously . 
i 've got something ... 
excuse me ? 
like i would have art in my suitcase . 
yes . but they do n't have a clue .   why would anyone steal my luggage ? 
i do n't care about the damned car . my luggage 's been stolen . 
that 's good . terrific . 
are you ... okay ? 
you disappeared . 
i 'll call an ambulance . 
uh yes . 
something of great value something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate ... 
i have a proposal for you . 
i do n't want to waste your time . 
i 'm sorry about the scroll but sometimes you have to lose to win . 
mr. macdougal . 
how about if i try humility . 
it 's sold . 
no you ca n't . 
uh . i 'm showing off . 
who am i ? 
tomorrow . it has to be tomorrow . or forget the mask . 
you should know when i come back here with the mask -- if anything goes wrong a detailed description of everything you 've done goes to the prc . 
we need to make the trade tomorrow . 
i 'm gon na assume that was meant as a compliment anna and just say thank you . 
what the fuck did you do with my stuff ? 
anna ?   with this real - estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me cause i 'm a little confused about how exactly we do that . 
oh hell .   i 'm dyslexic . 
that asshole smashed in my fucking neck ! 
he came tearing around the corner out of control -- 
what ?   hey -- < u > he</u > hit < u > me</u > . 
what 's your point ? 
yeah .   there 's two .   why ? 
which one ? 
any school you want . 
it 's enough -- for whatever you need for whatever your girls need for whatever your girls ' girls need -- it 'll be enough . 
five million dollars . 
and he 's making them give five million of it to you all . 
the judge came up with a number . 
well then -- if you 're feeling up to it maybe we should talk shop . 
well i was gon na head over to the browns now .   i was thinking -- mandy really values your opinion ... 
you would n't happen to have a little time right now would you donna ? 
sure you are .   you 're just a happier woman cause you do n't have to deal with maxi - pads and underwire . 
right but -- did n't you say he was paid by pg&e ? 
i know .   but the toxicologist i been talking to ?   he gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure . and everything you all have is on that list . 
it was right up on the pg&e property over there . 
seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick . 
well hell maybe that 's why you all have been so sick -- 
what 's chromium ? 
the what ? 
wow .   why would they do that ? 
they did ? 
right but -- i 'm sorry i do n't see why you were corresponding with pg&e about it in the first place . 
yeah i can see that .   i guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems are n't important but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff ? 
i 'll say .   holy moley . 
yeah i 'm real sorry to hear that . 
yeah i 'm real glad you brought that up .   i was going through your file here and i ran into these medical records .   they kinda surprised me -- 
yeah ?   i should learn to do stuff like that . they make the place feel real homey . 
this is a real nice place you got here . 
hell no .   i hate lawyers .   i just work for them .   you got a minute ? 
i 'm erin brockovich from masry & vititoe ? 
hi .   donna irving ? 
two million dollars ? 
what is that ? 
ed i swear i 'm not -- 
i was n't gon na -- 
here what comes ? 
yeah .   yours is nicer . 
careful you do n't spit from here ; you could kill someone . 
how do you know that ? 
say you 'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on earth if i did n't up and quit over all this . 
say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself . 
say you were wrong . 
oh now do n't get all jealous ed .   i got a little something for you too . 
you know what mr. potter ?   i completely forgot your birthday this year .   and seeing as how you 've been so good to me i think that is a terrible oversight .   so what i been doing over the last few days is i 've been putting together a present for you . 
no i 'm serious .   you know what kurt potter is ?   he 's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place . he 's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when pg&e offered 20 million .   he does n't work like us ed .   there 's no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing . 
fuck kurt . 
why not ? 
the fuck i 'm not .   i do n't care what the doctor says -- 
okay good .   i think i should be the one to tell 'em cause they trust me more than -- 
when ?   where ? 
fuck legal terms .   we 're talking about human beings here .   sick people .   a whole bunch of them are gon na be dead in ten years .   they need their money now !   we got ta get 'em to agree to the arbitration ed .   we got ta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to -- 
i 'm sorry are you saying that if this thing goes to trial it 'll be < u > ten years</u > before these plaintiffs see their money ? 
wait what do you mean ten years ? 
so why would pg&e offer it ? 
and if you had to guess ... 
between 50 and 400 million definitely ? 
i know .   i 'm sorry .   do i get to hear what happened anyway ? 
if you 're here to fire me your timing 's lousy . 
perks ?   jesus -- < u > perks</u > ? 
bullshit .   you stuck me in siberia dictating to some god damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me .   after all i 've done for you that 's the thanks i get . 
how dare you take that away from me . 
< u > not personal</u > ?   that 's my < u > work</u > in there ed . my sweat my labor my time .   if that 's not personal i do n't know what is . 
and what i 'm not serious ? 
kurt thought ?   what about you ?   do you think anymore ? 
bullshit .   you 'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you . 
if you tell me to relax i 'm gon na kick your fucking head off -- 
not in my world . 
why the fuck should i respect her ? 
she insulted me ! 
why good ? 
what 's a demur ? 
holy shit .   who do they represent god ? 
plus 40 percent of 20 million 's a whole lot of money . 
do you think we 'd do better by going to trial ? 
... but it wo n't cover annabelle daniels 's medical bills . 
so what are you thinking ? 
whoa .   no shit . 
what kind of things come up ? 
you might want to think real hard about the amount too .   my kids are sitting in the god damn parking lot right now cause i still do n't make enough to afford good child care . makes me think about looking around for a job where i 'm appreciated for shit 's sake . 
i want my paycheck .   by the end of the day . 
fuck you .   make time .   cause i bust my ass for you .   i watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet for you .   and what do you do for me ?   huh ?   you see the way i 'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once ?   have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work i 'm doing ?   have you ever bothered saying hey erin does n't get paid the most cause she has the best tits ; she gets paid the most cause she 's the best god damn employee i 've ever had ? 
it 's my paycheck .   which i earned .   which i deserve .   which i should n't have to beg for . that fat - ass bitch wo n't give it to me . 
yeah i mind .   you bet your ass i mind . 
i want my fucking money -- 
yeah .   yeah i 'm ... fine . 
no ed -- what with me running for my life i did n't have time to check those things -- 
i do n't know .   big .   dark . 
some guy in a truck -- he waited till i was alone then he followed me like two miles . jesus i 'm shaking .   get me a beer . 
someone 's following me . 
boy this job takes me to some of the best damn places huh ? 
d'you get his name ?   course not .   jesus ed -- 
jesus .   they look like the secret service . 
yeah i heard that one before . 
if they 've sent that little shmuck baum again i 'm gon na be real pissed off . 
well good ed .   i like working with you too . 
you did n't care about my case ? 
really ?   it makes me sick . 
jesus christ ed -- you know the more i work on this thing the more i realize what a crock of shit this legal system is .   here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town then filled it with toxic water -- and < u > we're</u > the ones who 've got ta bust our ass proving things ?   that 's just not right . 
oh they knew .   they had to know . 
what do you mean ? 
do n't give me that .   you 're gon na get plenty rich off of this mr. 40 percent .   we got those pg&e fuckers by the balls here . 
yeah ?   then gimme another raise . 
for your information frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them .   that was his job . 
i guess it was a little too inconvenient . so for fourteen years this stuff flowed into the groundwater free as you please . 
see according to this they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit could n't seep into the ground .   but guess what -- 
it did n't help but no .   the real problem 's on the bottom . 
they covered 'em over .   and not too carefully either cause you dig one inch under the surface and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock . 
they used the hex chrom here in these cooling tanks as an anti - corrosive .   then they dumped it here in these six ponds . 
< u > no</u > . 
she lived on the plume .   you never know . 
another raise would n't hurt .   and with all the time i 'm gon na be spending on the road i 'll probably be needing my own cel phone wo n't i ? 
you 're doing the right thing mr. masry . 
kinda like david and what's - his - name ? 
well -- i found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967 .   a hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then . 
four more .   eleven people .   so far . 
okay fine .   i do n't know shit about shit . but i know the difference -- 
we can get these people .   with a little effort i really think we can nail their asses to the wall . 
and this shit is bad news mr. masry .   not only does it attack every organ of the body it fucks with your dna too .   that means these people 's genes and the genes of their kids and the genes of their grandkids -- 
-- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it . 
okay so here 's what i 'll do .   i 'll go on up to ted and rita daniels -- two of the nicest people you 'd ever hope to meet who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- i 'll tell them we ca n't help them cause you do n't feel like working that hard . 
that 's crazy -- why not ? 
and i realized he 's taking a chance too . 
i 'm the one who 's injured and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gon na walk away with almost half my reward ? 
boy do i know how you feel .   first time i heard that number i said you got to be kidding me .   forty god damn percent ? 
mr. masry mario gets lost going to the bathroom .   they 'll be driving around the valley for hours . 
and you ca n't ? 
i do n't get why they 'd do that . 
at least they made an offer . 
so you think we got 'em scared ? 
so far .   but that place is a pig sty .   i would n't be surprised if there 's more . 
ten .   there 's a lot of other places i could work . 
i want a raise .   and benefits .   including dental . 
course i did . 
boy you musta really fine - tooth - combed it then huh ?   and < u > you</u > fired < u > me</u > .   jesus . 
the ones in the box of files .   the box of files ?   the one from your office ? 
it does n't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something 's wrong . 
they told her something but it ca n't have been too specific cause i talked to her and she sure did n't think her water was bad . 
you wanna know you got ta hire me back .   i got a lot of bills to pay . 
boy are you ever a shitty judge of people . 
now why in the hell would you assume that ? 
well that was nice of him .   is n't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax ? 
oh yeah ? 
what are you doing here ? 
bullshit .   you 're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed .   fuck if i 'll help you do that . 
do n't bother . 
i left a message .   i 've been dealing with that real estate thing .   i was gon na write up a whole damn report and -- 
i guess i 'm not the right kind . 
excuse me ? 
yeah .   i got it .   no problem . 
out to lunch with the girls . 
give her a cold washcloth to suck on --   i got ta go -- there 's a clean one in that bag -- i 'll check back in a bit .   sorry .   my kid -- 
i do n't wanna take your money mr. masry . 
oh .   okay .   that 's okay . 
i was wondering -- could you tell me who i 'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck ?   just -- for the weekend . 
i 'm < u > not</u > everyone else mr. masry .   i 'm someone you made promises to that you did n't deliver on .   i trusted you .   with my kids ' well - being .   now i 'm smart and i 'm hard- working and i 'll do anything .   but if you think i 'm leaving here without a job you got another thing coming . 
i do n't need pity .   i need a paycheck .   and i 've looked but when you 've spent the last six years raising babies it 's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn .   so i figure since you 're the one who said i was gon na be okay you should be the one to hire me . 
you said things would be fine and they 're not . 
there 's two things i ca n't stand mr. masry . being ignored and being lied to .   you did both . 
you never called me back .   i left messages . 
yeah ?   well fuck you .   sorry does n't feed my kids . 
< u > settle down</u > ?   i got 74 bucks to my name mr. masry !   i ca n't < u > afford</u > to settle down ! 
bullshit .   you told me i 'd get half a million dollars .   you told me i 'd be set . 
oh please it was long over by then .   god damn he made me look like some cheap -- 
open and shut ?   < u > open and fucking shut</u > ? 
... just wanna be a good mom a nice person a decent citizen .   just wanna take good care of my kids .   you know ? 
... matthew 's six katie 's four and beth 's just nine months . 
... could n't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids . 
they took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck .   i did n't have insurance so i 'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now . 
how come you did n't say anything when you found these things ? 
what do you mean ? 
and you were told to destroy those ? 
and ... ? 
did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed ? 
did he say why ? 
the fuck you do n't .   no one calls me pattee . that heavy - breathing sicko that called the other night could 've only found out about me from you .   people are dying ross .   you got document after document here right under your nose that says why and you have n't said word one about it .   i wanna know how the hell you sleep at night . 
hey ross .   tell me something .   does pg&e pay you to cover their ass or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart ? 
ross -- you are an absolute angel . 
not anymore . 
nope .   maiden . 
i wish i knew .   it 's for my boss .   he 's fighting his water bill and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places .   the easiest thing would probably be if i just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself .   would that be okay ? 
i guess i did . 
well believe it or not i am on the prowl for some water records . 
ross .   real pleased to meet you .   i 'm erin . 
thank you very much .   are n't you a gentleman ?   mr. ... 
county water board .   all righty thanks . 
hunh - uh .   what 's that ? 
well how do i find out what kind of chromium is up in hinkley ? 
so that stuff -- it kills people . 
harmful like -- how ?   what would you get ? 
there 's more than one kind ? 
what are you < u > doing</u > ?   where 's george ? 
that 's not true ; we had dinner together just last night . 
look i know you 're mad .   but the way this job is things come up at the last minute real important things and i got ta deal with them .   now i do n't like me missing dinner any more than you do but we 're all gon na have to get used to it cause the fact is it 's gon na happen sometimes . 
some kind of half - wit no - good big - haired bimbo i bet . 
oh come on where 's your sense of adventure ?   we 're going someplace you never been before . 
sweetheart you can get a whole big bunch . 
put your napkins in your laps and eat up . 
hey ros .   nice view huh ? 
hey ros where are they ? 
pg & -- are you sure ? 
what 's going on in there ? 
so did i. 
hi rosalind this is erin .   brockovich . from the file room ?   i was wondering if you could tell mr. masry that i 'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office . 
cause her own mom 's real sick too . 
yeah .   she is .   but you know what ?   that 's why i 'm helping her .   so she can get some medicine to make her feel better . 
oh god sweetheart no .   there 's nothing on earth i love more than you .   nothing .   i promise . 
i never forget honey .   i try real hard . it 's just for some reason i do n't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys i end up falling short . 
we 'll work out the roller hockey thing okay ?   whatever you want we 'll work it out . i promise . 
god damn it matthew .   what the hell are you doing out here ? 
well god damn it matthew -- randy 's mom does n't work eighteen - hour days and randy 's dad did n't leave her so figuring out who 's gon na take who where is a little easier over at randy 's house . 
we 'll see . 
thank god we got you away from her huh ? 
there 's no way a son of mine hates funky town .   it 's impossible . 
that 's all you got lady .   two wrong feet . in fucking ugly shoes .

well i 'm sure as hell not what i thought i was gon na be .   i was supposed to have one of those great lives with everything all laid- out and perfect .   i mean hell -- i was miss wichita for god 's sakes .   did i tell you that ?   you live next door to a real live beauty queen .   i still got the tiara .   i kept it cause i thought it meant something .   i thought it meant i was gon na do something great with my life .   i thought it proved i was gon na grow up to be someone . 
does n't matter .   does n't make one bit of difference .   oh god george how 'd this happen to me ? how 'd i end up so ... so < u > nothing</u > ? 
i < u > can't</u > call an exterminator .   i ca n't afford one .   god i ca n't even afford my < u > phone</u > .   i got fired . 
what kind of person lives like this ?   huh ? what kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats ? 
what are you doing here ? 
you think it could make you sick living in a place like this ? 
thanks for reminding me . 
what 're you doing ? 
this is n't gon na get you laid you know . 
you 're around every afternoon ? 
why in the hell would you want to watch my kids ? 
it 's been a while .   maybe i 'm just out of practice . 
i hope that 's not supposed to impress me . 
yeah ?   and what do you do the rest of the time live off your trust fund ? 
great .   another deadbeat . 
i 'm never here .   i got ta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat . 
yeah .   i 'm probably ruining them . 
cause i do n't even know you . 
i 'm not gon na leave my kids with you . 
i had a good neighbor george .   she was 60 and mexican and she watched my kids for free .   something tells me you 're not gon na be able to measure up to that . 
return 'em .   maybe you 'll get your money back . 
yeah .   sexy huh ?   and here 's another : five . that 's how old my other daughter is .   seven is my son 's age .   two is how many times i been married and divorced .   you getting all this ?   16 is the number of dollars in my bank account .   454 - 3943 is my phone number . and with all the other numbers i gave you i 'm guessing zero is the number of times you 're gon na call it . 
sure .   that 's one of my numbers .   it 's how many months old my little girl is . 
shit yeah .   i got numbers coming out of my ears .   like for instance ten . 
which number do you want george ? 
you want my number ? 
just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet and we 'll get along fine . 
well i 'm the neighbors .   there now we 're introduced so you can shut the fuck up . 
what the hell do you think you 're doing making all that goddamn noise ? 
a lot .   but you hang in there maybe you 'll get one . 
jaguar 's a darn pretty car . 
i 'm real sorry laura . 
that 's okay .   i understand . 
now how'm i supposed to do that when i 'm not in here most mornings and nights ? 
where 's my paycheck ? 
i am not talking to you bitch . 
what am i supposed to do check in every two seconds ? 
what 's going on ? 
i had photos of my kids plus a mug -- 
someone stole my stuff . 
i mean it 's not a problem or anything but -- i 'm just a little unclear on what those things are .   i thought maybe you 'd know . 
uh - huh ? 
i 'm surprised donna did n't say anything . 
it sure could yeah .   thanks a lot . 
yeah .   who are you ? 
wow that 's soon -- 
you 're moving away ?   when ? 
it 'll be fine yeah . 
hi sweetie .   were you a good girl ?   where are matt and katie ? 
do n't go telling anyone .   it 'll ruin my reputation . 
uh - huh .   spent the last few days knocking on doors .   and you know what ?   they 're not .   i mean they got problems but none of this cancer stuff .   and their pets are fine .   so i do n't know -- i just ca n't shake the feeling that it was n't no multivitamin they put in the water . 
... and when i realized our area 's just as bad as hinkley i thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too .   so i went and asked . 
their parents i 'm pretty sure . 
right i guess those are the kids -- 
no one put me up to anything .   i was just hoping i could ask you a couple questions . 
who 's baxter ? 
hi i 'm erin brockovich .   i was just over in the library there asking a mess of questions about -- i guess they call it epidemiology ? -- and the fella there told me to find you cause you know all about it . 
dr. paulsen ? 
oh my god .   oh my god . 
and get someone to help around the house . 
i can put them in a good school . 
i do n't even know how much money that is . 
five million dollars ? 
oh my god . 
a number for the whole group or for us ? 
it 's a good day .   i feel good . 
for what ? 
sure wish i had longer to get used to the idea .   you think if you got no uterus and no breasts you 're still technically a woman ? 
no .   hunh - uh see that 's not what the doctor said .   he said one 's got absolutely nothing to do with the other . 
well -- then it 's got ta be a different than what 's in our water cause ours is okay . the guys from pg&e told me .   they sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine . 
and you say this stuff this hexavalent chromium -- it 's poisonous ? 
an on - site monitoring well ?   that means -- 
not around here .   this is a rough part of the world .   hard times not a lot of money not a lot of luck .   it 's a challenge staying healthy in a town like this .   heck even our dogs up and die . 
i thought the same thing right off the bat . that 's why we went to see the doctor .   but hunh - uh .   turns out one 's got nothing to do with the other . 
it 's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there . 
the chromium .   well that 's what kicked this whole thing off . 
cause of the chromium . 
you bet .   paid for a check - up for the whole family .   and not like with insurance where you pay then wait a year to be reimbursed either .   they just took care of it .   just like that .   we never even saw a bill . 
well they paid for the doctor 's visit . 
are you kidding ?   with how our lives are if i start subdividing files i 'll be sunk .   i just kept all pg&e correspondence in one place . 
so the whole idea of selling the house -- do n't get me wrong i 'd be glad to move to some better place but if they are n't gon na pay us properly i just do n't see the point . 
thank you .   it 's in remission now thank the lord but you never know .   and then while that 's going on i end up having to have a hysterectomy .   plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts .   all benign so far but still no matter how positive you stay an operation can still take it out of you . 
i know .   they 're more than a bit unusual . see two years ago pete got hodgkin 's disease .   that 's a kind of cancer -- 
cause first you got ta move then there 's decorating and if the windows are n't the same size you know -- you 're making all new curtains .   honest to god i do n't know if i have the energy .   you know i 've been sick . me and peter both have . 
thank you .   i think so too .   that 's why i 'm being such a stickler on this house price thing .   i do n't mean to be a pain in pg&e 's backside especially after all they 've done for hinkley but i look around here and i think if they want this place they 're gon na have to pay for it .   and i do n't just mean pay for the house ; i 'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over . 
i added air conditioning put in the pool made all those pillows by hand ... 
well it oughta be with all the work i put into it . 
you 're a lawyer ? 
okay chewie it 's now or never . 
chewie head for the bottom of the city . 
... the power ? 
i do n't care .   it would 've been worth it .... for han . 
we should have stayed and finished them off . 
what happened ? 
... i love you .   i could n't tell you before but it 's true . 
i 'm worried about all of us .   i ca n't figure out what they 're up to . 
no thanks . 
chewie do you think you can repair him ? 
something 's wrong here .   your friend lando is very charming but i do n't trust him . 
i hope luke made it to the fleet all right . 
has threepio turned up yet ? 
you look silly . 
what are you staring at ? 
i do n't like this . 
you do have your moments ... not many but you do have them . 
can you trust him ? 
a mining colony . 
never heard of that system . 
you keep logs ?   my how organized . 
that depends .   where are we ? 
not bad hot shot not bad .   then what ? 
what 'd you have in mind for your next move ? 
i 'm still not sure what you 've accomplished . 
you could have warned him before you shut him off . 
you 're going to attack them ? ! ! ! 
no lightspeed ? 
the entrance is collapsing ! 
but the tremors have stopped . 
those star destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed .   you ca n't make the jump in this asteroid field . 
looks like some kind of mynock . 
are you crazy ! 
outside in the cave . 
there 's something out there ! 
i do not ! 
there 's nothing dull about a man i can depend on to be civilized . 
do n't count on it .   i happen to like nice men . 
afraid of ?   certainly not you captain solo ... or any other man in this galaxy . 
stop that . 
sometimes maybe ... occasionally when you are n't acting like a scoundrel . 
yes you do . 
would you please stop calling me that ? 
where have i heard that before ? 
they 're moving away . 
felt like a hydro concussion ... an imperial cruiser . 
i do n't expect anything except to be left alone . 
sorry captain being held by you is n't enough to get me excited . 
how do i look ? 
very funny .   you can let go now .... i 'm getting angry . 
what is it ? 
now you 're making sense . 
i 'm against that . 
i take it back . 
to get killed ... you 're not seriously going into an asteroid field ? 
probably an asteroid field .... 
or you ran into something .... 
i 'm glad you said there was going to be no problem or i 'd be worried . 
i 'll be surprised if we ever start moving . 
this bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade . 
would it help if i got out and pushed ? 
wait do n't open it ... that 's one of the traps for the ice creatures . 
why you low - down stuck - up half- witted scruffy - looking nerf - herder . 
you must have gone completely out of your feeble mind . 
i do n't know what he 's talking about . 
i had nothing to do with it .   general rieekan thinks it 's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from . 
an imperial probe droid . 
what was it ? 
now all we 've got to worry about is what attacked him . 
those creatures he keeps talking about ... we 'd better double the security ... han i do n't know how ... 
and you think you 're the one to apply some heat ? 
we are fighting for a cause much ... 
i 'd just as soon kiss a wookiee . 
i respect you .   you 're a bold fighter maybe not the brightest but ... han no your worship .. that 's not what i 'm talking about . 
and what are they pray tell ? 
me ?   i do n't know what you mean . 
han we need you here . 
does luke know ? 
you said you were going to stay . what happened ? 
that sounds familiar . 
are the coordinates set ? 
it 's luke .   get under him .   slow down .   easy chewie .   line up your tracking system .   lando open the hatch . 
no argument just do it .   that 's a command ! 
luke needs help .   we must go back . 
what 'd you say ? 
we 've got to find luke . 
you 'd better know what you 're doing or this is going to get very messy . 
what chance have we got in here ? what are we going to do when they cut ... 
you 've probably never done an honorable thing in your life . 
chewie 's right .   we must try to save han . 
we have no use for your kind . 
and when do you betray us again ? 
what 's going on ? 
... we 're the bait . 
what about han ? 
it 's a lovely outpost . 
you 're part of the mining guild then ? 
not really . 
you may call me leia . 
two transports at a time is awfully risky . 
what is it ? 
have they analyzed the one that was killed ? 
is there any chance of them surviving out there ? 
i understand . 
let 's go . 
i thought you knew this person . 
well what now ? 
what ? ? 
a tremor ! 
closer ? ! 
you do n't have to do this to impress me . 
i 'll be back later . 
you rest now . 
this hyperdrive had better work . 
lando is he alright ? ... lando ? are you there ?   how 's luke ? 
luke no !   it 's a trap . 
i could get more loyalty if i went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures . 
he wants to pay off that criminal he 's in hock to . 
first han now you .   when am i going to learn not to count on anyone but myself ? ... 
that 's just great .   why does n't everyone just take off ? 
where are you going ? 
what did you say ? ! 
me too .   i was afraid . 
the bacta are growing well .   the scars should be gone in a day or so .   does it still hurt ? 
what honey ? 
well why are they tearing the building down ? 
c'm on i can read for christ sake . 
burke take a look at this damn thing it just does n't make sense . 
you 're telling me that i should take my daughter to a witch doctor ? is that it ? 
you 're sorry . christ eighty - eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit ... 
and i do n't care what you call it ! i 'm not putting her away ! 
look i 'm telling you again and you 'd better believe it i 'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum ! 
sure you wo n't change your mind ? 
i 'm gon na miss you .

oh . what are you talking about for christ sake ! did you see her or not ? she 's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or ... 
what was going on in there how could she jump off the bed like that ? 
hey do me a favour will ya ' . tell me something good . 
look doc i really do n't understand how her whole personality could change . 
so what causes this ? 
oh no that was no spasm . i got on the bed the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking . the whole thing with me on it ! 
yeah i guess . maybe not . you do n't think a psychiatrist- ? 
she used those words ? 
hey come on i 'm grown - up . what 'd she say ? i mean specifically doctor . 
well what for example ? i mean give me a for instance ! 
you 're kidding ! like what ? 
wait a minute . what are you talking about ? 
ya know those things to get attention like saying that her bed shakes and stuff . 
and those lies she 's been telling ? 
do you think i should take her to see a psychiatrist ? 
stimulant ? she 's higher than a kite right now ! 
what is it ? a tranquilizer ? 
why the math ? 
is she gon na die ? 
yes . he 's already here .

if a person was possessed by a demon of some kind how do you go about getting an exorcism ? 
and how do you go about getting an exorcism ?

soap convention . 
you know i saw you guys once . you and frank .   at the roosevelt . 
like diamonds huh ?   i never get over it . when i was a little girl my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish . like i could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into - a necklace for myself .   she 'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes i do n't know it was like she really believed it .

guess they 're up . 
did you break a cup jack ? 
damn right . 
i started wondering -- if you could n't switch back -- would it make a difference ? 
no life signs at all . he 's a turnip . 
jon if i 'm not there he will be tipped off .   i 'll get rid of jamie -- but you and i are in this together . 
ca n't we call someone ? admiral lazarro ? 
jon what is it ? 
-- or maybe all at once .   there 's a get - together tonight at new st. marks . for all the bureau chiefs and their families .   he 's insisted jamie and i be there too . 
what do you mean ? 
he freaked out when he thought i had seen this stuff .   i think it 's a list of cities -- santiago ho chi minh city nandi ... 
christ jon !   how could you do this to yourself ? how could you do this to us ?   do you know -- do you know what he did to me ... ? 
tell me what happened on april 9th -- 13 years ago . 
i do n't know that .   maybe jon 's already dead . 
i took it from my fake husband . 
how did he expect to do that ? 
i know you -- you 're the one who called .   you 're castor troy .   you killed my son -- 
whoever you are do n't call again . 
okay you 're having an emotional crisis .   you need to seek the help of a trained -- 
who is this ? 
is someone there ? 
you want me to tell you it 's okay to leave ?   okay go on !   go ! 
you said you 'd be here ! you promised me -- you promised jamie !   what could be more important than that ? 
what are you saying ?   oh god -- you 're going on assignment again ... 
and you would n't be . 
i do n't know ...   maybe because you 've never needed my help . 
totally -- you were being very very bad .   you went up in the plane and jumped out .   you had a parachute but it did n't open . 
actually -- in this dream -- i was your mother . 
we were back in high school . you wanted to join the sky diving team but i would n't let you . 
... i was dreaming ... 
so is finishing my residency and passing my boards ... 
i 'm late for surgery . 
jon ... we just remember how it used to be .   you staying for a while or is this just a piss - stop ? 
well you tried .   you failed miserably but you tried . 
wait a second -- you hated madonna .   did n't you ? 
remember this from our junior prom ?   boy were you ever mad for madonna . 
i 'm going to the powder room . 
good .   because i 'm fed up . 
that 's what i 'd like to know .   she stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off . 
-- yes . 
-- studying . 
yes jon .   that karl . 
great ?   he 's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him . 
i think jamie 's been seeing karl again . 
the world can wait jon . you 're going . 
jon it 's the tenth .   i know how difficult it is for you but we still have to go . 
you 're wearing your suit -- 
... that 's great . 
-- what ? 
you always say that -- then you leave . 
is n't that what all this is about ?   letting jamie go out cooking me dinner -- your next assignment ? 
so -- how long will you be gone this time ? 
you would n't even sip champagne at our wedding . we were underage -- you would n't break the law .   remember what my brother called you ? 
i think -- you 're trying to get me drunk . 
why do i feel like i 'm on a blind date ? 
-- i 've got to study . 
what is with you tonight ? 
jon -- i do n't have time to play games .   there 're leftovers in the fridge . 
the hospital . 
as much as ever .   nothing . 
im not worried mom . hes still learning our ways ... 
mary janes mom .   you promised . 
mom dont you think we need to open the presents ? 
rise ... and ... shine ... ! 
is it morning yet ? 
ringing my bell ... 
mary had a little lamb . 
thats good but ... you did forget the anniversary . 
mom liked it . 
one year he had a solar system named after her ... 
not bad ... i shoulda warned you .   dad always does something really special for their anniversary . 
thats where you work . 
big eds . 
try not to be late because kids dont like to be the last one picked up . 
i have winter camp until four then ballet until five thirty . 
this is day care .   its where babies go when their parents are at work . 
you promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains ? 
you know how to make chocolate milk ? 
do you like kids ? 
the aliens ... in the mother ship .   you look just like him . 
they did a pretty good job . 
wheres my real dad ? 
fightings a part of it annie .   you know that right ? 
thats right .   okay lets make a quick stop at the kids shoe department pick up my watch from the battery place then ill run into the linen store ... 
were almost done here ... 
mommy needs five more minutes in la la land . that could be her present ... 
youre jumping sweetheart ... 
dont do this jack ... but he continues ... 
what do you want from me ? you want me to tell you everything that happened was okay ? 
jesus jack ... 
no jack i never got married . you ? 
not with what they pay me ... 
thats the one ... 
uh huh . to paris . my firm has an office there and im going to be heading it up . 
im moving to paris ... it was right here ...   its a box marked jack.   i put it in the stack for the salvation army ... 
dont worry about it jack ... 
its good to see you ... 
jack ... god its been so long ... you look ... 
i promise . come to bed honey . 
i promise jack ... 
are you okay jack ? 
youve been jack campbell .   and thats always a good thing ... 
its been interesting thats for sure . 
dont do that ... 
then get a goddamn snow blower ! 
i cant believe you want to move back into the city .   i thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here ? 
jack what could you possibly be thinking ? what about my job ? 
annie goes to a great school . 
are you out of your mind ? 
what are you talking about jack ? 
a perk for what ? 
for the week ? 
so whats the big surprise ? you didnt rent this place for the weekend did you ? 
its like a museum . 
i could stay here forever ... 
thats all i wanted to hear ... 
i already told you you were gon na get lucky jack ... 
way out ... 
i dont know how you did it hoss but you pulled it off . 
you know champagne makes me do crazy things . 
what are you sure about ? 
imagine having a life where everything was easy ... where you asked for things and people just brought them to you ... 
god sometimes i think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a cd player ... 
i mean yes i help people that need it ... 
my office is a dump i answer my own phone ... and youve seen my pay check . 
cmon jack you think there arent mornings when i wake up and wonder what the hell im doing in new jersey ... 
i think its good to be a little unsure about who you are .   its very human . 
and now ... ? 
worse you mean ... 
now im worried ... just say it .   whatever it is well deal with it . 
you are so not off the hook yet slick . 
how do you even know about this place ? 
jack ... can we afford all this ? 
you actually forgot our anniversary . 
what are you talking about ?   you never wait all day .   you can barely wait until its light out . 
enjoy it sweetheart ... 
i found it at an outlet store .   i know its a knock - off but i think itll look great on you ... 
no open it ... 
nice jack .   youre sweeping me off my feet . 
then say it ... just say it to me ... ! 
cmon you know what i like to hear ... 
say it jack ... 
its good right ? 
you want the cake ! ? 
sorry jack .   its too important to me . 
you mean this chocolate cake ? 
how was the game honey ? 
if you want to look at it that way ... 
jack stop that . i 'm still mad at you ...   ... who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store . 
the trek out to the hospital every day didnt help either ...   you were great . surviving the heart attack was one thing ... 
you cant really raise a kid in an apartment in the village ... 
we were young ...   remember that little place on charles street we used to go to ? 
good jack .   maybe well keep her . 
i think it worked out okay dont you ? 
well ... annie for one . 
maybe youre not .   the jack campbell i married wouldnt need a $ 2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life but if thats what its gon na take then buy it . just buy the goddamn suit ... we can take the money out of the kids college fund . 
its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you jack . 
excuse me ? 
those shoes were twenty five dollars .   cmon take it off .   well go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like . 
$ 2400 ? !   are you out of your mind ? 
i mean ... wow ... off the charts great . 
look at me like you havent seen me every day for the last twelve years ... 
how can you do that ? 
this is good stuff jack keep it coming ... 
thanks jack ... 
its ten thirty jack . by eleven youre gon na be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off . we dont have time for wining and dining . 
that is the general idea yes ... 
i thought we had a deal about you watching cnbc in bed . 
jack .   i said the kids are asleep ... 
and ... ? 
... my feet are hurtin ... 
youre having a bad day ill go with you ... actually theres no way in hell youre gettin me back out there ... 
fine shes the kids dog .   lets go wake josh see if he wants to walk her . 
shes your dog jack . 
here you go ... 
uh huh ... 
funny jack .   im laughing on the inside . 
because youll be here . 
telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids . 
you look forward to this party all year .   whats with you today ? 
look we dont have time for this right now well talk about it later .   now get dressed ...   youre not wearing that to the thompsons party . i dont care how hilarious you think it is ... 
jack ... dont even start ... 
the city ?   new york city ?   why ? 
where were you ? 
what kind of man does that ! ? 
are you okay ? 
i ca n't seem to let go of you ... 
we 're being responsible .   go . get on the plane . 
go . im sorry you should just go ... 
right for us . but ... im afraid that if you get on that plane ... 
believe me i know what an incredible opportunity this is for you ... 
dont   go jack ... 
i know weve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to london is the right thing to do . but in my heart ... this feels wrong . 
i have a bad feeling about this . 
i also put side two of london calling on there ... 
every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way ... 
i found it ! 
you didnt seem to mind offering to help me on christmas day when you were unwrapping that prada bag i gave you . 
hey kind of under a little pressure here . 
< u > where is reed</u > ? 
no it 's not .   i thought i was done waiting for reed ... we 're all in this together now ben . 
just give reed a little more time . you know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one -- 
he did n't mean it .   you know johnny . he 's always been a hothead -- 
< u > what</u > did he do to the uniform ? ! 
he did n't . 
the suit will stretch .   you should try it -- 
we need to give you a physical so we know what got zapped . 
i can only stay for one drink ben . i 've got to meet with victor . 
we can monitor the cloud 's approach and observe the tests from here . 
victor did . 
i 'll schedule the launch .   call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew . 
but johnny ... you < u > can't fly</u > . 
what are you doing -- 
no < u > i'm</u > sorry for pushing you out . 
as soon as you stop < u > acting</u > like one . come on you 're < u > smarter</u > than this . you think those people out there < u > care</u > about you ?   you 're just a < u > fad</u > to them . 
johnny slow down .   < u > think</u > .   you know mom did n't raise us to -- 
johnny ?   did you see ben ? 
you two need a time - out . 
i 'm driving . 
< u > girl</u > ... ? ! 
that 's the temperature of the < u > sun</u > . 
you were at 4000 kelvin .   any hotter you 're approaching supernova -- 
grow up johnny .   you want to run around < u > on fire</u > for the rest of your life ? 
i think that thing is ben . 
stop it . 
apparently i can disappear . 
the synthetics act as a second skin adapting to your individual needs to -- 
a < u > gasket</u > ?   reed we 're at a party . 
i 'm sure i can come up with something . 
you < u > need</u > a doctor . 
reed stop you need to rest your -- 
that would have kinda defeated the purpose .   and reed ...   i 'm saying it now . 
when i walked out i waited < u > ten</u > < u > minutes</u > outside your door .   ten . waiting for you to come find me . 
i did .   i did reed ... but i wanted < u > you</u > to be that man . 
i gave him twenty . 
of course i was .   i 'd read all your papers on bioethics .   some of them two times just so i 'd have something to say to you . 
remember our first date here ... ?   god i was so nervous . 
reed .   shh .   just be quiet .   and look up . 
every variable but < u > yourself</u > .   you do n't eat sleep .   you ca n't live in your head like -- 
better than your < u > life</u > .   victor 's not the one who has to get into that thing .   < u > we</u > are . 
do n't let victor push you into making a mistake -- 
reed .   how close are we to a cure ? 
and you sure you can control this thing ?   last time did n't work out so well . 
but < u > we're</u > the focus right reed ? < u > reed</u > ... ? 
and reverse the mutations -- 
what are you doing ? 
no .   there were n't .   there was < u > you</u > . and < u > me</u > .   no variables no math .   it was actually the simplest thing in the world .   but your head got in the way ... like it always does . 
i just wanted to share an apartment . what was so complicated about that ? 
reed .   i was ready for the next step you were n't ergo i walked . 
are you kidding ? 
i 'm sorry i 'm sorry i did n't mean to do that ... you must think that was some kind of latent hostility or -- 
i 'm sure i can come up with something . 
anger .   rage .   frustration . 
excuse me ? 
what about you ?   you have n't eaten in days .   how come you 're never on this side of the microscope ? 
if it happened to him then it could ... 
how come ben ca n't turn it on and off like us ? 
what ... ?   < u > oh</u > . 
it has to be the cloud .   it 's fundamentally altered our dna . 
what ?   what do you mean you -- 
you are such a dork reed ... you never got it and never will unless it 's explained to you in quantum physics . 
which was ? 
you 're < u > happy</u > for me and victor . 
you always had a way with words .   i should be getting back . 
yes thanks . 
great minds think alike . 
well he 's welcome to ride shotgun but we already have a pilot on our payroll .   you remember my brother johnny ... 
it 's been changed . 
right .   that 's exactly what i meant . 
i was talking about us .   working together . 
never better . 
victor we < u > can't do anything</u > until the research is ready . 
please do n't make this personal -- 
if these molecules are n't stable they could make us < u > worse</u > maybe even kill us . 
he 's working round the clock .   but the data needs to be tested analyzed before -- 
victor wait slow down a second .   i want you to know i appreciate everything you 've done for me but i just do n't -- 
you said it was urgent . 
i 'm sorry i did n't get a chance to -- 
victor your scar -- 
victor i 'm sorry i -- 
victor are you feeling alright ? 
you ca n't leave them out there . 
what are you doing ? 
uh victor i hope i have n't done something to make you think ... 
it 's been a good two years victor ... the company 's accomplished so much . 
i understand the < i > business</i > reasons . 
it 's just business . 
would n't it be quicker if we all helped ? 
you 're going out there ? with those antibodies -- 
we must ! 
but we just ca n't leave him in there ! what 'll happen to him ? 
i ca n't imagine how it possibly could have come loose . i distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts -- 
listen ... the heart . 
he certainly is . he should be up and about in no time . 
i do n't know yet doctor . and i wo n't know until i test it . 
air bubbles ! ... doctor -- 
doctor ... you ca n't mean that ! not when we 've come this far . and if we give up there 'll be no way of saving mr. benes -- 
but big enough for us ... 
they 're much smaller than bacteria ... 
i just wanted to thank you for taking me along . 
i -- i want to say ... 
look ! they follow the direction of her glance are startled to see : 
what do you mean ? 
oh no . plenty of cause . he wo n't follow the herd or change his convictions -- even when they 're not popular . and he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days there 's nothing more suspicious than that . 
you 're not the first but he 's much too innocent much too involved with his work to realize what 's going on around him . 
that 's why you 're really here . i knew it from the start . 
keeping an eye on dr. duval ... 
a great deal more than that i believe ... 
thank you for saving my life . 
i feel much better now ... 
open it ! open it before they get here ! 
oh yes i 'm sure dr. duval could . if we had the parts . 
no it requires such absolute precision -- 
not anything built into the chassis .   if it had n't come loose -- 
you ca n't --it 's too dangerous -- 
should n't you answer that ? 
i have no idea . 
but i did . i 'm positive ! 
doctor -- is it possible ? that we 're seeing it happen before our eyes ? 
and if it should take more time to get through -- 
i never ... never imagined it could be anything ... like this . 
not working for someone like dr. duval -- 
i 've been with him since i got out of school . he brought me into the cmdf over five years ago . 
not in the hands of a great surgeon like dr. duval . the beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter . 
that 'll teach you where to keep your hand . 
you may learn to like it . 
i think it 's the most exciting --   we 're going to see things no one ever saw before . the actual physical process of life itself -- not something under a microscope ... just think of it -- 
you sound as if you 're not looking forward to it . 
we 're pushing oxygen today . 
well okay - thank you detective . 
oh no i ca n't let you do that . 
where 'd you get him that parka ? 
oh he 's adorable . 
oh now he 's adorable .

so how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently ? 
okay are you sure cause i mean how do you know ?   because see the crime i 'm investigating the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates . and they called someone who works here so it 'd be quite a coincidence if they were n't ya know connected . 
yah it 's this vehicle i asked you about yesterday . i was just wondering - 
i unnerstand . i 'll keep it real short then . i 'm on my way out of town but i was just - do you mind if i sit down ? i 'm carrying a bit of a load here .

well you can help me . my name 's marge gunderson - 
... you 're the owner here mr. lundegaard ? 
huh ? do you mind if i sit down - i 'm carrying quite a load here . 
i wonder if i could take just a minute of your time here -

how we doin' on that vehicle ?

now i saw some rough stuff on your priors but nothing in the nature of a homicide ... 
well associating with criminals if you 're the one they talked to that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in stillwater . 
... now i know you 've had some problems struggling with the narcotics some other entanglements currently on parole - 
well mr. proudfoot this call came in past three in the morning .   it 's just hard for me to believe you ca n't remember anyone calling .

leave me alone !   i do n't ever want to see you again ! 
let go of me ! 
what ? !   you 're sorry ?   i do n't believe that for a minute . 
there 's a part of you i really like but i ca n't do this anymore .   i just ca n't .   this is killing me ... 
no no shut up !   i 've had enough . i tried tyler ... i have tried ... 
you are an insane person . 
whatever .   i 'll take my food to go ... 
two sides ?   you 're dr. jeckle and mr. jackass . 
you got about thirty seconds . 
then i 'll have the clam chowder ... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie . 
i 've done you enough favors . 
sixty seconds then i 'm out of here . 
i do n't want to hear anything you 've got to say . 
here comes an avalanche of bullshit . 
the were burning their fingertips with lye .   the stink was unbelievable . 
your whacked - out bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom .   i thought they were going to break my arm . 
tyler durden !   tyler durden you fucking freak .   what 's going on ?   i 'm coming over there ... 
what ... ? 
what is wrong with you ? 
you fuck me then snub me .   you love me you hate me .   you show me your sensitive side then you turn into a total asshole !   is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship tyler ? 
is that what you 're calling it ? 
you mean you want to know if i think we were just having sex or making love ? 
is this a trick ? 
what kind of stupid question is that ? ! 
can i come in ? 
you 're afraid to say . 
why would you get bent if i asked ? 
guy or girl ? 
what is this ?   who did this ? 
that day you came over to my place to play doctor ... what was going on there ? 
have we been talking too long ?   must we change the subject ? 
hear what ? 
what do you get out of it ? 
it was the smart move on her part . 
do you care ? 
chloe 's dead . 
well ... thanks anyway . 
i could check your prostate . 
i wish i could return the favor . 
well that 's a relief .   thank you . 
you feel nothing ? 
make sure . 
feel anything ? 
tragically they 're dead .   i 'm alive and i 'm in poverty .   you want any ? 
would you do something for me ?   i need you to check and see if there 's a lump in my breast .   i ca n't afford to throw money away on a doctor . 
you 're such a nutcase i ca n't even begin to keep up . 
do n't worry i 'm leaving . 
like sex crime victims underwear inside - out bound with electrical tape . 
i got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar . 
what ... ? 
do you want to wait to hear me describe death ? 
this is n't a for - real suicide thing . this is probably one of those cry - for- help things . 
me too .   i got a stomach full of xanax .   i took what was left of a bottle .   might 've been too much . 
i 've been going to debtor 's anonymous .   you want to see some truly fucked up people ? 
like testicular cancer ? 
you have n't been going to yours . 
the forwarding number .   i have n't seen you at any support groups . 
where have you been the last few weeks ? 
i suppose . 
should we ? 
looks like this is goodbye . 
that 's your favorite too ?   tried to slip it by me eh ? 
so we each have three -- that 's six . what about the seventh day ?   i want ascending bowel cancer . 
so far you have four and i only have two ! 
i want that . 
i want brain parasites . 
i 'll take the parasites . 
i do n't know -- am i ? 
well technically i have more of a right to be there than you .   you still have your balls . 
you take tuberculosis .   my smoking does n't go over at all . 
candy - stripe a cancer ward .   it 's not my problem . 
-- instead of just waiting for their turn to speak . 
a year ?   how 'd you manage that ? 
it 's cheaper than a movie and there 's free coffee . 
go ahead .   i 'll expose you . 
and i saw you practicing this ... 
i have to save eugene ! 
what did you see ? 
speed up . 
another premonition ? 
what did you see ?   what am i looking for ? 
i do n't think so .   alex 's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it . 
six duds in a row . 
are you crazy ?   what makes you think you 'd survive ? 
what are you doing ?   you 're going to kill us ! 
how you doing in there hero ? 
so let 's do it . 
please what else could it mean ? 
then it was n't just a sign . it was a premonition ? 
you were there ? 
you have to tell us now . 
i hope you 're ready for this . 
i did n't beat it ; i hid from it . if you were smart you 'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog because what little life you have left is over as you know it .   do n't make new friends do n't fall in love and do n't ever bother trying to save others .   that 's the worst killer of them all . 
that 's what alex used to ask himself right up until ... 
if you have the same power as alex you 'll be seeing signs soon .   when you see anything creepy or ominous an in - your - face irony kinda thing ? do n't ignore it .   it usually means the difference between life and death . 
that 's good .   get all your tears out now you 'll need your eyes .   for the signs . 
congratufuckinglations .   that makes you last to go .   but do n't worry once the others are dead it 'll come back for you .   always does . 
the survivors of flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash . that was death 's original design . 
death 's list .   the precise order you 're going to die in . 
well if you put them on the list they 're already tits up . 
nice work .   maybe if you 're real lucky you 'll wind up in here with me .   but i doubt you 'll survive that long . 
yeah how ? 
kimberly burroughs eh ?   what do you want ? 
she had the baby ? 
a guard grabbed me before i could find eugene . 
if only alex and i had done that with the others alex might still be ... 
we need to hurry . 
make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight . 
he probably already knows we 're coming . 
a mortician .   he seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us . 
that 's why death is working backwards . it 's tying up all the loose ends sealing the rift once and for all this chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie . in order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay it has not been edited . 
being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in death 's design . 
your entire world view just went out the window .   i could n't expect a religious conversation overnight . we 'll get through this .   i promise . 
random sure . 
what about you kimberly ?   did you anyone from flight- ? 
what about the rest of you ?   kimberly you were driving to daytona .   was route 18 your first choice ? 
the only reason he was on route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings . 
no !   it ca n't be . 
i was dead .   and came back to life . an eeg machine .   where 's eugene ? 
yeah fuck 'em .   no offense . 
what do you want me to do ? 
yes .   i was in a hospital .   there was screaming ... a nurse was choking me .   i could n't tell what she looked like but the name tag was right in my face .   kalarjian . 
no it 's not here .   this one was different .   more like the pile up and the van going into the lake . 
this makes no sense .   isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake .   could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested ? 
and when it was rory 's turn to die and thomas was in the way ? 
what happened when eugene tried to kill himself out of turn ? 
no .   if anyone dies from a crash now it 'll be me .   but i ca n't die if eugene and isabella are still alive .   i 'm last on death 's list . 
what about that ? 
so if you give us the pregnant lady 's number we can warn her about the lake and she 'll live long enough to have the baby . 
i can practically taste the water in my throat .   and something else .   the smell of flowers ... 
i was driving a white van .   it must 've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and i drowned .   it was ... horrible . 
i ... i ... 
the second one just dies .   a 16 year old kid . 
how can you say that ?   what kind of monster are you ? 
the songs on the radio .   but wait .   i do n't understand .   why is this even happening to me ? 
that still does n't make sense .   you said you die in the same order you were originally meant to .   but evan shaeffer died last in my premonition not first . 
officer burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends . 
exact order ?   then i 'm next !   i was meant to die with my friends so i 'm next ! 
what list ? 
it 's not just about me .   someone i saved died last night in a freak accident .   what if the others are in danger too ? 
i had a premonition about the route 18 pile up ... i saved some people . and now i think death is after me . 
i thought ... i thought you might be able to help me . 
for god 's sake leave him alone dad . 
welcome back .   we did it .   for real . 
you ca n't cheat destiny .   i know what i have to do to save us .   i have to die . 
i 'm not sure ... i do n't think isabella was ever destined to die in the pile- up . 
i don't ... what if i made a mistake ? 
i know how it feels to be dead . 
should n't we pull over ? 
i think a nurse named kalarjian is going to choke isabella to death ! 
do n't worry .   nothing can happen to us . 
he ca n't breathe damn it .   i think his lung 's collapsed ! 
how do you know ? 
are you thinking what i 'm thinking ? 
how are we going to find her ?   there must be thousands of white vans in this state . 
it throws the entire death list out of whack .   and a new list has to be rewritten from scratch .   we all start over with a clean slate . 
yeah i thought he was supposed to be helpful . 
this is cheery . 
we have to tell her she 's in danger ! 
turn around .   the cleaning woman said they 're at the dentist 's . 14th and main . 
they 're next on the list .   we have to find them . 
pigeons ... it 's a sign !   if clear 's right about the order then nora and tim are going to be attacked by pigeons ! 
clean up ?   i do n't ... 
then you believe all this ? ?   that death is working off a list ? 
evan shaeffer 's dead . 
... my premonition was just like his . 
the log truck ... and everybody i guess . everyone was driving like a maniac . and somehow i knew something horrible was going to happen even before it did . 
like i said it was like i was there . i remember everything .   the sounds of the crashes the smells the look on shaina 's face ... 
you 're not listening to me !   you have to do something ! 
that 's the truck that 's going to kill everyone ! 
there 's going to be a pile up .   logs . bodies everywhere .   i saw it happen . it happened . 
highway to hell highway to hell . 
there 's going to be a huge accident ! everyone 's gon na die all of us i saw it ! 
there 's going to be a huge accident ! everyone 's gon na die .   all of us !   i saw it ! 
what 's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to daytona ? 
i can live with thaaaa -- 
this trip better be worth it . what 's the guy - girl ratio again ? 
no i 'm good . 
i guess so . 
i ... i do n't know . 
i do n't know what 's weirder the dialing a wrong number part or that death would set you up nine months in advance . 
more than that .   all the songs on the radio were about car crashes . some kid 's banging toy cars together .   she was dialing her cell phone with her headset on .   his car was leaking oil all over the road . 
i used to have those feelings too . but that 's when i 'd think of mom . her strength ... and courage .   and i 'd pray that maybe i 'd grow up to be as brave as she was .   and the bad thoughts would go away . 
i love you too dad .   goodnight . 
that it 's not over yet . 
i know it 's crazy but i 'm really scared for the others .   i 've got this terrible feeling . 
i will dad .   bye luv you . 
you got it dad .   i 'll call you if i have a problem . 
hey dad .   what 's up ? 
i know dad . 
i know this is the first time we 've been apart since .   but everything 's gon na be okay . 
relax dad .   it 's daytona not mongolia . 
thanks dad .   i 'll call you . 
no ! no ! do n't ! 
police are coming . 
get out ! get out of the car ! 
carter get out ! 
ca n't you open the door ? ! 
stop the car ! 
billy told the f.b.i. he saw you runnin ' away from her house . 
we 're takin ' you to a cabin in the woods it 's only a couple miles from my house .   keep off the highways they 'll be lookin ' for us . 
nothing is ... anymore . 
those guys are probably fifteen minutes away . 
most kids never have it happen . 
alex on the plane ... you must have experienced ... some kind of hyper awareness . but here ... you 're suggesting tod 's death ... and maybe our own ... will happen because of ... an active presence . 
i do n't understand ... did you see tod die ? did it happen again like on the plane ? 
that 's total bullshit . you can find death omens anywhere you want to . 
wait . i thought you meant the time of your birth . four / twenty - five as in month and day ... that 's a reach . 
like ... 4:25 . 
thirty - nine . 
as in flannels and plaids ? 
ohmygod ! ohmygod !   ohmygod !   he 's not dead ? 
i think . but why 'd they make him up like ... michael jackson ? 
doin' somethin' i 'm not supposed to . 
then let 's go see him ! 
that 's why i was there last night . 
like you the sculpture does n't even know what or why it is . reluctant to take form . and yet creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction . 
not a likeness . it 's how you make me feel alex . 
it is . but that did n't stop me . should n't stop you . 
yeah but everything 's always in transition . if you focus even now one week into summer ... you can feel autumn coming .   almost like bein ' able ... to see the future . 
he 's not a witch . 
we don't need this now ! 
i know what you 're doing !   it 's alright to be scared carter . you do n't have to prove to us how big your balls are . not now . 
get control of yourself ! 
not with us in the fuckin ' car ! 
knock it off ! 
he did n't say nothin' . just drive . 
they 're watching me see if i go to alex . 
what are you doing ? 
it does n't hurt .   why does n't it hurt ? 
what was that ? 
why you do n't feel love ?   not allowed ?   dead inside maybe ?   you make yourself dead already so they ca n't kill you ?   in - vulnerabo ?   bullshit ! 
yes you can . 
i know .   i go with you . 
you try get across laos ?   get to thailand ? 
in - vul - nerabo .   but you get ass kicked without me . 
you think you are ... . 
carefully .   do n't want to get shot by you .   bad karma .   anyway you need me . 
took bus most of way .   i knew you would come here . 
rambo .   nva coming .   pig dog kinh say meet them here .   whole garrison from con cuong is out . 
they heard about escaped prisoner on radio .   make deal .   more than we pay . 
yes .   but i lose many merits in next life .   very bad . 
nguyen is good boy . 
huntington beach california .

that 's not true ... you got ta ease up ... conversations have a life of their own . you got ta just go with it ... we're having a lovely conversation . 
i do n't understand you . what is the problem ? 
i ca n't believe you lived with her for that long . if i had to live with my mother i 'd stab myself six times . 
it 's a disgusting process . you have n't missed anything . 
tell me about it . i 've been dating longer than i 've been driving . i ca n't believe that . 
well do n't say it like that . it 's not so ... ya know crazy an idea . you are a healthy woman ... you hold a steady job . ya not crossed eyed or anything ... 
... so ... anybody special in your life ? 
that all depends on you . ... sure you do n't want a drink ?

oh sure ... got ta believe in god .   but i do n't think god made man in his own image .   no .   'cause most of ... the bullshit that happens is because of men .   no i think man was made out of the devil 's image and women were created out of god -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating and which also explains why women are attracted to men because lets face it the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- i slept with a few saints and let me tell you ... < u > booooorring</u > ! ! ! ... and so the whole point of life i think is for men and women to get married so the devil and god can live together and ya know -- work it out ...   ... not that we have to get married . 
oh i used to be such a catholic . 
okay .   ... i love you ... 
please ... before you go on ... let me tawk ... okay ... we 've had a wonderful time together ... when we first met you said this was n't serious and i should n't get serious and then you moved in and we have n't been serious . and i just wanna say that i have no regrets .   none .   and do n't wanna have any now so i want ya to be up front with me ... i want the truth . if you 're seein ' somebody else let me know ... you do n't have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me .   just tell me the truth . 
... so ... where did you sleep last night ? 
you 're all right ... you sure ... 
you were attacked .   my god .   should i call a doctor !   did you call the police ... 
< u > oh my god</u > ... < u > what did they do</u > !   < u > my</u > < u > god</u > ! ! ! 
< u > what</u > ! 
i ca n't tell you how distraught i was .   all night long .   what the hell happened ? 
i smell gas ... do you smell gas ... 
it happens to be a beautiful love story .   ya know you used to like that about me .   you used to say you liked that i did n't make you think so much .   that we could be together and not think ... 
then why the hell do we watch all the time ? 
well it 's funny !   whatta want from me ? 
why do n't you go upstairs ... take the day off . all right? ... i'll cook tonight . 
are you in a mood today baby ? is this one of those days when you 're in ... whadda call it ... an emotional abyss ?   talk to me cause i do n't understand these moods . 
no really .. i ca n't . 
oh no .. i have to get home ... 
i 'm paying you . 
i do n't feel like i make any impression on people ... at office parties i spend my time re - arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them so the platters will always look full . i do n't start conversations because i have no idea how to end them ... i think i 'm just meant to live in the background of things . 
i think some people are meant to be alone .   maybe i was a man in a former life and i used women for pleasure so now i 'm paying for it - which would be fine if i could just remember some of the pleasure parts ... 
i never really ... went through a ... dating period . 
meeting ... people . 
i mean it 's not easy in this day and age . 
well there 's nobody special ! 
do i look like i have someone special ? 
my parents were divorced . 
you threw him out ? 
will it hurt ? 
no thank you . 
i 've never been in an apartment above a store .   you always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them . 
i like your nails .   where did you get them done ? 
well i guess i 'll come back then . 
well did you or did n't you ? 
but now it 's free right ? 
okay ... twenty dollars ... when can you ... 
how much ? 
now what ? 
so how do we do this ? 
hello . my name is lydia sinclair . 
did phyllis in accounting tell you to call me ? 
well i mean ... i do n't know you ... this has never ... i 've never won anything and ... i do n't have a vcr . 
well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what ? 
well i do n't understand .   what did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or ... or ... a list ? 
which ones ? 
huh - huh . 
yeah ?   who is this ? 
you have a disease . 
you 're married . 
oh ... you mean you do n't want to . 
listen you 're very nice ... b ... 
listen i 'm not feeling well . 
and then we 'll exchange phone numbers and you 'll leave and never call and i 'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch .   why am i putting myself through this ?   it was very nice ... uh meeting you . good night .. 
... and then we 'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and ... and we 'll ... then you 'll sleep over and then in the morning ...   ... you 'll be distant and you wo n't be ... able to stay for breakfast ... you 'll just have some coffee maybe ... 
well ... you 're walking me home .   i ... i guess you 're sort of ... attracted to me and you 'll want to come upstairs for ... coffee ... 
i mean you do n't have to say nice things to me ... that kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we 're about to do . 
you do n't have to say that . 
no really .. believe me - there is n't any more . this is it . 
there is n't any more to tell . 
what do you do - for a living i mean ? 
how do you know him ? 
we mostly publish trashy romance novels . 
why does it sound exciting ? there 's absolutely nothing exciting about it . 
... i .. uh .. i get to read some of the books but mostly i .. just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback . after paperback it 's basically someone else 's problem . 
what a gyp . 
got any ethel merman ? 
i do n't like ... uh ...   polish love stories ...   ... i like musicals . 
oh ... like moses . 
parry parry ? 
sure you do n't want anything ? 
you got any change ? 
i 'm gon na go in that cafe an ' get some coffee . you want anything ? 
wait a sec . i want tita to take a picture of you an ' me in front of the place ... 
it 's all right . he do n't mean anything by that . 
oh am i holdin ' up dessert ? 
this certainly is an improvement on the motel an ' the coffee shop .   how could you have left such a beautiful place bobby ? 
it brings out my eyes ... 
or maybe sit out by the pool an ' get myself nice an ' tan for you . would you like that ? 
bobby do n't talk like that ... 
so how long am i supposed to sit an ' twiddle my thumbs in this place ? 
why ca n't i go out to your folks ' house ? give me one good reason . 
'cause if it was me i could just catch a greyhound back . 
well is that a happy face i see ? 
you 're depressed that i come along . 
i ' magine it 's me then id'n it ? 
are you depressed about your daddy honey ? 
just one minute you ! do n't you ever talk to me like that ! 
i 'll tell you ...   ... l - a - t - e - r. 
you like it ? 
you 'll be gone period . 
do you love me bobby ? 
if you really want a get up an ' leave me you can read about it in the newsprint . 
you 're goin' a find me dead one time . 
you go slippin ' around in front a my face an ' in front a elton an ' stoney . what do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way ... 
you treat me like i was . 
i 'm not some piece a crap . 
you 're the pathetic one not me . 
i hope they do . 
i 'm not . 
that was damn good wad'n it ? i finally did it ... 
i did didn ' i el ? 
i ca n't help it honey the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me ... 
is it my turn again ? 
i 'm tryin ' baby so do n't start gettin ' mad now . 
you know what you are never satisfied . 
i 'll go out with you or i 'll stay here and do anything you 'd like for me to do ... if you 'll just do one thing . if you 'll tell me that you love me . 
out where ? 
no dammit i would easy . 
serveza yourself ! 
sugar you know how i feel about you do n't you ? i 'm just tryin ' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things an ' what i 'm tryin ' to do with myself ...   you know there id'n anything in the world i would n't do for you baby . i started livin ' the day i found you you know that ? 
how 'bout if i just cut off your damn water ? 
now quit bobby . you said you 're goin' a help me pick a song . 
well lemme play the other side then . 
oh uh huh . i had a little kittycat once that bobby give me ... 
what kind of doggy is that ? 
i do eat slow as a bird whereas bobby can put it away like a speed swing ...   is there any ketchup around ? 
well thank you that 's a very nice thing for you to say . 
well i was goin' to but bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first which i can understand but then it went an ' took so long i ran flat outa money ...   i did n't have no number to call you know .   so i hadda clear outa there an ' come on up here in the hopes that i would n't be intrudin ' myself ... 
for two whole weeks an ' there was n't hardly nobody there to talk to but me . the manager of the place told me it was the off season an ' it must a ben because other'n me there was just this 25 - year - old kid delyon that did n't appear to be all there an ' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin ' for quiet . can you imagine ? all you could a heard there was a pin an ' them hollerin ' away ... 
you better hold onto your tongue ! 
well she was . 
bye robert . 
but what about me ? 
you were going without saying goodbye ? 
you 're leaving ? 
ca n't i have anything to myself dammit ? ! 
i do n't know where she is ! 
it 's none of your business ! 
my turn . 
sailors are sadistic i feel . 
you know he was formerly a sailor . 
i do n't think i 'd notice . i 'm so used to carl . 
why are you being so mean ? 
with applesauce ? 
do you want some gingerbread ? 
well you 're not going to run out on me right away are you ? 
oh let 's not talk about my hair it does what it wants to and anyway who cares i want to talk about you ... 
like what ? 
actually it 's very admirable the way she works . she 'll probably be enormously successful because she 's attractive as well not that that 's so important in music but ... 
constantly . night and day . and unless i get up before the birds i ca n't get in any practice time for myself ... 
i probably am but i do n't care . i mean i was n't that blessed to begin with and when would i have had time to make any improvements ... 
oh no ... why ? what is it ? the way i look ? 
no no i do n't think that i 'm just curious about it ...   do you think i 'm a freak ? 
well do you -- i mean have you enjoyed all these ... strange things you 've been doing ? 
we ca n't all get up and leave can we ? i mean there are certain needs you have to respond to ... 
i mean you think i 'm that happy ? 
a week or two is n't going to ruin your life for godsakes . 
it 's not that bad . 
he has ways of communicating robert . i can tell when he 's expressing approval or disapproval just from his eyes ... 
a couple of months . 
i do n't think you should infer daddy was wrong in front of him ... 
all right ... 
it 'll be so good for you and for daddy because you know you 've never really ... 
oh god i 'm so glad robert that you 're coming ... 
no i need to talk to you about so many things ... 
i know . 
i 'm going back up tonight . will you go with me ? 
he 's not ... they feel he ... maybe he might not recover and that he 'll either ... 
he 's had two strokes . 
daddy 's very ill . 
robert i have to tell you something ... 
it 's not funny . he permanently sprained his neck and since then it 's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin . 
well 11 months ago he was on his bicycle on his way to the post office in la roche ... and he ran into a jeep and sprained his neck ... 
catherine -- she 's a pianist . she 's working with carl . 
well herbert 's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra so at the moment there 's just daddy carl and myself ... and van oost . 
i have to talk seriously with you ... 
waldnit von schnechter . prewar . 
you know who it once belonged to ? 
this is a very special very old cb 275 ... 
thank you ...   oh no do n't put it on there ... 
you always do this to me . 
i just ca n't look at you . 
no i 'm not ...   i 'm not . 
robert eroica ... 
oh my goodness ... bobby ... 
what 's wrong carl you hardly ate anything ... 
i hope i did n't hear that . 
besides being very rude . 
i do n't think that 's true . 
oh no it 's been much more than that . 
i hope it will yes .   i 'm sorry . 
i 'm trying to be delicate with you but you 're not understanding me . it 's not just because of carl or my music but because of you ...   i mean what would it come to ? if a person has no love for himself no respect no love for his work his family his friends something ... how can he ask for love in return ? i mean why should he ask for it ? 
no . it 's useless robert . it would n't work not ever ... 
please i 'll see you later this evening . 
i 'm sorry everything 's been so confusing but i have to go robert ... 
what ? ! i ca n't hear you ! 
i ca n't do that . i have n't been being fair to carl . i have to tell you that . 
no i ca n't ... 
no you do n't have to it is n't necessary ... 
i 'll be back later ... 
i 'm going to pick up some friends of carl 's . are you all right ? 
i could spend some time with you tomorrow morning before carl comes back i mean if you 'd like to . 
do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now ? 
carl restored my confidence . he really did . he 's much more substantial than you give him credit for . 
as a matter of fact he 's the one who introduced me to carl ...   how are you ? 
something witty and devastating like that . 
i married him when i was 17 . he was a cellist and i thought he was the most brilliant man i 'd ever met ... and i 'm sure he was because at that age i had n't met that many ... but he was insidious you know . he had me convinced that i was a mediocrity musically as a woman as an intellect . but in this completely imperceptible pleasant way so that you were n't even sure he was doing it . anyway i just woke up one morning and i said you know something joseph you 're full of beans and i left him ... 
i do n't believe vou . 
no inner feeling . 
no do n't do that ... 
yes that 's what 's important to me ... 
i 'd like you to leave now . is that direct enough ? 
i do n't find your language that charming . 
i 'm not faking anything . i 'm looking for some bath oil ... 
i 'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks . and as for the day after tomorrow this is the day after tomorrow and i am unfortunately seeing you ... now if you 'll excuse me i 'd like to take a bath . 
i do n't think that 's accurate ... 
look ... you made a very calculated move and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you . that was n't necessary . 
i think it 's what you think . 
no you 're very good at it . i 'm really impressed . 
at being a fake . 
well at least you 're accomplished at something ... 
then i must have been supplying it . 
you had no inner feeling ? 
it does n't matter . it was the feeling i was affected by . 
is that funny ? 
i was really very moved by the way you ... 
that was beautiful robert . i 'm surprised ... 
you do n't call that music though . 
i mean how could you not play anymore ? that 's so strange to me ... 
one thing that 's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music and then just walk away from it without a second thought ... 
if you 're free . 
carl has hydrotherapy on tuesdays . 
tomorrow 's a full practice day ...   but the day after is kind of open . 
after that i plan to read some music and rest for awhile . 
right now i 'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself . 
i do n't know . let me give it some thought . 
nothing ? then it must be very boring for you here . 
well there 's fishing and boating . there 's concerts on the mainland and ... but i feel silly telling you . this is really your home . you probably know better than i what there is to do . 
i love to swim and i do n't mind the cold at all . it 's invigorating . 
yes intentionally . 
and you no longer play at all ? 
what have you been doing since then ? 
you have n't dampened my spirit samia ... excuse me . 
no i would n't . 
and what about love ? 
then you got ta hide it somewhere . somewhere where nobody 's gon na find it ... for 29 years !   put it under the loose floorboard by the window ! 
the future guy ? 
so am i. 
i 'll be upstairs ... if you want to play . 
i know .   he loves that thing . 
honey what is it ?   just tell me . 
do you know how much i love you ? 
i 'm off . 
boy is he excited about the game tomorrow . 
i love you more . 
probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work ... 
you give him his drops ? 
where 's johnny ? 
frank ... what 's wrong ? 
frankie johnny wants to say goodnight . 
nothing wrong with old age frank ... long as you get there . 
he did . 
butch called . 
how was your tour ? 
you did n't marry donna reed . 
i think i ruined the sauce ... again . 
well why not a little of the king ? 
hey bud . 
i 'm sorry .   i did n't realize ...   but she knew john .   a mother knows what 's in her son 's heart . 
then i 'll bet she 's real proud of you huh ? 
are you a good cop john ? 
you 're mom sounds like she 's got some smarts . 
my six year - old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman .   right after he retires from the majors .   we just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday . 
hey future boy .   frank tells me you 're a cop ? 
you work too hard john . 
oh i loved it .   i wish you 'd gone . 
fine .   you know dr. schwartz retired last month ? 
i 'm sure everything'll work out .   she really loves you ... 
i 'm sorry sam could n't make it . 
i thought it 'd be nicer to eat here . 
hi this is julia .   please leave a message after the tone . 
i vote for the hammock . 
that was the best yet .   was it you ... me ... or the hammock ? 
think you can figure it out ? 
first we take off our clothes then you get on top of me or i get on top of you ... 
how about you and i whacking a couple of balls around ? 
you can play with yourself 'cause i 'm going in the house . 
not now .   i 'm cold . 
what 're you doing ? 
we 'd be all alone .   we could do anything we wanted and nobody would see . 
why do n't we go take a swim ? 
what was that ? 
no way .   we 're pregnant .   remember ? 
cool it andy . 
maybe this was n't such a good idea . 
a hammock ? 
what 's this ? 
come on down ! 
i do n't know .   i flunked spanish . 
okay we wo n't .   we 'll just have fun all agreed ? 
which one is it ? 
have you ever made love in a hammock ? 
your bed . 
you go ahead ... 
what are they saying ? 
i appreciate the fact that you worry about me but do n't . 
it 's the last house on the left . she lives downstairs . 
sort of . 
could we move a little faster ? 
when you dropped me off at the house it was very late .   my parents were waiting up for me . as soon as i got in the door they starting yelling and cursing at me .   i was so upset ... i told them i slept with you .   my mothers slapped me .   that was the first time she 'd ever hit me .   i could n't believe it .   i ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as i could run . i was crying .   they had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and i wanted to punish them for that .   i decided to hide out all night .   they 'd be so worried that they 'd be sorry for what they did to me .   the woods were cold and damp from the rain .   i found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and i guess i fell asleep .   all i can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps .   i thought it was my father so i hid behind the tree . but the footsteps just stopped . the woods were dark .   i could n't see anything .   i heard a cracking noise behind me .   i turned around and ... and ... oh god ... there was this hideous looking man .   so grotesque he was almost inhuman .   he had a knife and he started to slash away at me again and again .   i was so hysterical and i do n't know how i was able to get away .   i ran and ran but he kept coming .   he was big but so fast .   he caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he ... he ... ripped my blouse off . i was screaming but who could hear me ?   then ... oh god ... he dragged me by the hair along the ground .   i was kicking and yelling .   he dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods .   oh please ... please ... 
you promised you 'd never ask me . 
i 'm trying .   i 'm really trying . 
i 'm here with you .   ca n't that be enough for now ? 
... to prove something to myself ... to prove i 'm stronger than i think i am . 
the quiet can fool you .   it fooled me .   you can never be sure of what 's out there . 
it 's deceiving . 
why do n't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset .   it 'll mellow you out . 
no .   i can look around by myself . i 'll take the upstairs . 
are you all right shelly ? 
i 'm serious .   does n't this look a little strange to you ? 
somebody was in here . 
did you stay here last night ? 
this door was open just a minute ago was n't it ? 
just slow down .   let me get to know you again .   let me get to know this place again . 
i do n't know . 
you have n't changed a bit .   always so sure of yourself .   even when we were kids when you wanted something nothing could stop you . 
you know what i 've been through . do n't ever scare me like that . 
derek ... stop . 
you 're wrong . 
i do like you .   but not when you act like a jerk . 
why do you do these stupid things ? ! 
damn you shelly ! 
do n't say any more . 
we 're really sorry but it was n't our fault . 
we had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang ...   ... but shelly made them see the error of their ways . 
this has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country . 
you 're the boss . 
see anything ? 
may be please have the wallet . 
everything 's gon na be fine . 
come on shelly .   who else is gon na give him a lift ? 
why do n't you help us ? 
destroy the evidence pronto ! 
in that little thing ? 
what d'ya got in there ? 
you 're shelly ? 
i do n't care about being hip anymore . 
but she might be in trouble ... 
have you seen tamara ? 
jason ... voorhees ? 
what 's going on ? i heard on the p.a. system that ... 
i think i 'll pass . see you later okay ? 
what are you going to do ? 
i have her in creative writing and she 's fairly nice . 
i guess not . 
it 's not that it 's just that ...   it i get caught i 'll lose my science scholarship and everything . 
no thanks . 
sounds good . i hear there 's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool ... 
my parents are open minded about that sort of thing . 
what are you going to do ? 
he bought you that ? 
but ... wait a minute ! 
time to check out the waiters . 
that was truly excellent . 
relax i 've got mcculloch covered ... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter .   rumor has it she 's a teensy bit afraid of the water ... 
nobody related to mcculloch can be nice . 
a real space cadet . i wonder if she 'll narc on us ... 
do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now ? come on it 's grad night . you 've got your whole life to be uptight . 
you 're talking to the prom queen eva . do you really think i 'm going to risk getting caught ? 
what ? do n't be a lightweight ... this is top dollar toot . 
you 're joking right ? 
i think it 's time for some recreational activity girl . 
my stepmom could n't care less but daddy would have a shit fit .   he might even pay some attention to me . 
he 's undefeated you know that ?   julius is the only senior i 'd even consider doing it with . if he was n't black that is . 
improvise of course . 
a major prick . 
more or less . it 's part of my college fund . 
it 's my graduation gift from daddy . it cost over a thousand bucks but it 's the best . 
i 'm sure we 'll have no problem getting them to party with us ... especially with this . 
i hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties . 
but i have n't even shown you my biology project ... 
i packed it . just for us . 
they 're out of town . 
i do n't think that 's such a safe idea 
there must be a phone around here somewhere . 
nothing ! i went to her cabin and ... 
what are you talking about ? 
he 's doing the best he can charles . 
did you find rennie ? 
but that does n't prove that he 's the one ! 
what are you doing ? ? 
oh dear god ... 
where is she ? 
she 's fine charles . take it easy ... 
no i think it 's just the beginning . 
and she sure does n't have one now either . she needs to live . 
and neither do you . it 's up to rennie to decide what she wants to do . 
charles there 's someone else coming along too . 
do n't be . they probably decided to explore each other rather than new york . 
hello charles . has everyone checked in ? 
only one young boy ever drowned in that lake and that was before you were even born . his name was jason voorhees . 
did you have an accident in the lake ? 
after your parents passed away ? 
when did this start ? 
maybe not . but you 're not telling me everything are you ? 
i had a skiing accident in high school broke my left leg . it took three winters before i would even look at the snow again ... but the solution kept eluding me .   i finally took lessons . i 've never broken a bone since . 
i gathered that . 
i seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone .   in other words level with me . 
so are you having fun yet ? 
no but i 'm sure toby 's fine . the ship 's only so big and there 's certainly no way off it is there ? 
rennie -- i was just on my way over to your room 
rennie you 're the best student i ever had ... you have a real gift . if anybody can make use of that pen it 's you . 
stephen king supposedly used it when he was in high school . 
since the school is closing anyway i 'm going to write that novel i 've been threatening on everybody . 
did you know that i 'm giving up teaching ? 
everything okay ? 
you let me worry about him okay ?   personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers rennie . you made the right decision . 
i 'm glad you decided to come after all . 
you pushed me ... 
i ... i ca n't ... 
i 'm not staying in my room uncle charles . 
but what about the drowning boy i 've been seeing ? 
ca n't we at least talk about it ? 
but sean said ... 
i 'm staying . 
i do n't even know why i 'm afraid uncle charles . i ca n't even remember when it started . do n't you think it 's time i found out and got over it ? 
she did n't push me into coming . 
i 'm staying . 
no . it was just a normal summer . i 've never been able to figure it out . 
about four years ago ... at crystal lake . i spent a few summers there with uncle charles inbetween boarding school . 
whenever i get near the water i see this young boy drowning . he tries to pull me down with him . 
it 's not that simple . 
i ca n't swim . 
there 's something i have n't told you ... 
yeah ... a lot . 
have you seen my dog anywhere ? 
i do n't know what to say ... 
that 's wonderful miss van deusen ... what 's it about ? 
just felt a little chill . 
what about not - so - great writers ? 
me too . but i 'm not sure uncle charles will be . 
please hurry ... 
drugs ...   then jason came . he 's here sean . 
i 'm not ! ! 
i 'm not going near any lifeboat ! 
is the ship going to sink ? ? 
the window ... 
just radio for help okay ? ? ? 
where are they ? 
what do you mean ? ? ? 
what about you ? 
can he really take us home ? 
i want to go home . i want off this ship . 
i 'd love to . 
but i did n't get you one ... 
we changed our minds . 
hi sean . 
alla puttanesca . 
elliot litvak . have you been ill ? and mr. rogan . how nice . 
guys ready to order ? 
he feels he has to defend himself if necessary . 
he goes to the theater armed . 
our steven not only disguises himself . 
never mind . 
do you want to talk about doing crazy things . 
but you do n't even know me . how can you care what i do with whom ? 
if i 'm sleeping with him and i have n't said i am then so what ? 
no one 's waiting . 
he 's a very sweet man . 
do you think he can do it ? 
sort of . sometimes . you 're not building an obsession about steven are you ? look . i understand opening- night jitters but you 've got one of the great actors in american theater starring in your play . 
steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy . no friends . no phone . 
is what true ? 
the fact is i have to get going . 
he does n't want to meet some out - of- work ingenue . 
peter redmond is an actor i admire enormously . 
i hear good things about the new play . 
i was one of those silent listening children . glued to the shadows . 
alla puttanesca . 
a little drastic maybe ? 
he has -- something . a funny little quality i find -- 
a little . 
not one of steven 's finer moments . 
i think i remember . 
i was in the fish - market play . what happened to him ? 
we have a very nice pasta today . alla putanesca . 
i 'm going home to my machine . 
i do n't want you steven . 
yes . i 've seen your victims . one past and one future . i thought i might convince you to reconsider . 
not if you stopped hurting people . write the truth gently . 
in other words i never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you 've been causing with your reviews . steven it 's so unfair . 
i have n't come to you . 
he will absolutely hate it . 
it 's your best play nicky . 
it makes me so mad . steven schwimmer ready to strike . the exterminating angel . 
i used to tell myself . talent is more erotic when it 's wasted . will i see you tonight ? 
because we 're completely mismatched . 
we 're able to surprise each other . 
i 'm proud of this play . it 's so different from anything you 've done . 
it ca n't be all that personal . 
you mean the world series ? i thought the red sox were winning . 
ever since he started reviewing the broadway theater nobody in this business has been worried about anything else . 
steven schwimmer . the most powerful critic in america gets his first crack at nicky rogan . 
that 's not all nicky . i 've been backing your plays for fifteen years . and i 've never been more depressed . 
they 're watching him closely . there 's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon . to bolster his confidence . and that 's not all . 
peter redmond . they found out why he ca n't remember his lines . there 's something living in his brain . a parasite he picked up in borneo doing the movie . 
apparently it did n't help . you know about peter of course . 
she died . 
what about her ? 
alan 's very sick . he has to go to new mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution . 
last night . alan albright called me a handsome woman . second time he 's done that . son of a bitch . 
daddy wait . 
will i believe you when you tell me something ? 
what will we talk about ? 
except i wo n't have a father anymore . 
i 'm not sure . 
i have a class . i 'm late . 
i do n't have a date . i do n't want a date . 
rogan laurel . you also have a rogan lillian . she wo n't need it . sell it . 
i know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition ? 
thanks daddy . but i just need one . mother 's not going . 
i did n't turn her into mother . you did . 
mother wo n't tell me how long you 've been seeing this person . she 's embarrassed to tell me . so why do n't you tell me ? 
she is kicking you out . 
oh please . not now .   she wants you to stop seeing what's- her - name . finally . now and forever . do you think that 's too much to ask ? for a wife of nineteen years . 
because you refuse to believe she 's serious . you 've always refused . 
because they get outstanding settlements . and mother is determined that this time there 's no turning back . 
she 's doing like those iranians . ` i divorce thee . i divorce thee . i divorce thee ' 
is it ? 
so at the intermission i can listen to the ball game . do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer ? 
i 'm seeing your play tonight remember ? 
i do n't drink coffee daddy . and this is not what we should be talking about . 
i go to college . i thought you knew . 
see daddy . 
what else ? 
see daddy . 
yes . and no more evasive tactics . 
you wo n't even tell me your name . what 's shocking about a name ? 
knowing who a person is . down deep . 
deception is n't something i personally consider sexy . 
what do we want ? 
i have this thing where i have to know a person is being honest with me before you know i can feel completely free to be myself . 
a flat - out hit . 
packs an emotional wallop . 
brilliantly moving . 
you have to tell me what you thought of the play . 
i 'm willing to tell you my name . 
why wo n't you tell me your name ? 
i 'm glad we 're having this talk . 
i never thought of dr. wetzel as having a sex life outside the office . 
it violates so many trusts . 
she 's my gynecologist . 
nicky no . this is insupportable . how could you ? 
joanne bourne . 
i want to know . we have n't talked this way in years . 
be open with me . i 'd like that . 
that 's very lovely actually . 
i 'd forgotten that . 
you know why do n't you ? because i am patient chain - smoking lillian . 
that 's always been my problem . 
who the hell cares ? 
i do n't want to be responsible for his food . just a small green salad . and a perrier . 
he has his own submarine . i 'll be getting everything that matters . i 'll get new york and i 'll get connecticut . 
i 've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer . 
i want to be fair - minded nicky . 
i 've been looking for you because i want to let you know what 's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column . 
your father said you might be here . 
this could be it ! 
do n't worry . it 's a test . 
because faith is rewarded . 
washed away . 
because god loves a winner . 
speak it like it 's real . matthew . 
then say it . 
say it and you 'll believe it . life is good . say it . 
if you believed you would n't be walking around with a handgun in your belt . what does that tell me ? you want to make the night come down . 
you 're afraid to risk believing . believe in them . believe in your self . take a risk . it will humanize you as a person . 
you made him strike out . you wished it on him . you want to lose . it 's too hard for you to believe in something . it 's hard to have faith . it 's hard nwork to trust somebody . 
it may be work but it 's not honest work . faith is the real work . 
your problem is you take the easy way out . losing is easy . 
it 's a simple subject . 
and the people he hurts the most are the people who love him . despite who he is and what he does for a living . we 're always saying we want to take control of our lives . you do n't want to take control . you want to lose control . jesus knows it . 
an how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy and then in one dumb moment what does he do ? 
you 're a family man frankie ? 
go on tell him . tell the truth . tell him how you feel shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody 's flesh who was once a child who was once the same age as this boy . somebody 's flesh who was innocent once . 
frankie lazzaro . coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media . children see this . they think you 're the secretary of the treasury . 
you 're charming the boy . 
you see what you 're doing do n't you ? 
that 's a simple subject . 
this is one charming crook . if shooting people is charming . 
he does bless me each and every day . matthew 's mother works a hospital shift so i pick him up at school . we stop for a meal usually around this time . he does his homework and gets some experience meeting people . but we never had a famous mobster before . 
matthew 's my grandson . 
might be an accident on the west side highway . 
the most charming gangster in new england . where are we going mr. lazzaro ? 
matthew look at him . when i lived in roxbury the media followed this man everywhere . he was bigger than ten movie stars .   where 's your white lincoln limo ? 
you 're frankie lazzaro . the gangster from rhode island . 
i 'm looking at you trying to think . put your face in the mirror . i know i recognize you from somewhere . 
what 's wrong with him ? 
i 've been looking for him .   do you know where he is ? 
it 's about the director . 
good to see you 're feeling better . 
not so long -- just once around the sun . 
--when you go away . 
what is it ? 
you hypocrite .   do you think for one moment you 'd be doing what you 're doing if it was n't for who you are--<i > what</i > you are ?   do n't you get < i > any</i > satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish ? 
so you 're not so smart after all .   i want you to know -- if it ever came to it-- i 'd be willing to get an ovum from the egg bank .   in fact i 'd < i > rather</i > use a donor egg--   --<i > if</i > it came to it . 
what happened ? 
my medication .   i left it back there . 
i ca n't . 
who are they ? 
what about the car ? 
why are we leaving ? 
what < i > is</i > this place ? 
so you did n't do it after all . 
of course i think about it every day . 
nothing yet .   i 'll start experiencing symptoms in my late - fifties .   but unless they come up with something between now and then i wo n't live much past 67 . 
it 's here .   my heart .   i 'm careful -- weekly check - ups .   i 'm on a drug maintenance program blood thinners diet--   i just want you to know what you 'd be getting yourself into . 
i do n't think so .   the only trip i 'll make in space is around the sun--   --on this satellite right here . 
i envy you jerome . 
you 're angry-- 
you did n't know ? 
you celebrate jerome ? 
just some in - valid .   vincent--   --somebody . 
in the south wing . 
they found an eyelash . 
i know about you . 
i 'm sorry .   i did n't mean anything . 
why would we do that ? 
i was at home . 
can that be er verified ?   were you alone ? 
i 've been asked to compile a log for the investigators -- they want to know everyone 's whereabouts last night . 
what now ? 
i guess we are . 
whatever happens ... we 're going all the way . 
are we going to make it ? 
how long before this car 's hot ? 
they will have our description before we can get a plane . 
where do we go from here ? 
who was it ? 
you 're crazy . 
so what ? 
what is it ? 
get in the shower . you 'll feel okay . 
what 's wrong ? 
i 'll be ready . 
oh jesus ... how ? 
great . i 'm going to sleep twelve hours . 
that 's all i want ... it 's the only thing i have ever wanted . 
can we make it ? 
things ca n't get much worse can they ? 
sounds good . 
no more about beynon . 
i always thought jails make people hard . not you . you 're just not tough enough to forget about beynon . i chose you not him . 
we 've come a lot of miles . but we 're not close to anything . 
i do n't think we can any more ... if we ever get out of here maybe i should take off ... 
i do n't want to hear it . 
it 's all a game do n't bother me . 
no scars ? 
i think so ... i do n't know . 
not now . 
twenty eight hundred . 
el paso . 
only one car . 
you keep it up and it wo n't matter how far we get away because it 's going to be all over between you and me . do you understand that ? there wo n't be anything left . 
i 'll tell you something doc . one day you 're going to have to trust somebody ... 
if i had n't killed beynon . you would have . 
i did i killed a man . 
that would be the first time . 
maybe . at least i got to him .   where do we go from here ? 
you 're full of ifs . 
why there 's nothing on the news ? 
like what ? 
you 've got it all figured . 
you 've got all the answers . what about when they find the body on the train ? 
do you mean that ? 
what do you want to do ? 
when we had trouble before it was different . 
you 'd do the same for me would n't you doc ?   if i was caught would n't you ? 
i can handle it . 
i would n't worry doc . i can always get you out ... i 'll screw every prison official in texas if i have to . 
you bastard ... 
fifteen minutes . 
he must have . 
a man helped me open it ... 
what do we do ? 
she 's on tv . 
what the hell do you want ? mary tyler moore ? 
you sent me to him . 
there was n't any way to explain it . 
i do n't want to go there . 
let 's send his cut back -- just keep going . 
do you trust him ? 
he might be ready to chop us up . 
there are three men dead . 
call the ranch tell beynotr we 'll leave his cut here -- 
what about the bank ? 
... and live happily ever after . 
we are always going to be all right tomorrow . i 'd like to be all right a few todays . 
i mean it . 
it doesn!t make much difference where you are if you 're waiting doc . 
you know i 've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes ... worn out waiting . 
it will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more . 
i feel like the night before the first day of school . 
promise you wo n't laugh . 
you know how i feel ? 
if we are clean gollie will take us over at nogales . if we are hot we 'll have to try laughlin at el paso . 
for exits off main street . 
usually on the right side as you go in . 
want to cry now ? 
but sometimes i cried a lot too . 
i laugh when i feel happy . sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh . i had a lot of that . and other times that was n't enough . i had a lot of that too . i know you find it hard to believe i 'm happy just loving you . 
but i got you out . did n't i doc . i did it . i got you out .

look i 'm me right . you 're not . we are what we are like it or not .   why all the bloody needle ? 
he was gentlemanly . i like that .

you 're a bastard .

what about keith ? 
thorpey nearly died laughing . 
and what about you ? did you kill brumby ?

i 'll call the police . 
and what you going to do ? 
inside ? why should i give house- room to your sort ? 
do n't come that bloody flannel with me . if you 're a traveller i 'm bloody twiggy .   and who 's he ? 
you do n't look it .

it 'll cost you .

what is it ? 
do n't be bloody silly . you 're the first since monday . 
will this do ? 
are you a traveller ? 
it never is . 
her husband docks tomorrow does he ? 
i see . 
when is it finally over ?   i want it to be over before my baby is born . 
what the hell does that mean ?   come on tom speak out straight once in your life .   i know michael ca n't but you 're not sicilian you can tell a woman the truth ; you can treat her like an equal a fellow human being . 
he 's not the same as when i met him . 
that 's the first time i 've seen the lawyer side of you tom .   it 's not your best side . 
what kind of a family is this ... are we human beings ?   he knows his father killed his uncle carlo .   he heard connie . 
... he said he had shot his grandfather with a gun and then he died in the garden .   and he asked me ... he asked me tom if that meant now his father would shoot him out of ... revenge .   how does a four year old boy learn the word ... ' revenge ' ? 
am i a prisoner ? 
how long does this go on ? 
i 'm going to see my parents . 
i was supposed to take the children to new england next week . 
i 'm supposed to stay in my house . 
whose orders are these ? 
i 'm going to the market . 
it was n't a miscarriage .   and you with your cunning could n't you figure it out !   it was an abortion ; an abortion like our marriage is an abortion something unholy and evil .   i do n't want your son ; i would n't bring another of your sons into this world .   an abortion michael ... it was a son and i had it killed but this must all end ! 
the baby i lost ... 
you have n't heard me . 
at this moment i feel no love for you at all .   i never thought that could happen but it has . 
oh i do feel things for you michael ; but now i think it 's pity . for the first time since i 've known you you seem so helpless .   you held me a prisoner once ; will you try again ? 
goodbye michael . 
i 'll bring the children up now ; they want to say goodbye . 
you would have killed his brother ? 
and that 's all he had to do .   just show his face . 
i did n't even know he had a brother . and where is he now ? 
tell me michael .   what really happened with pentangeli ? 
i think it 's too late for changes michael .   i promised myself i would n't talk about it and i 've gone and spoiled it . 
i 'm not going to stay long ; i ca n't . 
in a minute .   they 're outside with esther .   i 'm very happy for you ... i suppose i knew that you 're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you . 
i wanted to see you before you went back to nevada .   also the children - michael they 're here . 
leave her alone !   you 're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard . 
it made me think of what you told me once .   in five years the corleone family will be completely legitimate .   that was seven years ago . 
yes michael it does . 
sleeping inside me . 
yes michael . 
i 'm sorry michael .   senator geary 's here and mr. and mrs. barrett wanted to thank you before they left .   wo n't you join us mr. ola ? 
anthony daddy 's busy . 
is that all this conversation means to you ?   am i going to put out or not ? 
sure you 're free for now at least . but how long before you 're just alone ?   pathetic and alone . 
what are you then ?   what will you be ten years from now ?   still cutting lawns ?   still banging horny divorcees in your trailer ? 
the look on your face !   you 're not marriage material .   you 're not even boyfriend material .   you 're a kid . a big fun slightly irresponsible kid . 
you know i just ca n't do that anymore .   i still have time to get things right .   get married again -- 
sure .   i loved it . 
no i 'm actually kind of glad it happened .   it made me wonder what the hell i was doing with my life . letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you . 
it still hurt .   a lot . 
you picked up that girl right in front of me . 
all the old men i know think about nothing but sex . 
it never crossed your mind ? 
do you realize you 're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me ? 
yeah and i 'm never going to smoke another cigarette . 
it means it 's too cold to go swimming .   and i do n't mean the water . 
not so famous any of us have ever heard of him . 
what 's to be jealous of ? 
funny is funny and scary is scary . you do n't mix them . 
these old movies are such a hoot . they thought they were being scary but they 're just funny . 
this looks corny . 
not anymore you do n't .   doll . 
all right then .   he 's interested in you for your conversation .   we know what a great talker you are . 
just thinking out loud . 
i say let loverboy watch his movie .   and be grateful boone 's not cutting shirley temple 's lawn . 
you are right .   yes .   we must put him back . 
do you want to be questioned about you and mr. jimmy ?   please clayton .   it will be better if i find the body alone . 
the police will not know that . they will want to investigate . 
you must leave .   you were not here this morning . 
he says here good - bye .   i find it in his room .   he is sorry he says . he has had a wonderful life . 
oh mr. jimmy . 
what have you done with him ? 
it is my job .   i did it when he was happy and it was easy .   it is only fair i do it now when he is ill .   enough talk .   i must wake up the master . 
what do i do ? 
i blame my daughter for keeping me out so late .   i only hope you did not get him excited .   it could give him a new stroke . 
there is nothing you can say that will surprise me . 
i have brought you your clothes . all i ask is that you get dressed and go .   we are having a guest for breakfast . 
yes .   i trust you . 
good .   that is what i hope .   i did not think you a bugger too .   i fear only that you might hurt him if he tries . 
you and he are not doing things ? 
you did not know ? 
that is why he must go to hell .   i do not think it fair .   but god 's law is not for us to judge . 
yes !   you know ? 
what is the good english ?   all i know is bugger .   he is a bugger . men who bugger each other . 
no .   his is the worse .   the unspeakable .   the deed no man can name without shame ? 
this is what the priests tell me . his sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven . 
no .   i have children grandchildren too .   i visit when i can .   but now that mr. jimmy can not be left very long i do not get away much .   poor mr. jimmy .   there is much good in him but he will suffer the fires of hell .   very sad . 
he is dead now twenty years . 
of course .   i am married still . 
a man who is not married has nothing .   he is a man of trouble . you need a woman . 
your wife ? 
no .   we live simply mr. jimmy and i.   people come to play bridge . and now and then young men to swim .   you have people boone ? 
long enough .   fifteen years . 
no .   you are a guest now .   you go in the living room . 
the master is dressing .   i am to offer you a drink .   there is whiskey and there is iced tea . 
expect nothing fancy . 
the master wants to know if you are free for lunch .   i tell him you will be having other plans but he insists i ask . 
no .   no .   i am sorry .   forget everything i say .   here .   i will take the tray . 
you will not hurt him ? 
what kind of man are you ?   are you a good man ?

cos there were those dark days when i figured - my god how easy it was for him to just give it up ; to make the deal ; take the rot for the whole crew ... and give me up in the process . 
we were good when you bailed were n't we ? 
you mentioned that in your letters 
that 's what i want ...

i do n't care what his family 's like or if he does n't have any brothers but he does n't have to lie to me . 
i just wanted to find out what was going on ... but now that i 'm here it seems strange does n't it ? 
see now this does n't feel right .   when i made the decision to come over here it felt right . i had all these rationalizations ... i just do n't understand why will never tells me anything he wo n't let me get close to him he tells me these weird lies-- 
is this a bad time ? 
i guess so . 
this is your house right ? 
you were the only sullivan in the phone book . 
i wanted to meet your brothers ... 
see ya ' chuckie . i had fun . 
what class ? 
i love you will .   no take - backs . 
i never cared about that . 
you know what i want to hear ? i want to hear that you do n't love me . if you tell me that then i 'll leave you alone . i wo n't ask any questions and i wo n't be in your life . 
yes i do . did you ever think that maybe i could help you ? that maybe that 's the point that we 're a team ? 
yes i do will . 
yes will . i did n't even know that ? 
what about your twelve brothers ? 
you 're afraid of me . you 're afraid that i wo n't love you back . and guess what ? i 'm afraid too . but at least i have the balls to it give it a shot . at least i 'm honest with you . 
fuck you ! you think i want this ? that money 's a burden to me . every day i wake up and i wish i could give that back . i 'd give everything i have back to spend one more day with my father . but that 's life . and i deal with it . so do n't put that shit on me . you 're the one that 's afraid . 
i inherited that money when i was thirteen when my father died . 
is that what you think-- 
well what are n't you scared of ? you live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you 're scared shitless to do anything else-- 
why wo n't you come with me ? what are you so scared of ? 
then what are you afraid of ? 
look will if you 're not in love with me you can say that .

so do you play the piano ? 
just for fun ? 
have you ever studied organic chemistry ? 
all right mr. nosey parker . let me ask you a question ? do you have a photographic memory ? 
rich ? i have an inheritance . it 's two handred and fifty thousand dollars . that 's exactly what it 'll cost me minus about five hundred bucks to go all the way through med school . this is what i 'm doing with that money . i could have done anything i wanted . i could have expanded my wardrobe substantially . 
it 's important that i learn this . 
i thought you said you 'd show me your place . 
you men are shameful . if you 're not thinking of your weiner then you 're acting on its behalf . 
what if i said i would n't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends ? 
is it me you 're hiding from them or the other way around ? 
i think i can make it to south boston . 
what about your friends ? or your brothers ? when do i get to meet them ? 
i 've never seen your place . 
why do we always stay here ? 
i 'm supposed to understand this . 
how the hell did you do that ? 
if you bring the caramels . 
you were busy ? you know i really was waiting for you to call me . 
where have you been ? 
i want to meet them .

oh you will ? 
yes you were . 
yes you have . you were thinking you were gon na get a good night kiss . 
you know what i mean . i know you 've at least thought about it .

have you ever seen annie hall ? 
well i 'm gon na experiment on you for my anatomy class then go . 
stanford . i 'm leaving in june after i graduate .

intractable sir . you leave tonight . 
they were very upset . 
in detroit . this weekend . 
they blame you for the compromise . 
they say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep . 
they 're not happy sir . 
that 's going to cost . 
all of it ? 
it 's from one of those p.o. boxes . how was the trip ? 
wait . i have mr. grocer for you . 
and a leader . did n't she meet castro on foreign exchange ? 
take care of her . she 's a keeper . 
of course you will .

we had a good laugh did n't we ? 
you do n't have a headache . i have a headache .

you lived in chicago ? 
ha ... if you 've never lived in a city with museums theater music restaurants uh ... god a million things then it 's something i ca n't explain .

it 's a man 's world mr. booker . most women have to . 
that 's your cue to say you 're not laughing at me . 
you stand still too long in new york you get hit by a bicycle messenger .   you know sometimes i get the feeling mr. booker that you 're laughing at me . why is that ?

it 's uh ... beautiful country . i had a little bit of a hard time finding the place . there are no signs . 
mr. booker if i could just ex -- 
i 'll pay you for your fare . i 'll send you to montana first class . 
well if you could just come for the day . new york 's only a few hours by plane i 'd have you home by dinner ... 
well you know however you want to put it -- i got your information from the publisher of the article . i called montana and your sister - in - law i think gave me this number .   i 'm been hot on your trail you could say because i was hoping you 'd consider coming to new york and taking a look at my daughter 's horse and possibly -- 
i went on the internet and found this article about you ... it says you 're a horse whisperer that you ... you help people with horse problems . and you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized -- 
this is annie maclean . 
go ahead ... 
how 's everything ? 
oh i miss you . you look beautiful . 
well ... honey ... you know ... that 's just not his way . maybe you can write him a letter or something . say thank you ... do n't think about it ... you take care and i 'll see you home . 
what 's the matter honey ? gon na miss pilgrim ? 
let 's bring your bags inside . 
uh nothing . i 'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me ? 
because you are ... one of the most ... incredible bravest most beautiful woman i have ever met . the efforts you make . your courage and your dignity .   i do n't know where you got it ? i honestly do n't know how i would have handled all this if i were you . 
that 's not true . 
what ? ... oh baby ... 
when ? tonight ? 
started what ? 
what did you say ? 
well then i do apologize ... but what i 'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she 's feeling ... who ca n't admit when she 's wrong and who ca n't forgive when she 's not . 
listen if ... if there 's a part of you as parent that ... that takes pride in your child -- that you can look at them and see something you 've accomplished as well ... if that 's wrong then i 'm sorry .   but it was n't my intention . i do n't push for me . i do it for you ... so you do n't waste half your life feeling like you do n't know where you belong . 
i do n't deserve that . i have never looked at you as a disappointment . if i 'm on your back to do better if i push you to try harder it 's because i want you to be the best you can be . 
what ? ! how can you --   i 'm sorry if my friendship with tom bothers you so much but i happen to value having someone to talk to especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what i say it 's wrong and no matter what i do it 's wrong ... i 'm sorry i 'm such a disappointment to you . 
stop it ! why ca n't i talk to you ! ! 
look i just wanted to say i think it 's great you 're riding again . and ... and i think i know why you you needed to do it alone ... without anyone knowing ... 
i was just trying to say thank you to diane and frank and -- 
grace i do n't hate your father . 
what are you talking about ? 
honey nobody 's trying to cure you -- 
well ...   so you tried riding again ? 
grace ? is everything all right ?   can we talk ? 
did you go riding ? 
thanks honey . 
does anybody out there want something to drink ? 
you 're right . good . 
well one was for salad ... 
uh i do n't honey . branding ? oooh ... i think we 'd just be in mr. booker 's way . 
no . i just thought ... forget it . 
honey come on . would you like to stay in town for dinner ? maybe see what movie 's playing tonight ? 
you got everything you need ? 
yeah he 's going to think about it . you want me to pack for you ? 
you already did . 
he 's still sitting in that damn field . 
there was supposed to be a turn off . did i miss it ? 
do n't they believe in signs here ? 
you buckled up ?   you cold ? 
it 's ... it 's not that simple to explain . i know you think it is but it 's not . the truth is i do n't really know what i want to do . i do n't have all the answers . 
that 's not true ! 
did he tell you that ? 
that 's not true ! whatever problems your father and i are having have nothing to do with this . 
i do n't believe this ! 
who do you think i 'm doing this for ? i 'm doing this for you ! 
do you want us to turn around and go back home ? do you ? 
you know what i mean ?   is this it now ? is this the way we 're going to be from now on ? 
how long is this going to go on ? 
this 'll be nice . we have n't seen any of the sights yet . it 's history . when i was thirteen i used to love seeing things like this . 
i do n't care . 
would you like to see that ? 
you do n't . 
oh . you did n't tell me . 
you should call your dad before it gets too late . 
it 's almost lunchtime . are you hungry ! ? 
look if you want to take it in the morning that 's fine . 
no i do n't mean you have to . it 's just that we may not have enough -- 
you want to take your bath ?   we have to get up early tomorrow . you may not have enough time to -- 
i think that 's ... very compassionate and ... mature way of looking at it . 
well ... how you feel all right about telling liz to put him down ... 
have you decided about pilgrim ? 
grace i put it on the table near your -- 
i brought it to you in the hospital . 
it 's still early . what 's your next class ? 
you are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself . you 're going to get up and you 're going to figure this out . 
grace listen to me . your body is just healing . you have to give the rest of you time as well ... 
oh . well what are you going to do ? you have to go to school honey . i mean what -- 
oh honey ... what happened ? 
dad'll pick you up today all right ? 
why do n't you go lie down ? 
liz is taking care of him .   the doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can -- 
uh yes ... sure david . 
what the hell does that mean ? how much more do i have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me ? 
oh come on ! this is such bullshit ! the work is getting done david . lucky keeps me on top of everything . 
david he signed an agreement that he would n't talk to the press and he 's libeled me by saying i faked the figures . you 're not going soft on me are you ? 
yes . we 're suing . 
everyone . working overtime . just for you . 
where to ? 
i have so much to tell you . 
mmm . i made good time .   pilgrim 's in the back . i found a new stable but they ca n't take him until tomorrow . 
what do you mean ? 
i do n't understa- 
what do you mean ? 
yeah what ? 
probably first thing in the morning . it 's too late to start now . i 'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark . 
are you going to stay in the city or go up to connecticut ? 
let 's not talk about that now . 
no it 's okay . believe me there were plenty of times i did n't know what the hell was right . 
you do n't have to explain . you have every right to come . 
you 're allergic to hay . 
oh . i did n't look at my faxes today . we left before sunrise . 
about what ? 
fine . actually today was a good day . you should have seen her . 
everything all right . 
oh robert i 'm sorry . we were so tired from the branding . grace barely made it to her bed and i did n't have the energy to take my clothes off . 
i know . we miss you too . 
you know i just asked that myself tonight . he does n't know . 
yeah but nothing i ca n't handle . lucy tells me she thinks gottchalks 's plotting but what else is new . 
well it 's good that you 're there . 
yeah . she seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch which is why i said yes to this move . but whenever it 's just the two of us i do n't know ... anyway ... what 's happening with the delco lawsuit ? 
no that 's not what i said . i 'm not a dictator . if you feel you should come then come . just do whatever you think is right . 
she will if you think she should . 
robert we 're losing her . we 're losing her .   i do n't care what the doctors say . the truth is they do n't know anymore than we do -- less when it comes to grace ... this may not sound sensible or ... logical but nobody 's suggesting anything better . i ca n't explain it robert . i just have this feeling ... this annoying ... bloody feeling that if ... if somehow pilgrim can be made all right ... then so can grace . i just know it ! 
i do n't care what he says ! we have to do something robert ! i ca n't sit here and trust everything 's going to work out just by pretending it will . 
i ca n't say he 's been all that effective with her . 
why ? ! 
i 'm in charge . i went back very soon after the accident . they did n't expect me for a couple of months . i 'll just take that time now ... i can still oversee things from montana ... take my fax ... my computer ... 
he 'll be sedated . i know horses robert . i 'm the one who taught grace how to ride . 
i 'm not asking you to . i 'll do it . 
no . i was just researching . calm down . 
i 've called liz . they can set me up with a trailer for pilgrim . i thought we 'd stay at motels along the way ... 
robert grace is n't adjusting to school . and she ca n't sit in this apartment all day ... i think it would be good for her . 
he did but ... i think i can change his mind . 
about us going someplace warm ... someplace grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses ... 
why did you go ? 
how was the dinner ? 
helping all the time ! running to her every time she trips or falls ... anticipating her all the time . 
you 've got to stop doing that ? 
do you ? do you really ? 
aw ... that 's so sweet . 
you can hardly get your arms around me . how depressing . you 're so early . 
sing it to me frankie ! 
oh . right . i 'll call him . 
we 're very lucky . 
no i 'll go . you stay ... in case she wakes up . 
i should go get some of her things . 
what did he say ? 
tch . what are you -- 
robert you leave it up these people ... ! 
that bag 's almost empty . 
what about grace ? 
yeah . bye . 
i do n't know . we 'll figure it out . 
i 'm sorry about last night . i should n't have brought it up over the phone . 
sure ... what 's grace up to ? 
i should be in by two . 
it 's me . 
what choice ! ! ? 
it 's so cruel . 
absolutely . i made enough for an army . 
well did you ever think about hiring a business manager ? 
oh i do n't know ... 
you know that 's interesting . i always wondered when i went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a black angus steak . i could n't taste any difference although i could swear one was more tender . i did n't know there was that big a difference between cows ...   i 've never been on a cow farm before . i must say the bulls seem to have the best time of it . just laying around the fields all day until they 're asked to ...   do their ... work . 
you too diane . 
it 's just one night . if i get uncomfortable i 'll go over to hanks . 
i already know the way ... and it 's not like i have a job i have to rush home for .   between you and me i could use the time alone . 
oh how sweet . 
no no i 'll go -- just give me a list . 
is there anything you need ? i 'm going food - shopping . 
i do n't think anybody can make tom do anything he did n't want . 
sounds like something tom would say . 
frank 's a good man . 
did you always know this was the life you wanted ? 
delayed shock . or maybe not . i know i could talk my way back if i wanted or ... go to another magazine someplace ... just not sure if i want to . 
no it 's more like a leave of-   ha ha ha . yeah they fired me . 
well i have more than a few days ha ha ... i uh ... i 'm sort of ... not an editor anymore ... right now ... first time i 've said it out loud . 
you and frank ever take a vacation ? 
but uh egypt is well it 's like nothing else . it 's like going back in time .   i remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age centuries ago walking over that same ground was wondering about or if they had the same problems as me ... and i felt connected to ... to time itself almost . ha i never realized how hard it was to describe . 
oh god -- i think it was the fourth or fifth time i 'd been there so all i remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was ... 
i was there for that shot actually . 
well ... i know i should reject that offer but i 'm not going to . 
thank you . you 're all doing too much . 
i got a little confused though . the ranch ellen was talking about -- that 's not this one ? 
she calls him tommy ... 
where does this go diane ? 
it 's fine . comfortable . i still ca n't get used to how dark it gets around here though . when we leave the ranch i always hold my breath until i can see the motel . 
oh uh thank you . no we do n't want to impose . 
uh no we 're going to dinner ... is this the way to the pasture ? 
would you mind if i did ? i 'd like to talk to him . 
of course not . 
maybe we should give him another sedative . 
and i can say the same thing about my daughter ! but she is suffering ! can you solve that problem !   i ca n't deal with this now liz ! if you need a yes or no right now then no -- do n't do it ! not until i know grace is all right . now please ! just do what you can . okay ?   please . 
... i just do n't know right now ! do whatever you can and when grace is -- 
- see what you can do for him -- ... 
liz listen the doctor 's here and i just ca n't uh ... talk now ... so -- 
well of course right ... 
wait uh i i do n't understand . start again -- he 's alive ... 
her leg was shattered so they had to uh ... remove it . she had some bleeding but it 's under control . 
so do you . 
smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in sheriden . he wo n't be back for three days . i ca n't believe he did n't want to say goodbye . 
tom 's gone . 
wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves ... 
who is it ? 
so special . because i was the only one . you both wanted me to be so good at everything so perfect and i was n't . i was just me . and now i 've completely ruined everything anyway ... 
i 'm sorry ... about what i said . it 's just that -- all those times you and daddy were trying for another kid i ... i used to pray at night that it would work . and not because of you guys or that i wanted a brother or sister ... but ... just so i would n't have to be ... 
why should they ? 
who 's ever going to want me ? nobody will . 
who 's going to want me now ? 
i felt it happen downstairs and when i went into the bathroom . 
my period . 
i said ... i started . 
leave me alone ! ! 
yeah well you 've done a great job . 
for you ! because i 'm your daughter which means you 're the best mother ! is n't that what you 're always talking about in interviews -- having it all the great career the great family ... proving everybody wrong . wanting everybody to think you 're this perfect woman ! 
well now you know what it feels like . 
no you stop it ! stop pretending like you care ! like this really is n't about you and tom . 
yeah you know everything ! ! 
i ca n't remember the last time you made him dinner . 
you ... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much . 
... you worried everything all right now and we 'll have to go home ? 
yeah . does that mean i 'm cured ? ! 
about what ? 
i 'll take care of it . 
mom they do n't mind eating with one fork . 
i thought there were too many forks on the table . 
i 'll come . 
why ? there 's no food in the house ? 
if i had everything i need i would n't be going to physical therapy . 
did he mention it ? 
did you ask him to come visit ? 
we 'll have more room because we 're moving onto the ranch . they have this empty house near this creek . it 's actually pretty ... ok ... i love you .   dad wants to talk to you . 
i think they call it a pasture . 
i did n't see it . 
gee this looks like a fun place . 
no you just act like you do . 
then why do you want to leave ? 
he does n't have to ! it 's like so obvious you ca n't stand him . 
you 're amazing ! you act like i do n't live in that house ! do n't you think i hear the two of you ! ? do n't you think i can tell what 's going on ? i 'm not five years old mom !   you want to divorce daddy and daddy does n't want to . 
you just want to get away from daddy and you 're using me to do it ! 
bullshit ! it 's about you ! about you deciding ! about you always being right ! you always getting everything your way controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something ! 
what are you asking me for ? you did n't ask me if i wanted to come in the first place -- now i get to decide ? forget it ! 
you were never thirteen mom . 
i do n't care . 
i did n't know i had to . 
i already did .   this morning . when you went running . 
whatever you want . 
i do n't care . 
-- enough time tomorrow . i know . 
fine -- i 'll take my bath . 
i mean i 'm not much use anymore . why ca n't they be compassionate to me ? 
maybe they should put me down too . 
i think we should . it 's not fair to let him suffer . he 's not much use anymore . he 'd hate living like that . 
what about him ? 
does n't matter . 
no you did n't . 
i ca n't find that charm daddy gave me from india . 
is that your version of a pep talk ? 
i 'm not coming back ! that 's it ! i want to go home ! 
does n't matter . i ... i do n't want to come back that 's all . 
i do n't want to lie down . i 've been lying down enough . 
i ca n't even get out of bed yet ! you 're already putting me in therapy ! ! 
you know you 're a good kid . 
i do n't thinks you 'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody . 
of course i have . 
would you let me ride your horse ? 
why do you always wear that hat ? 
do n't you go to school ? 
no you 're only going to hurt him some more . 
i want to watch . 
what does that mean ? 
i ca n't ... not yet ... 
i know where he goes . 
are you afraid of anything ? 
we bought him in kentucky . my mother and i took a trip down there to see him . 
i do n't know if i can . 
i do n't know if i can with my leg . 
i ca n't ... 
drive ? i 'm not old enough yet . 
that 's not a question is it ? 
is n't it like obvious ? 
not like books or literature or anything . just a magazine ... just in case she has n't told you -- which i 'm sure she has n't -- i do n't want to be a part of this ok ? 
she 's an editor . 
probably . she 's on the phone twenty- three hours a day . 
jude you okay ? 
you want to go down or stay along the river ? 
do you want to go around by the old road ? 
... oh come on ! you think the same thing ! 
can i come ? i 'll start a fire ... 
you want to go to a movie tonight ? 
i did . he said he had work to do until late . 
can we show him pilgrim tom ? 
did you notice -- no cane ? 
i want to see pilgrim . 
maybe ... look -- just ... 
no i 'm just not that hungry . 
dad ! i can do it ok ? ! 
how 's pilgrim doing ? 
have you heard from judith 's parents ? 
good luck to you annie . 
now are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself ? there are plenty of people ' round here who do that sort of thing . 
i think i 'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave . just might be his first broken heart . 
well i am going to go after lunch . 
he 's a good man tom is . he 's got a gift come from heaven above i swear . but he 's still a man . and a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he 's on dry land . 
annie i 'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let 's just say what it is . when you first came here i did n't like you and i was worried . tom means a lot to me and this family . do n't go looking here for whatever you looking for . do n't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time . 
yes it does . 
they do n't come better . but i do n't deny there are times i wonder about things i wo n't have . maybe one day i 'll get to see egypt . maybe not . but i know if you try too many different lives you can wind up with no life at all ... 
i fell in love . after that i never thought about being anything but a rancher 's wife . i never saw it like i was losing some other life just felt like i was gaining one . i know that 's not a popular opinion nowadays and i ai n't saying it 's the right one . we all have to find the life meant for us . 
guess you do n't have to figure it out until you go home . 
you do n't seem to upset ? 
they fired you ? 
must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work huh ? 
soon . we 're going to branson missouri to see my cousin emma married . frank loves in there . 
i 'd love to go there one time ... 
what was it like ? 
i was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the pyramids . were you ever in egypt ? 
no reason you should no reason you should . 
i 'll help you with the coffee . 
oh it 's ... i wanted to tell you that if you 'd like you being so busy i could take grace to her therapy exercises for you . i have to go in once a week for shopping anyway . 
ha she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old he ran off . they found him in the barn sleeping between two giant hooves of a percheron stallion . she said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise . 
always did . i think she favored him a little . you tend to when you have more than one even though you love 'em all the same . 
mm - mm . i never knew him . he died before frank and i met . this here 's ...   frank and tom 's mother and father ... there 's little frank and tom ... 
oh you can just set up on the dining table . i have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow . 
how 's peterson 's holding up for you ? 
no imposition . plenty of food . gon na get pretty dark soon . hard to find a place . 
mrs. maclean -- why do n't you and daughter stay for dinner ? 
pasture ? oh that stretch of field near the hill ? yeah . 
sure .   does your daughter want to come inside ? 
there 's coffee inside ... i was just bringing this to tom . 
frank 's touchy about his cousins .   well it was nice to meet you mr. maclean . 
oh frank do n't forget the wedding present -- it 's behind the door in the laundry room .   i got her a pasta maker from the catalogue ... not that they 'll know what to do with it in branton missouri ... probably use it as a planter . 
they 're already all settled in frank . anyway i 'm sure annie wants her privacy . 
i guess they 'll want feeding and all out here all day long . 
... well i just think she 's got a lot of nerve showing up here . draggin ' that child and that poor animal all the way ...   you eat with those fingers again and you know what 'll happen !   frank do n't you think she 's got a nerve ? 
i have some brownies left over . want one ? 
ai n't brain surgery . 
well that 's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from new york . 
what they ai n't going forty miles into choteau everytime they want a hamburger . 
go fix the phones . 
never send a boy to do a woman 's job . with me we can do it in seven . 
phreak and joey are being framed . we need your help to figure out what 's on this disc . 
yeah ? you know if you would have said so in the beginning you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble . 
i ca n't believe they decided you won . 
you would have looked better . 
oh wow she 's great .

the worm eats a few cents from each transaction . 
uh hold on ...

that 's not true . here i am . 
why did n't you wait for me ? 
he was . old jerko found a way to sneak out . listen i 'll call you in an hour or so . 
if you watch her i 'll consider talking to ben tramer in the morning . 
he went out drinking beer with mike godfrey and he wo n't be back until late . you'll have to call him tomorrow . besides i 'm on my way to pick up paul . 
i ca n't . 
this has not been my night . my clothes are in the wash i spilled butter down the front of me i got stuck in a window ... 
you 'll have to . he 's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up . 
you guys will make a fabulous couple . 
well i just talked with ben tramer and he got real excited when i told him how attracted you were to him . 
what would you say if i told you that you were going to the homecoming dance tomorrow night ? 
i hate that dog . i 'm the only person in the world he does n't like . 
for that matter i might as well be a girl scout tonight . i plan on making popcorn and watching doctor dementia . six straight hours of horror movies . little lindsey wallace wo n't know what hit her . 
i always said you 'd make a fabulous girl scout . 
what 's the pumpkin for ? 
that 's probably all he can do . 
mister riddle was watching you ? laurie mister riddle is eighty - seven . 
probably mister riddle . 
you still spooked ? 
i doubt that . listen my mother is letting me use her car . i 'll pick you up . 6:30 . 
now you hear obscene chewing . you 're losing it laurie . 
i had my mouth full . could n't you hear me ? 
of course . 
why did you hang up on me ? 
well home sweet home . i 'll see you later . 
it 's tragic . you never go out . you must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much . 
poor laurie . you scared another one away . 
subtle is n't he ? hey creep ! 
i do n't see anything . 
look where ? 
terrific . i 've got three choices . watch the kid sleep listen to lynda screw or talk to you . 
i have a place for that . 
i 'm never smiling again . paul dragged me into the boys ' locker room to tell me ... 
come with me . 
look lindsey i thought we understood each other ... 
well come on get your coat . we 're going to pick up paul . 
then why are you sitting here with half the lights off ? 
i know . pull my legs . i 'm stuck . 
lindsey open the door ! i 'm locked in the laundry room ! 
lindsey lester 's barking again and getting on my nerves again . 
get him out of here ! 
you 're going to be late ! 
you 're going to be late at the doyles annie . 
the only things missing were some halloween masks rope a set of knives . what does that sound like to you ? 
someone broke into the hardware store . probably kids . 
hi annie laurie ... 
where were you ? i went back to the myers house ... 
i 'll stay out with you tonight doctor just on the chance that you 're right . and if you are right damn you for letting him out . 
more fancy talk ... you want to know what haddonfield is ? families . children all lined up in rows up and down these streets . you 're telling me they 're lined up for a slaughterhouse . 
well it 's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes . 
you 're not coming up with much to prove me wrong . 
nothing 's going on . just kids playing pranks trick or treating partying getting high ... i have the feeling you 're way off on this ... 
you all right ? 
i 'll check back in an hour . 
i keep thinking i should call the radio and tv stations ... 
what do we do ? 
looks like to me you 're just plain scared . 
a man would n't do that ... 
come on ... a skunk could have killed it ... 
not since 1963 since it happened . every kid in haddonfield thinks this place is haunted . 
ten minutes . 
may be a few minutes . i got ta stick around here ... 
lee brackett . 
deal . hey i thought paul was grounded . 
wait a minute here ... 
yes you can . 
i 'm glad you 're here because i have something i want you to do . i want you to call up ben tramer and tell him you were just fooling around . 
annie you did n't . tell me you did n't . 
i 'd say you must have the wrong number . 
what 's this big big news ? 
i brought it for tommy . i figured making a jack - o - lantern would keep him occupied . 
he can still watch . 
he was watching me . 
i saw someone standing in mr. riddle 's back yard . 
i was n't spooked . 
sure see you later . 
i 've already lost it . 
i thought it was an obscene phone call . 
why did n't you say anything ? you scared me to death . 
annie was that you ? 
okay . bye . 
the guys think i 'm too smart . 
he was standing right here . 
that man who drove by so fast the one you yelled at . 
behind that bush there . 
i'm baby sitting for the doyles . it 's only three houses away . we can keep each other company . 
i forgot my chemistry book . 
exploring uncharted territory ? 
what 's wrong annie ? you 're not smiling . 
have a good time . 
they probably stopped off somewhere . have her call me when she gets back . i 've got lyndsey here and i want to know what time to put her to bed . 
no . i thought she 'd be home by now . she went to pick up paul . 
nothing . i was just sitting down for the first time tonight . 
annie some day you 're going to get us all in deep trouble . 
i do n't think so ... 
i thought you were babysitting tonight . 
as usual i do n't have anything to do . 
i think you have too much to do tomorrow . 
no ! do as i say . 
i killed him ... 
now i want you to change your clothes tommy . we 're going to take a walk outside . 
do what i say ! now ! 
be quiet ! get lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door ! 
tommy i want you to go back upstairs ... 
tommy let me in ! 
i said stop it ! there is no bogyman . there 's nothing out there . if you do n't stop all this i 'm turning off the tv and you go to bed . 
tommy stop it ! you 're scaring lindsey . 
i promise . 
and i 'm here tonight and i wo n't let him get to you . 
we 're no getting anywhere . all right look tommy . the bogyman can only come out on halloween night right ? 
what did he look like ? 
there was no one outside . 
tommy halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them . it 's all make believe . 
do you believe everything that richie tells you ? 
there is no such thing . 
after the jack - o - lantern . 
after the movie . 
i 'm so embarrassed . i could n't face him ... 
' neutron man ' ... ' laser man ' ... i can see why . ' tarantula man ' ... 
why are they under there ? 
but king arthur was always your favorite . 
see you . 
lonnie elam probably wo n't get out of the sixth grade . 
just watch . 
yes i am . 
sure . sure . 
same time same place . 
hi tommy . 
listen to me . i want you to walk down the street to the mackensie 's and knock on their door . you tell them to call the police and send them over here . do you understand ? 
now i want you to walk to the door down the stairs and right out the front door . 
there 's nothing to be scared of now . get changed . 
you 've had enough . why do n't we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie . 
everybody has a good time tonight . okay kids what do you want to do now ? 
i do n't think this is any time to be funny ... 
what did he say ? 
should n't we pick him up ? 
the only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish . when they start raving on and on ... 
you do n't have to make this harder than it already is . 
what does that mean ? 
only minimum security . 
your compassion is overwhelming doctor . 
i think we should refer to ' it ' as ' him . ' 
are there any special instructions ? 
he 'll barely be able to sit up . 
what did you use before ? 
i ca n't believe it ! 
oh listen ... 
come in come in . 
mm - mm ! 
it 's so pitch - black tonight .   i feel lost . 
you matter to me .   completely . 
well what do you do ?   do - do - do you talk to holly or lee or what ?   do you do you do you phone them ? 
do you talk to holly or lee behind my back ?   do you ?   you must .   they- they seem to know so much about us . 
well what is it then ?   what ?   eh what 's come between us ?   how have i alienated you ? 
i 'm not accusing .   i 'm asking .   do you ... do you find me too ... too giving ?   too - too - too competent ?   too - too i do n't know disgustingly perfect or something ? 
have you been talking to holly or lee about us ?   about our - our personal life ? 
what you of c-- what are you talking about ?   of course not .   i 'd be destroyed ! 
are you ? 
well what ?   what wh - what are you not telling me ? 
are you in love with someone else ? 
do you feel um ... are you disenchanted with our marriage ? 
are you angry with me ? 
yeah but i ... uh -- i thought you needed that .   when - when - when we met you said your life was chaos . 
but what do what do you--   what 's that mean ?   w - w - we've been we 've been married for four years . how settled can things get ? 
i want one with you . 
well tell me .   should i be worried ? 
why do you say that ?   is there something wrong ? 
why not ? 
yes you were .   a - and when i when i brought up the idea of having a baby you just you jumped down my throat . 
yes .   i know .   the last few weeks you have n't been yourself .   and tonight at tonight at dinner you you were kind of curt with me . 
are you in a bad mood ? 
it 's so late . 
where 're you going ? 
holly and april thanks for helping . 
god mickey 's such a hypochondriac . i wonder how he 'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him ? 
i know . 
ohhh but i 've eaten five of these . 
she has all the cooking talent . 
i know !   i know ! 
are n't they great ? 
have you tried these ?   these are wonderful .   holly and her friend made them . 
oh mom ! 
it 's on the table dad . 
hi mom .   how you doing ?   here let me get you some coffee .   that 's enough of that .   what triggered it ? 
do n't make it worse dad . 
hi .   how 's she doing ? 
... just for a second .   so now i got that out of my system and i can go back to the thing that makes me happiest . 
i do n't know about that .   oh no i just see i - i've been very very lucky .   w - when i had the kids i decided to stop working and just you know devote myself to having the family and i 've been very very happy   but ... i've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage ... 
i am ... i did slave all day . 
get his wine away . 
i know she ... she really writes good dialogue . 
what 's the matter ?   what 's the matter with you ?   you look pale .   you okay ? 
what do-- ?   you 're being ridiculous . 
i mean i do n't know he 's seeing someone else or something but ... 
i 've been trying to talk to him about it .   he says everything 's fine but i do n't know . automatically you know i leap to the worst conclusions . 
yeah .   i - i do n't know what 's wrong with him .   he 's just ... kind of distant and difficult . 
oh he 's fine .   he's - he 's i guess he 's fine .   i do n't know .   he 's been kinda moody lately the last few months . 
y - yeah . 
i 'm okay . 
i ca n't believe elliot and i ca n't think of someone nice for you to go out with you know-- 
do you miss frederick ? 
so how are you ? 
... 'cause every time i try to be helpful you know sh - she gets so defensive . 
i hope you tell her it was your idea ... 
oh yeah ?   how 's she doing ? 
hi .   where 's holly ? 
oh yeah ? 
does n't she look pretty ? 
you look so beautiful . 
oh i don-- ask elliot for that . uh he 's got them somewhere . 
you 've outdone yourself . 
aah ... hey have you tried holly and her friend 's shrimp puffs ? 
um i - i did n't really want to you know go to a sperm bank or something have some anonymous donor .   i - i just you know i - i - i would n't want that . 
w - w - we - we've decided after a lot of discussion that we - we'd try with artificial insemination . 
just think about it .   that 's all i ask . 
i want to experience childbirth . 
yeah they have these banks you know where they keep them frozen . 
you know where i - i - i would get implanted from a - a donor . 
well what about artificial insemination ? 
i do n't know .   excessive masturbation ? 
could you have ruined yourself somehow ? 
this is the second opinion . 
is there no chance ? 
that 's a beauty ! 
thanks thanks . 
you know he 's been wanting a mitt . 
that 's really nice ! 
i know i know . 
i think so . 
i think he 'll find that satisfying . 
oh you know what ?   i 'm trying to convince him to produce a play . 
he 's fine . 
here you guys .   open them up . 
everything 's good .   everything 's fine . 
two minutes on your sons ' birthday . you know it 's not going to kill you . 
very good . 
glad you could put in an appearance . 
hi !   hi ! 
now holly 's not shy . 
i just had a lot of luck ... from my first show you know ?   i 've always thought lee was the one destined for great things . 
yeah i know mom . norma   but i i knew that he 'd get up there and he 'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes .   he 's all show !   now how can you act when there 's nothing inside to come out ? ! 
okay okay . 
okay stop being so dramatic . 
you promised to stay on the wagon . 
here mom .   drink this .   you know you 're awful .   you probably were flirting . 
... from mavis also . 
i do n't see how you could know about these things unless elliot 's been talking to you . 
i don't ... i do n't want to bother everyone . 
yeah we 're having some problems but problems that are my business ... which i do n't see how you could know about in such detail . how does lee know about these things ?   how ?   they 're private ! 
you 're grateful but you resent me . 
you make it sound like you know i have no needs or something .   you think i 'm too self - sufficient ? 
can i can i not accept gestures and feelings from people ?   do i do i put people off ? 
it 's obviously based on elliot and me . 
i 'm real upset about what you wrote . 
take ... take a year .   take six months .   whatever you want .   who knows ?   maybe you 'll maybe you 'll be sitting with a good play . 
write !   let 's just not talk about it anymore . 
look .   listen .   listen .   you want to write ?   write . 
you 're crazy !   that 's not true . 
you 're too demanding . 
i'm - i'm always happy to help you financially .   i think i 've gone out of my way to - to introduce you to interesting single men .   there 's nothing i would-- 
not so !   no .   i think i 've been very supportive .   i've ... i try to give you honest constructive advice . 
no .   she did n't she say it was um ... she said it was in the publicity department .   that - that can lead to other things . 
well i do n't know .   we 'd uh uh um ... did n't mom mention there was something ... something at the museum of broadcasting ? 
well that - that 's good .   it just uh ... it just seems to me that - that six months or a year if - if you spent it more productively ... 
well that ... th - that 's fine . 
oh god ... 
oh gosh . 
oh what do they know ? 
hey hi ! 
look everything 's going your way . 
what ?   you do n't do n't be so sensitive .   ca n't i say anything ? 
i hope . 
... every eh single rejection as- as - as a ... a confirmation that you have no talent or something ? 
no i did n't i that 's no .   no i- i - i no i - i just ...   hate to see you put yourself in a position where where you get hurt you know .   you know you know how you take ... 
uh - huh .

he 's not a loser at all ! 
it 's uh you never know--

it 's almost ... almost uhhh entirely wholly interdependent if you know what i mean .   i - i ... i ca n't put it into words .   the important thing is - is - is it - it breathes . 
oh is that what it is ? 
oh it 's magnificent ! 
oh in this we 're a big hit . yesterday i auditioned for come back little sheba .   that i was n't such a big hit .

we 're a big hit . 
hannah will invite some men over who do n't look like ichabod crane .

only a few .   a few .   do you like 'em ? 
no he has n't .   if i offended you i 'm sorry . 
that 's the point .   i 'd like to be bothered .

y - you mentioned to me yourself that you and elliot were having some problems . 
oh wow !   i do n't want to have this conversation .   i did n't do anything wrong . 
wow i guess i hit a nerve . 
oh so loosely . 
my script ? 
hey what 's the matter ? 
what 's the matter ? 
what 's the matter with you lee ? why are you so sensitive all of a sudden ? 
hey hannah i know i 'm mediocre . 
you know i could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with ! 
uh losers !   all losers ! 
you never have any faith in my plans .   you always undercut my enthusiasm . 
you treat me like a loser . 
yeah you mean not at my age . 
boy i knew you 'd be discouraging . 
yeah that 's clerical . 
well - well like what ? 
but what i decided to do is some writing .   yeah i think i 've had it with acting .   you know these meaningless auditions at cattle calls .   and i ca n't handle another rejection .   now let 's face it here .   i got ta you know latch on to something in my life .   you know -- something with a future .   i 'm not sixteen anymore .   it 's just ... crazy !   i 've got ... an idea for a story . more than one .   and i just need a few months you know or uh a year even . 
yeah although it 's put an end to the stanislavski catering company . which is why i have to speak to you . and ...   you 're gon na get impatient but ... i have to borrow some more money . 
you got it . 
they said i was too offbeat looking whatever the hell that means .

nobody but you can do that to me . i do n't know why . 
tch well i sing !   for chrissake hannah you heard me sing ! 
boy you really know how to cut me down . 
yeah .   well maybe i 'll get it . 
w - why ?   you do n't think it 's realistic ? 
uh you know i think i can fake my way through a song . 
i mean y - you know do n't say it that way you know because my confidence is not my strong point i-- 
you know . 
well you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well ? 
well i mean why not ?   you know wh - what have i got to lose ?   uh ... 
yeah can you believe it ? 
i 've got a singing audition for a broadway musical .   of course i 'll never get it . 
well i think he was dying to open up .   it 's so sad .   now ... what should i wear to my audition ? 
... he 's really paid his dues but ... then she helped put him through architecture school you know so ... 
... and then she just breaks down .   and he has this sweet daughter ... and when she goes to college next year he 's going to split permanently .   i mean ... 
sometimes she 's terrific ...

maybe at christmas new year 's .   if not this new year 's maybe next new year 's . 
not this thanksgiving you know . 
oh perfect !   he reminds me of ichabod crane .   his adam 's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited . hannah   listen .   he 's a lot better than your ex - husband .   he 's got a good job .   would you light those please ? he's - he's - he 's not a dope addict or anything . 
oh he 's such a loser !

hannah i know it 's a lot but my friend april and i we have this catering idea i think 's going to be great . 
two thousand dollars . 
someday i 'll pay it all back . 
this is the last time i promise . and i 'm keeping strict accounts . 
hannah i have to borrow some more money .   do n't get upset . 
get outta here .   could i speak to you privately ? 
mmm ... i mean we love to cook for our friends so   we thought until an acting job comes through we could just make some extra money you know doing a few private parties . 
no no we decided ! 
i 'm pregnant . 
just a few minutes ago . 
sure .   sure uh yes . 
it 's all right . 
that i 've always regretted the way i behaved that evening we went out and uh ... i've i just thought i 'd tell you that because i really made a fool out of myself . 
um ... look there 's something i 've uh that 's been bothering me for a long time and i just thought i 'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here and   that 's this . 
gosh you really went through a crisis you know that ?   h - how did you get over it ?   i mean when i ran into you you seemed you seemed just perfectly fine .   well you seem fine now . 
y - you used to-- oh no !   yeah i care .   you used to be so ambitious and ...   god you really liked it ? !

uh gee .   would you like to have lunch ?   uh uh ...

oh gosh i do n't know .   well could i come over tomorrow and read it to you ? 
so uh ... i threw it out but i have this other one . 
oh no !   it was n't anything bad . but she just ... you know .   i do n't know . 
... hannah read it she got really angry and ... you know then i felt badly so i-- 
actually my first script was about hannah and her husband but uh ... 
but you have to remember while you 're reading and you 're cursing my name you know that this is my first script .   well it 's not my first script . 
well i 'd love it if you 'd read it actually 'cause i really would value your opinion . 
oh i 'm fine . 
you 're okay though huh ? 
oh .   oh . 
you 're kidding me . 
i have n't .   no the reason why i ask is i think it might make a great uh television script and you know you 're so active in television so--

it 's been nearly a year since our first time and you 're still married to my sister which ... i now realize is fine because you 're probably much more in love with her than you know . 
i 've got to be honest with you .   i met someone else .   i 've met someone else .   i ... i told you i was n't going to wait forever .

no .   that 's right .   that 's all part of it . 
.... that 's right . 
well you know you know you know the < u > point</u > is :   i < u > can't</u > tell you .   cause you have n't < u > been</u > there .   you have n't < u > done it</u > . and that 's all there < u > is</u > . 
i 'm sorry i do n't mean to be impolite . because you know you ca n't understand . 
yes then you 're saying that you < u > haven't</u > bid upon these drawings . 
... sir ... ? 
< u > someone</u > offered three million dollars bounty on dr. lechter 's head . 
because sir you are the only one of his victims who lived .   and because you have large resources . 
because if it was not you then perhaps it was dr. lechter trying to reclaim his own property . 
sir various drawings done by dr. lechter while in prison stolen from the prison after his escape have surfaced and are being sold at auction .   several large reserve bids have been placed on them .   i have to ask if you 've placed those bids . 
no sir it 's not my job to capt ... why do you say how terrible ? 
i 've come to see you sir about an auction ... 
that that was < u > business</u > ... 
no this is < u > pleasure</u > ...

... get me a cigarette . 
... and then we 're going to < u > greece</u > ... 
oh my < u > program</u > ... 
it 's a < u > joke</u > .   you 're a joke .   you 're a joke .   you do n't know what money < u > is</u>-- your idea of money ...   ... spend it on a whore on your ' business trip . '   that is the fine limit of your ambitions ... 
.... because we do n't have any mmm ... 
because we can not < u > pay</u > ... 
then we can not go . 
yes yes yes your thirty thousand dollars reward which you would have to split with your team which < u > if</u > you get it will not buy me a new < u > watch</u > ... 
... they asked us to dinner .   how can we accept if we can not < u > return</u > the ... 
because it is exclusive ... because < u > everyone</u > will be here ...

nobody really changes at summer camp . they merely find out who they are and become it more than ever .   you ca n't be helped wichita . i 'm not sure you can be punished either . but let 's find out ... 
yes !   god yes !   i would tell her that i love her !   to not let anyone take away her dreams .. ! 
yeah why should we let our actual personalities get in the way of us falling in love ? 
is n't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one ... we're just so different . 
i have to get up . still more to do . that boy hates asian people . that girl thinks she gave her mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand . her daddy touches her . his daddy never touches him . it would have been cooler if i 'd died . 
something more interesting than that ... how could you ?   how could-- ! 
ah our last night at camp ... i always knew it would be something special . 
excuse me wichita i ca n't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room . could you ... 
be nice . her father died in that twa flight the government shot down ... you know i 'm going to be in the city next week . my mom says it 's okay that i stay overnight at your dorm ... it'll be nice to see you in                           ] a different shirt .                                           ] ] wichita                                             ] oh i did n't tell you . i wear this                           ] all year round . the chicks dig it ...                         ] 
do you really think we 're fooling anyone ? 
oh my gosh why did n't you say something earlier ... 
are you allowed to do it more than once a night ? 
fuck off . 
do n't worry you ... 
and you 'll be happy to know i 'm going to drop my snow white and the seventy dwarves act ... not all of it but ... 
about ten years a -- why ... don't look at these ... come on ... stop . 
do n't be . do n't be sorry for your thoughts . they make me ... react . i do n't know ... all i know is that i ca n't go through another summer where i < u > almost</u > did something . 
what else do n't you believe in ? 
do you really not believe in god ? 
gosh this is really a great conversation -- i ca n't believe i said that out loud . 
i think your condescension is even better . 
ann taylor would have paid a lot more but i would n't trade this experience for the world . sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger-- you think i 'm a big dork do n't you ? 
yeah . i guess i do . 
we had fun . i even got along with talia-- for about three minutes . i do n't know why she hates me so much ... 
oh you know bosnia the importance of the right to vote ... 
i - unno ... don't worry i had everything on the hand memorized . 
it 's not my style okay ? 
betty your daydreams are a lot better than my realities believe me . i 'm afraid though it 's time to get your butt kicked . 
that 's bullshit . just shoot . 
do n't get cocky girl . 
do n't say that . 
i 'm really sorry i could n't make it to your birthday party last month . 
betty finn . gosh ..... 
you do n't deserve my fucking speech ! 
i have a little prepared speech i give when my suitor wants more than i 'd like to give him .... gee blank i had a nice .... 
hey really i do n't feel so great . 
jeez right then why do n't i do drugs ? 
ever since phil collins did that mtv anti - drug commercial i refuse everything . 
gee thanks . 
no not at all . brad you 're pretty enough to be one . 
i 'm sorry ? i do n't get it . 
i do n't know . this thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth . 
what are you talking about ? she hated you ! you hated her !   what are you smiling at ? 
oh i have to hear this . 
you 're beautiful . 
color me educated . i learned high school happiness is for members only pauline fleming would n't know reality if it lived in her uterus and reality 's name 's heather james . also j.d. 's a major creep . 
because you 're an idiot . 
i do n't know it was okay i guess . 
all right . 
because you 're an idiot . 
i do n't know it was okay i guess . 
all right . 
things are going to change earl . 
i just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it does n't have to be vietnam . you do n't get treated badly here do you ? 
something like that . will you do it ? 
what are you doing here ? ! 
heather ? wha ... 
we both said a lot of things we did n't mean last night . 
lick it up baby . lick . it . up . 
you goddamn bitch ! 
heather i feel awful like i 'm going to throw up . can we jam please ? 
crap . so who 's this brad guy i 've been set up with ? witty and urbane pre - lawyer or albino accountant ? 
never say never . 
geez do n't listen to them . 
we made a girl want to consider suicide . what a scream . what a jest . 
i 'm sorry ? what are you oozing about ? 
do n't tell me . crest would be stained with loserness . 
pretend you 're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims . 
does n't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you 're a pirahna ? 
i 'm sorry it 's just why ca n't we talk to different kinds of people ? 
i was talking with someone ! 
hey this question would n't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last ...... 
ouch .... the lunchtime poll . so what 's the question ? 
i 'll think about it . 
shit heather . i do n't have anything against martha dunnstock . 
heather my love there 's a new sheriff in town . 
yeah i just got back . 
heather why ca n't you just be a friend ? why are you such a megabitch ? 
do n't talk to me like that . 
people love you but i know you . jennifer forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria . and doug hylton ... 
just shut up and turn on the radio . hot probs is on . 
you 're not funny . ouch ! 
i said i was sorry . 
is she dead ? 
yes . yes . we 'll work something out . i swear to god . wo n't we j.d.? ... j.d. ? 
well you better move holden out of the way or he 's going to get spewed . 
maybe you should see a doctor . 
okay i 'm going i 'm going . jesus ... 
hey now if you were happy every day of your life you would n't be a human being you 'd be a game show host . 
if everyone jumped off a bridge young lady would you ? 
you 're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in u.s. fucking a today . that 's got to be the least private thing i can think of . 
what were < u > you</u > trying to do ? sleep ? 
so did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight ? 
hea < u > ther</u > i 've got something going with j.d. 
mourning . maybe watch some t.v. why ? 
uh - huh . 
watch it heather . you could actually be digesting food . 
give it up girl ! 
give me the clipboard . 
oh sure pilgrims indians tater tots ; it 's a real party continent . 
what 's your damage heather ? you ruined my ... 
i thought i ... you .. 
you know what i want babe ? 
the bomb asshole ! 
how do you turn the fucker off ? 
it 's all over j.d. help me to stop it . 
okay okay . i knew that . i knew that . put your hands on your head . 
like father like son . a serious - as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that 'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs . okay so let 's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground . 
no - o ! 
tomorrow someone else will move into her place . that person could be me .   ha there 's only one of us who knows heather 's handwriting and if you think i 'm doing another suicide note . 
i think i know heather a bit better than you okay ? if she was going to slash her wrists the knife would be absolutely spotless . 
this knife is filthy . 
you 're still not listening ! i 'm not .. 
wait a .... you're not listening ! i 'm not on your side .... 
get off my bed you sick psycho ! you think you 're a rebel ! you 're not a rebel ! you 're a sick psycho ! do you think you 're a rebel ? do you think you 're a rebel ? i wanna know ! 
it 's over j.d.   over ! 
i was thinking more along the lines of slitting heather duke 's wrists open and making it look like a suicide . 
i 'm going to make this ms. pauline thing work . lines of communication between the cliques . you were a phase .... 
you 're getting too cool for me j.d. i do n't know how to talk to you . 
we 're breaking up . i am out ! 
may < u > be</u > . 
let 's just ... settle down . ms. fleming has given us a chance to atone for ... 
you can be so immature ! 
do n't < u > even</u > talk about that stuff ! 
you shoulda stuck around jerk . ms. fleming wants to redefine the high school experience . 
ca n't you see this is a special moment ? 
your son 's dead and you love him . 
sure . can we make an ice run before the funeral ? 
did not . 
did not . 
i did not want them < u > dead</u > . 
we killed them did n't we ? 
kurt does n't look too good . 
yeah but do n't worry it was worth it just to see the look on .... 
oh you 're so smart . how about a little heterosexuality before we go ? 
oh come < u > on</u > . lots of people drink perrier . it 's come a long way . 
you must have had fun . 
neat . let 's try it out on j.f.k. 
we do n't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent . why would the germans invent a bullet that does n't kill people ? i mean it < u > was</u > world war two not a school play . 
ram and i died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world . the joy we shared in each other 's arms was greater than any touchdown . yet we were forced to live the lie of sexist- beer guzzling - jock - asshole . 
first tell me this similarity is not incredible . 
so it looks like the person 's been shot and killed when they 're really just unconscious and bleeding . 
you ca n't be serious ? hey listen my bonnie - and - clyde days are over . 
i do n't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we 'll just be shooting them with blanks . 
so what ? do n't smile like that jesus ! 
i 'm doing a favor for heather . a double date . i tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off . 
my mom 's making my favorite meal tonight . spaghetti . lots of oregano . 
yeah . scary stuff . 
next channel darling . 
that 's good . have you done this before ? 
i can do heather 's handwriting as well as my own . 
like a suicide thing ? 
it 's one thing to want somebody out of your life . it 's another thing to serve them a wake - up cup of drano . 
stop kidding around . i 'm going to have to send my s.a.t. scores to san quentin instead of stanford . 
same difference . oh jesus i 'm gon na ... 
no shit sherlock . i ca n't believe it . i just killed my best friend . 
you 're not funny . 
no luck ? well milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely . quite nicely . 
milk and orange juice . hmmmm . maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something . 
what are you < u > doing</u > ? you just ca n't go ..... besides she 'd never drink anything that looks like that . 
o - kay . we 'll cook up some soup and put it in a coke . sick eh ? now should it be chicken - noodle or bean - with - bacon ? 
do n't be a dick . that stuff'll kill her . 
trust me . she skips the saturday morning trip to grandma 's even when she 's not hungover . 
but before that i 'd like to see heather chandler puke her guts out . 
i know exactly what the hell you 're talking about and you 're right you do n't know what the hell you 're talking about . let 's just grow up be adults and die . 
there 's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm . 
hey it was good for me too sparky . 
well then i 'll pray for rain . 
killing her wo n't solve anything . 
now blah - blah - blah is all i do . i use my grand i.q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew . some genius . 
you 're welcome . it 's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor 's swing set . 
it 's like they 're just people i work with and our job is being popular and shit . 
it 's not perfect . i do n't really like my friends . 
sure i 'm on my way to a party at remington university . 
time out .... jason dean . your pop 's fred dean construction . must be rough . moving place to place . 
i do n't know . should you ? 
i did n't . cherry . 
really ? that thing in the caf today was pretty severe . 
no but if you 're nice i 'll let you buy me a slurpee . you know your 7 - 11speak pretty well . 
how very . 
if you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they 're blowing us up in two days what would you do ? 
all we want is to be treated like human beings not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized . 
everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about joey blow . when that news reporter gets home he 'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern . 
this condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do . hey kids make your parents and teachers feel like shit ! get the respect in death you 'll never get in life . 
greate pate but i 'm going to have to motor if i want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow . 
may < u > be</u > . 
great pate but i 'm going to have to motor if i want to be ready for the party tonight . 
may < u > be</u > . there 's kind of a dark horse now in the running . 
i guess . 
get a job . 
where is he ? where 's j.d. ? 
but ms. fleming it 's just not right . 
heather was cool but cruel . the good looks and bad manners gave her power but it could not give her happiness . 
it 's all yours heather . now if you 'll excuse me i 'm going to go throw up . 
the world wants winners i guess . not people stained with loserness . 
i 'm so sorry . i was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering . 
but my name 's not ... 
that 's three things . 
actually mr. rieper . . . it 's a novel and we 'll be sending it to new york . that 's where all the big publishing houses are based . 
are you a carpenter mr. rieper ? herbert shakes his head . 
i adore anything to do with the arts . 
i 'm not sure . . . but it 's proving to be very popular ! 
but you 're not fat mrs. rieper ! 
thank you . i bought it especially mrs. rieper . 
ca n't you stay a bit longer paul ? 
i 'm sorry mrs. rieper . i 'm feeling quite fatigued . 
i 'm saving them for a rainy day . 
i 'm the matron 's favourite patient and she 's shown me her special stitch ! 
thank you so much ! 
i 'm so happy to see you ! 
oh no . . . mummy 's awfully good at it . 
well actually mummy 's left that programme now . . she 's far too busy with the marriage guidance council . 
and so in a blazing fury charles runs lancelot trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving deborah free to accept charles 's proposal of marriage ! 
is n't it beautiful ! 
goodbye mr. rieper . 
i think she knows what 's going to happen . . . she does n't appear to bear us any grudge ! 
your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . is n't she ? 
all right then . 
yes . . . 
but that 's not true ! i 've got one . 
do n't worry gina ! mummy and daddy love each other . 
too right . . . but he does n't have a show ! nobody gets into mother 's draws except daddy ! 
poor mother was completely taken in . 
that was what we were led to believe . . . 
that 's great ! we 'll have the fare in no time ! 
this lot 's got to be worth 50 quid ! 
they 'll blame the bloody housekeeper . she nicks stuff all the times ! 
i know i 'll lean forward and show more cleavage ! 
hurry up ! i 'm freezing ! 
you mean travel by ourselves ? 
no you 're not gina - it 's everybody else who is bonkers ! 
how do you know ? did he tell you ? 
that idiot boarder ? 
what ? ? 
i could n't have done it without you charles . 
i shall call him diello . 
it 's so beautiful ! 
god yes ! 
to be known as he ! 
james will be there . . . and mario ! only they 'll be saints . 
i 'm not ! i 'm going to the fourth world ! it 's like heaven only better because there are n't any christians . 
daddy says the bible 's a load of bunkum ! 
do n't . . . please ! please do n't ! 
of course it matters ! it 's mario ! 
0h god . . . i 'm so sorry ! 
somebody 's got to help us ! 
well . . . i better make myself a bit more presentable . 
breaks down into heavy sobs . 
she says juliet 's in a terrible state . . . 
i 've just had hilda hulme on the phone . 
is it hurting dear ? 
frowns at henry . 
yvonne has n't been herself either . locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing . 
pops a couple more potatoes on pauline 's plate . herbert glances at pauline . 
i 've booked you in for a chest x - ray . . . just to be on the safe side . 
whips off her pinny as herbert leads juliet into the dining room . 
and pauline hurriedly work together setting out plates and cutlery . 
come on ! sausage rolls . 
i 'll think you 'll find our mr. bayliss is not keen on seafood . i 've got lamb chops in the ' frigerator . 
playfully shoves his hand away . 
looks down at the ground in front of her . 
oh no . i 'm watching my figure . 
that 's enough yvonne ! 
love you can still write to each other . 
stands and walks toward the door . 
you 're not going anywhere . you 're 15 years old ! ! 
do n't be so ridiculous . you 're our daughter you belong here with us . 
open this door ! 
all right ! you go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way ! 
you 're rude . . . rude and insolent ! i do n't see why i should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer . 
is very angry . 
these stories are not going to get you school certificate ! you do n't seriously think anyone 's going to publish them ? 
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile . 
you 're failing english . . . you used to be top of the class- pauline i 'm doing my own writing ! 
i care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education . 
she says the standard of your work is slipping . at this rate she does n't think you 'll get school certificate . 
it 's a letter from the school . . . from miss stewart . 
steps back . 
whirls around and slaps pauline on the cheek . 
my god what a disgrace you are ! you shame me you shame the family . you 're nothing but a cheap little tart ! 
grabs pauline by the shoulders . 
if you think for one minute that your father and i will tolerate this sort of behaviour you 've got another thing coming ! you 're only 14 ! ! ! you 're a child ! what on earth 's the matter with you yvonne ? you know what can happen with boys . . . do n't you have any self - respect ? 
from now on you 're sleeping in the house where we can keep an eye on you . 
her parents wo n't be going overseas now . . . they 'll have to cancel their trip . do n't worry about juliet . 
juliet 's infectious . . . she 'll be going to hospital . 
holds up a loaded fork . pauline reluctantly takes it . 
you may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl but i have n't ! 
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to pauline . 
you 've got to eat yvonne . you hardly touched our dinner . i 'm not having you falling ill . 
come on sit up . 
comes in with a breakfast tray : bacon and eggs tea and toast . 
leads a young man - john - into the dining room . 
glows with pride . steve is emptying his pockets on the bench . honora pats steve 's hand . 
well ? tell us ! how 'd it go ? 
i put on a lot of weight over christmas . 
oh ! i 'll pop them in a bowl . 
turns around and juliet presents her with a brown paper bag . 
is bending down pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven . both girls look at honora silently . 
oh - what a nice outfit ! 
hello juliet . juliet take off her jacket . 
stands and picks up her handbag . pauline stands and juliet grabs her hand . 
we do n't want to tire you out dear . 
looks startled at the outburst . 
i know it 's hard for you being in here but it is for the good of your health . 
gives her a sympathetic look . 
that 's coming along well ! 
it 's best not to get too close . juliet 's still not a hundred percent . hello juliet ! we 've bought you some fruit . 
hurries over . 
i would n't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger ! 
i 've heard your mother on 3ya . the woman 's session has lots of lively debate . 
and herbert exchange a glance . honora smiles at juliet . 
look mother ! 
you have it . 
i bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom and they have to pretend to be on some mountain ! 
i felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide . life seems so much not worth the living death such an easy way out . 
you have to let me go ! 
i belong with deborah ! we 're going to south africa ! 
the hulmes will look after me . they want me to live with them ! 
  i 'm bloody dressing as fast as i can for god 's sake ! 
i do n't wanna be in bloody school ! 
what do you know ? you would n't know the first thing about writing . you 're the most ignorant person i 've ever met ! 
i 'm educating myself ! 
who cares ! 
what does old stew want ? 
my name is gina ! 
you ran off with dad when you were only 17 ! nana parker told me ! 
well i guess i take after you then ! 
can i go now ? 
i had a nasty foreboding feeling at first but now i realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture . 
but she 'll have no one to look after her ! 
do you think juliet could stay here while her parents are away ? 
i just want to be on my own for a while . 
i 'm not hungry . 
i spent a wretched night . it would be wonderful if i could get tuberculosis too . 
he 's the manager ! 
  got an a mum ! 
let 's go for a walk down here . . . come on mummy ! 
bye dad . 
i thought for hours about whether carmelita should accept bernard 's marriage proposal . . . 
it 's a three - act story with a tragic end . 
let 's go upstairs deborah . i wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night . 
i know what to do about mother . 
i 'm coming with you . 
i need my sodding parents ' consent . 
poor father . . . 
do you think bloody bill 's trying to get into her draws ? 
i thought he was supposed to be terribly ill . 
i can try my father 's safe . i 'm sure i can get the keys to his office . 
i 'm sure they 'll notice things missing . 
just a couple more . . . 
stay still or they 'll be blurry . . . 
let 's go overseas . . . 
i think i 'm going crazy . 
well . . . no . but it 's so obvious . 
john has fallen in love with me ! 
you 'll never guess what 's happened ! ! 
you 're such an incredible woman . 
what ? ? ? 
he flings open the door and launches himself at the bed ravishing her ! 
that . . . 
this . . . 
him . . . 
he . . . 
saint mario ! 
but we 're all going to heaven ! 
i wish james would do a religious picture . . . he 'd be perfect as jesus ! 
i think i 'm dying . . . 
it does n't matter . 
she 's terribly hurt . . . 
trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss . everybody does things they regret . you just could n't remember doing these things and now you are so it 's a shock to the system . i 'm telling you . you will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife 's death . 
just get better okay ? 
no you do n't understand . that 's why i 've been fighting to get you better . so you would n't be a patient anymore . 
if it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control i had . trevor i never date patients . 
no . but at one point you did repeat something though . a phrase . you must have been having this recurring dream you just kept saying this one thing over and over 
trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming . so practically everything say is going to sound strange . 
sure plenty of times . 
do n't tell me . kirsty used to smoke ? 
oh i knew about the chairs already . this is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes . 
you were unfaithful it sounds like your confessing . 
i understand i think . other women ? 
you just made that up . 
eighty third most common . 
second most common ? 
okay mr. statistics i 've got one for you . what 's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen ? 
okay so ... what 's the safest place ? 
i 'm stumped . 
all finished . 
i know my bedside manner 's horrendous . 
of course yes . 
you 're one tough cookie trevor gooding . you keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round . 
i 'm all over it . 
well trevor ? what have you got to say for yourself ? que pasa ? 
shh . do n't blame yourself trevor . please . 
well that 's not necessarily a bad thing is it ? 
you need to get better first trevor . way better .   it 's okay to miss somebody . it 's okay to still love someone after they 're gone . but you 've got to quit blaming yourself okay ... ? okay ? 
easy there trevor . you need to relax . 
no wisdom no insight no plan . 
that ` poor me ' attitude does n't suit you trevor . listen i do n't mean to sound like pollyanna but things could be worse . there 's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life . everything is new and exciting like your seeing it for the first time . you might see things a litlle differently from now on . 
well ? what do you say trevor ? que pasa ? 
you came in for your eeg . you fell asleep and well i took the liberty of ... i'm sorry . you looked like a wreck trevor . 
your wife ... ? 
it 's the morphine trevor . you 're on so much of it you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open . 
still hallucinating as well . hmm ... 
trevor i 've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother 's . this poor kid 's going to be starting preschool as student x if we do n't make up our minds . so i 've been thinking what about daisy ? 
yes . now go back to sleep . you 're driving the rest of the way to gramma 's remember ? 
it 's okay it was just a nightmare that 's all . 
for me ? trevor ! how romantic ! come here you . 
i only married you for your body . 
and besides i thought to hell with it ... it 's okay if you only married me for my money . 
there is no wisdom no insight no plan 
never to put you in my will . 
you know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day ? 
the best business decision if you ever made i 'll bet . 
how does feel to be mr. kirsty hughes for a whole year . 
oh my god trevor ! it hurts ! !   oh my god oh my god . trevor it 's coming out . 
the baby is coming out ! i can feel it ! sonofabitch it hurts ! ! aaagggghhh ! ! ! 
oh my god . it 's coming out . 
roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives ' first pregnancy . 
you 've been cheating on me have n't you ? 
i 'm ... i 'm doing a very special thing here . and you ca n't even ... respond ? 
if what i 've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time . besides we 've got a whole seven minutes before the next one . clock 's ticking . tick - tock ... 
you win ! okay pull over . 
uh ... eighty two ? 
shut up and play darling . your turn . 
uh i know you 're having financial difficulties mister laplante but i wonder if ... i mean the money i loaned you ... 
i think you should visit your son . and try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job .   you need to create the impression of a responsible decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once . 
it 's november . 
how recently ? 
i understand .   how often do you see your son ? 
are you pretty involved in his upbringing ? 
and a son by your ex - wife ?   joseph . 
we can hope .   you still have your job right ? 
i think our best course right now would be to focus on the probation officer 's report ... 
i got your bail continued . 
mister laplante ... bernie ... i ... just for a few moments ... i want to be a human being not a reporter . i 'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and i looked up and some man came out of the smoke his face smeared with mud and soot and ... and he ... saved my ... life . off the record .   was it you ?   why would you deny it if it was ? because you took my purse ?   why ? 
was it you ?   in the plane ?   who saved my life ? 
in all that smoke and fire john had a moment of weakness .   he 'd been down and out destitute living in his car .   it was just an impulse stealing my purse . 
you think i have n't figured it out ? just because the cops are n't on to you yet does n't mean you 're home free .   i 'm a veteran reporter .   i 've seen your kind before the underbelly of crime . 
a lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet ...   blackmailing a national hero ... 
he had one < u > tiny</u > uncharacteristic moment of weakness .   that 's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime ... 
yes everybody < u > is</u > in love with john bubber .   the whole country in fact . and they 're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money - grubbing low - life fence ... 
if anything happens to john bubber mister laplante i 'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law . 
here !   here ... ten thirty fifty bucks .   how much have you got chucky ?   give mister laplante your money . 
if you 're not in the car in ten seconds i 'll have the cops pick you up . 
for god 's sake tell him i 'm on my way .   let 's go chucky .   a police escort is gon na pick us up en route .   you too laplante . 
what 's your scheme mister laplante ? what are you forcing john bubber to do ?   what are you -- ? 
how did you acquire this mister laplante ? 
camera chucky .   are you bernard laplante sir ?   what is your relationship with john bubber ? 
no john you 're too hard on yourself .   i 've got the creep here the guy who 's ... 
john i know all about it . 
it 's no big deal it just < u > looks</u > better carrying me .   oh you mean because i was n't carrying my purse at the time . 
i just remembered .   you were talking about bodybuilding and swearing . 
there like that .   kind of uh sexy .   you can support me anytime john . 
you 're doing fine .   you did n't actually lift me though .   it was more like you supported me . 
now you help me up .   boy you seem ...   taller .   it must be psychological ...   now that i know you saved my life ... 
read it .   it 'll be fine . 
you were ... very ... inspiring . 
goodnight john . 
i know the truth john .   i 'm flying in some guys from your unit in vietnam tomorrow .   interviewing them live on network hookup ! 
no i do n't have the right .   you 're a < u > news</u > < u > story</u > ! 
you did save my life !   and it 's < u > me</u > ! i 'd be taking advantage of < u > you</u > ! i 'm a reporter john an experienced professional ...   i ... 
i ... i know that john ... 
years ?   there are going to be lots of ... opportunities . 
uh if you could just uh support uh a small airfield ... 
john i 'm sure she could support just about anything .   i think i 'll see you to your room . a sort of bodyguard .   make sure no harm comes to you . 
you 're a celebrity john .   people are going to want to please you ... or use you ... or both . 
... unworthy of the adoration .   we all do . 
instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody .   < u > you've</u > known john bubber all your life you 're used to him you know you 're the same human being you were before all the excitement .   so you feel like a fraud ... 
all the adulation ?   it makes you feel like a fake does n't it ? 
you were saying you do n't want a million dollars . 
and sold it to mister laplante the fence who 's now trying to blackmail poor john . 
the ... silver ... mike ... award ! 
this sofa is a lethal weapon .   the springs ... are ... the springs ... what ... ? 
you 're lucky chucky you ... ow ! 
maybe maybe not .   i have a feeling this guy is important somehow . 
what 're we talking about ?   reach out for what ? 
did you get it ?   jesus did i say that ? 
he 'll do it .   you really - should have talked to him first . 
there could be problems with something like that mister wallace . what if ... ? 
you said all the passengers were accounted for ... 
would the station put me up at a good hotel ... ? 
the story behind the story the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire the dirt you mean . 
you just ca n't bear the idea of good news . 
i have n't won it yet .   i notice you 've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony . 
i said i wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him . 
i did n't say i thought we should have saved him .. 
hello mister wallace . 
hi chief .   you like the suicide ? 
i wonder if you 'd mind if we waited for him here mister winston ... 
should n't we have buzzed him to let him know -- 
we could n't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox but ... 
we 're from channel four yes .   we 'd like to find -- 
reporters ... have to ... rise above their hormones . 
do n't be ridiculous .   i 'm a reporter . 
he 's pretty ... remarkable . 
look at the guy !   he just saved fifty people .   now he 's going to disappear . who is he ? 
nobody stole my credit cards .   they burned up in the crash .   which reminds me did you get me cash ? and what about the reservations ? 
call him back .   ask him .   i 'm a little ... busy . 
what about ? 
mr. sykes i think you should go home . 
about what ? 
yeah right -- i really have to go to bed . 
listen i 'm sorry but it 's really late -- you do n't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor . 
uh huh . 
can i tell you tomorrow ?   i think i ... 
yeah i 'm okay -- it 's been a long night . 
not me i fell for it right down the line .   be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales .   he married me because i was pretty . 
it 's nice that you can make that choice . 
you must value your independence . 
do you have a family ? 
i bet .   going into people 's homes . 
i apologize for that scene with my husband .   you must have overheard . 
oh that 's fine . 
so you 're just kind of a roving -- 
everything breaks at once . 
do you do washing machines too ? 
oh great . 
well can i make an appointment ? 
oh well do you fix refrigerators ? 
it 's okay baby the police are coming . 
well what do you want me to do rita -- i ca n't just forget fifteen years of marriage .   well of course i know < u > you</u > can .   no rita i -- what was that ?   -- oh i thought i heard something on the line . 
holly -- that 's not so . 
yes he did and i do n't like it any more than you do . 
well that 's what happens with grownups too . 
you know how sometimes neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him ? 
your daddy and i are kind of mad at each other right now so we have to spend some time apart . 
a man ?   was it a dream ? 
it 's the middle of the night sweetie . 
aw okay . 
baby what is it ? 
hey .   have a nice time -- it 's a good school . 
rita he 's only twelve years old 
i 've tried to get him to agree to one .   i just -- i do n't know ... i 'm getting such weird vibes lately . 
the same thing -- his business pressures the whole move and everything .   he 's frantic about nailing this new job worried about screwing over his present boss . 
i 've asked him what 's wrong . 
no i told you .   a whiff of perfume on his shirt . 
yeah .   there 's still a lot i want to do .   it 's not quite ... the kids are n't really settled in yet . even the dog has been terribly high - strung and whines a lot since we 've been here .   look he has n't even come in for his food today . 
do you want me to come up and tuck you in ? 
honey do you want some hot chocolate ? 
neil -- what -- 
he 's staying with a friend .   hurry up now you 'll be late for school . 
neil you could have burned the house down ! 
the pocket 's a cinch -- i 'll sew it up for you after dinner okay ? 
i think we got it just in time before the ink dried . 
he does n't have a temperature . 
no honey i have n't seen him . did n't you feed him this morning ? 
here take this out to the table . 
because you 'd have to get up at five a.m. would you like that ? 
c'm on kids let 's go . 
we 'll talk in the morning . 
oh god . 
no philip i do n't want you coming back here .   and if you want to talk to me -- < u > call</u > . 
that 's not a decision for you to make on your own . 
there 's always an excuse is n't there ? 
philip what are < u > you</u > doing here ? 
i 'm having the floor fixed 
you 're even sadder and more burnt- out than i thought . 
boy you really buckle under a little pressure do n't you ? 
that 's not the case . 
honey it 's not the end of the world .   you 'll call lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix - up .   and if he 's not interested anymore then you 'll find another company to go to maybe even your own .   you are free now you are independent . 
honey -- i ca n't find those large- size hefty trash bags ! 
oh honey . 
honey ?   how did it go ?   you did n't call me . 
i think you should feel like dancing at a time like this . 
oh baby . 
philip !   the senior partner ? 
did she water this plant ?   it looks a little bent out of shape . 
yeah -- she did a good job .   this glass looks brand - new . 
did you lock the garage door ? 
where should i hide the car keys ? 
i thought we 'd be happy here . 
fuck you philip . 
there < u > are</u > people who do things because they < u > want</u > to get caught . 
i do n't care philip .   you want to go chasing barbara zelman go ahead .   just watch out for those buck teeth . 
well what about < u > these</u > ?   do you usually put your < u > carbons</u > in your pocket too ? ! 
i < u > remember</u > what day you wore that jacket .   it was < u > monday</u > .   the day you were all day in < u > meetings</u > again ?   and had to send out for < u > sandwiches</u > ? 
no i 'm not kidding you < u > philip</u > . 
someone nice will find him if he gets lost . 
i know someone else who 's sensitive . 
neil 's still having a bad time at school .   i feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time . 
how long does it have to be a new house ? 
i hear things in this house 
there 's no card or anything . 
do you remember who gave us this ? 
well did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job ? 
how was your lunch with charlie ? 
how was lunch ? 
it 's just a dumb game they play . you want to be at a bigger firm get used to the politics . 
honey the meeting today is going to be fine .   do n't get in an uproar . 
honey are you okay ? 
< u > now</u > neil .   stop teasing your sister . 
we 're going to think about it . 
what if someone else buys it in the meantime ? 
and it 's a shorter commute . 
you could have a pool to cool off in . 
they do n't expect to get what they 're asking .   let 's make an offer . 
but it 's what we want . 
i know it 's at the high end of our range -- 
this -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us . 
you 're thinking exactly what i thought when i first saw this house 
i hear what you 're saying but i know what you 're thinking . 
neil do n't leave the back doors open -- i do n't want holly near the pool . 
two -- three if you count the husband . 
oh space !   -- you said the right thing . 
this is a terrific entrance hall what a welcoming feeling . 
just reduced . 
because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings . 
it 's been on the market a while has n't it ? 
well technically it 's not mid evil - - it 's renaissance . 
they appear to be authentic . 
my name is jennifer hillman .   i 'm an archaeologist .   i read in the paper about the murder yesterday and i thought i should come talk to you . 
lieutenant bedsoe ? 
paul .   i thought we agreed .   no press . 
you guys are from the british museum right ? 
electro magnetic soundings indicate we 've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber . 
sounds very -- normal . 
what now ? 
be careful conner . 
he 's in there ! 
must you fight him ? 
where will you go now ? 
and the other one -- he is like you ? 
how did you know that ? 
on the back it has-- 
would you like to see it ? 
not unless they 're immortal . 
--for three hundred years . 
yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they were n't ?   what if they were trying to get out ? 
why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern ?   they were wedged in tight .   they could n't get a grip on them .   they would have had much more strength pushing on them . 
let me ask you something else .   at the excavation site in scotland the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed .   the day we found the body someone had moved the rocks making a hole in the collapsed section .   what bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall . 
because i do n't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty - eight hours . 
--the calan .   do you know who they are ? 
yes -- it is . 
a little -- yes .   my interest in coming here is profession . 
how come you wanted to meet tonight ? 
you 're not an easy person to get to know . 
i 'm just trying to place you . 
you have an interesting accent . where are you from ? 
you did n't answer my question . 
you 're twenty minutes late . 
you look like you have . 
have you ever heard of the calan ? 
it probably would n't interest you . it 's something i read in a mythology book . 
you talk to me -- but you do n't answer my questions .   i guess i 'll have to talk to lieutenant bedsoe . 
do you always walk around with a sword ? 
then how did he know your name ? 
who was that man last night ? 
why do you stare at me like that ? 
then who 's russell nash ? 
what 's going on ?   why did he call you macleod ? 
you 're hurt . 
it 's mine .   it 's been in my family for years .   it belonged to my great great great grandmother . 
why ?   what 's going on ? 
if it 's good advice . 
why do i feel that you know what 's going on ? 
bullet proof vests do n't bleed . 
i do n't think so -- but then maybe you 've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the first national bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out ? 
yes .   how did you know ? 
yes .   we found another man outside a site we were working at in scotland . 
to talk to you . 
no .   i 'm an archaeologist . 
i was wondering if i could talk to you ? 
my name is jennifer hillman .   i was at the police station earlier today-- 
we 'll see . 
i like my work . 
i know paul . 
i was working on the cataloging . 
and this ? 
i do n't think it is a duplication . 
his head .   someone cut it off . 
we found him this morning . 
i do n't know . 
he 's fine .   he swears he never left his post for a moment .   he heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside . 
someone broke into the cavern last night . 
we 're holding the workers down below . 
then we should n't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning .   this could be a very important find .   i want it documented . 
where is the film crew from the british museum ? 
oh my babies . 
what 's wrong ? 
please do not talk like this . 
what sort of plan ? 
we are almost out of water . 
paul ! then another voice . 
let me go . children get off . 
no ! sit down now . 
ask them to wait a little longer . for the twins . 
a little longer paul ? 
please please try one more time . 
i will not leave without the twins . 
a volkswagen ! 
i want to know . 
what sort of car ? 
tell me what it was . 
what was the bribe ?   what am i worth to you ? 
in ruhengeri ? 
i hear we must pay for everything . how much for this ? 
please paul why do we have to go to the roof ? 
you can not go alone . 
no no . 
go out ! where ? 
what 's the matter ? 
so where is the lamb ? 
what for paul . 
your card says hutu . take our children go and get the twins pay money at the roadblocks . get them out . please . 
you could leave paul . 
but who is left ? 
what about us ? 
my sister is dead paul . they would not leave the children . 
please go back bring the children to us . 
he needs to be in a safe place .   have you heard from mr. garindi ? 
no odette says he 's in shock . 
no answer . please send someone to get them please . 
it will do just fine . 
i will not have them on my conscience . they will stay in my room . 
what are you going to do ? you can not drive them out onto the road . they can stay with me . 
paul do n't let them die . 
what is it paul . 
oh my god ! 
please paul ' til first light . 
please . let them stay ' til morning . the militia will not come here they know you are a hutu with influence . 
they came through the bushes over the wall . what could i do ? 
i tried already . the phones do not work . 
where are thomas and fedens ? 
the president has been murdered . 
paul ! paul 's eyes adjust he recognizes many of his neighbors all crowded into this small room . then he sees their friends odette and her husband jean baptiste . 
they do not have your connections . 
victor was not a stranger he was our neighbor . 
you could have asked for a favor . 
why did n't you call your contacts in the army ? 
we must do something . 
call your friends in the army . call someone . victor is harmless . this is a mistake . 
do something . 
simon next door the charingas ' boy . 
of course . 
he wants your wisdom . 
yes with fedens and the children . 
i asked odette to take a look at little anais . she has a rash . 
okay : this may sound crazy but -- 
but they did n't see it happen they still have doubts . what we need is another body and steven 's bloody hands right next to it ! 
-- but nobody has yet donald . they just have n't been brought to that breaking point . they have to believe proof - positive that their lives are in danger . 
-- the whole thing is falling apart ! 
-- there 's plenty : for all we know steven 's got her spying on us right now -- 
so we do n't even know if she 's alive or dead -- 
-- there 's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan . you ever find out what happened to melissa marr ? 
so what stopped her ? 
-- the james dean wannabe with the hair trigger -- 
and what 's steven 's status ? 
you 're the doctor sweetheart . ' guess the atropine worked then . 
no need for divorce and that messy division - of - assets thing when they kick before you do . 
oh he 's got no problem with that : i 'm his fourth . 
take a bow steven you 've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me . 
steven ? ? 
no . ohmygod pritchett was right -- the house < u><b > is</b></u > haunted . 
-- wit ... nesses -- 
-- what ... are ... you ... going ... to -- 
funky little house ai n't it ?   friends your hostess is now going to retire for what 's left of the night . if you need me i 'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need : the door'll be locked i 'll be trying to sleep and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole i 'm gon na empty this thing into their fucking head . thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have . 
question answered . 
-- thank you ! all the cards finally on the goddamn table ! 
-- oh for chrissake that 's a given ; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here -- 
-- and who 's next on your list ? 
i mean did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch -- 
game set and match steven . you 've outdone yourself . and i know it 's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it but inquiring minds are desperate to know : just what did really happen to ms. marr ? 
stalking the wild poltergeist . 
fine with me . just somebody then better go and round up melissa marr . 
and where are we off to mr. price ? check the wiring on the animatronic mummies ? 
so how 's a girl to know if these things are loaded baby ? 
must be getting old stevie -- you 're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set - up you used for the son - of - sam hunt back in ' 94 .   girlie open up that casket there and see what you find . 
-- the sadistic prick -- 
really ? well let it rip . 
sure it was n't . hey anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies ? do n't raise your hands all at once . 
my guests were shredded . it 's your sick little scene now steven : enjoy . i 'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me and then i 'm calling a cab . 
you 're hurting me . 
which part of that fantasy turns you on most : me with other men -- or just the other men ? 
all accidents until proven otherwise . 
it you really loved me steven you 'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds . 
what are you talking about ? you think i invited them ? 
then who are they ? 
i guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you . well congratu - fucking - lations steven : round one you win . 
i gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they ? 
could we have a word ? 
have n't they already ? 
i 'm not laughing steven . 
do n't touch me ! 
c'm on . 
more the merrier . 
yeah ... something . 
-- uh excuse me just one quick question ? how long before this damn thing unseals itself ? 
looks like we 're it . 
i do n't do groups . 
yeah . and under other abnormal circumstances i think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones . 
all the plates sealing the windows and doors -- there 's got to be some way of raising them manually . they did n't just appear out of thin air -- there 's got to be pulleys cables or something that make them go up and down . 
no . it 's just trying to frighten us . 
the opening 's still too small we 'll never get through ! 
-- was that ? ? 
we 're safe ? 
he 's dead ... ? 
he 's got ta still be down here . 
it 'll have to do . 
what about that other guy ? 
or an on - line computer . 
everyone that was invited is related to one of the staff who was here when the place burned . there are five of us ... 
holy shit ! now we know how the guest list was made up . look these names ... head nurse ruth - ann stockard ... bjorn jensen electro therapy ... jasper marr thomas steven price ... they 're all here ! 
cheery looking bunch . 
maybe there are notes or drawings of this place showing how those plates work . 
let 's try down here ... 
back where ? 
-- listen to the man -- 
-- where the hell were you ? 
i was upstairs with eddie -- 
you 're starting to sound like pritchett . 
-- no . the basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing : big long iron levers just lying there -- 
it 's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop ! 
we can do it ... 
no -- keep pulling it 's moving ! 
an answer i hope : exactly what -- or who -- melissa was taping . 
hey if everybody 's gon na kill each other could you do it in another room ? i 'm trying to get something accomplished here . 
no ... not air -- 
there 's always exceptions . 
why not ? 
i told you already : jennifer jenzen executive v.p. of -- 
what ? deep down inside ? 
you need to get out more . 
this whole place ca n't be wired to just one circuit -- 
three steps forward -- i want to get up there . 
do n't push it . 
and you 're not really as large and useless as you seem . 
is she ... alright ? 
... wow .... wow ! hey ms. jenzen -- ? 
no no it 's just -- 
i was in the middle of -- 
messenger just dropped it off . no return address . 
i do n't know ms. jenzen . 
not even for a million dollars mr. price . 
do n't think so . stay the fuck back . 
-- no more -- 
-- confirming everything we already know -- 
i 'll take my chances . 
well i do n't . 
if you 've got a gun on you price i 'd hand it over now . 
i never saw you -- 
-- the window and door grates -- 
i ... don't think ... anybody should be touching the body . 
what is it ? ? 
good way to get your head blown off . 
this is all maybe getting a little too strange -- 
jennifer - jenzen - executive - v.p.- paragon - pictures . 
what 're you talking about ? 
yeah . why 's there five checks ? there 's only four of us . 
-- hey ! -- 
how he 's supposed to be dead ! 
pritchett : what is going on ? 
excuse me ? 
you coming or are you waiting for blackburn ? 
there is something very not normal going on here ! 
and you think it 's in there ? 
ghosts killed your father ? 
you should really open this place to the public pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives . 
well that leaves you with two options then does n't it : either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it 's spend - the - night - sleep - tight . 
no you do n't want to go down there . i am going down there . and i 'm going to find < u><b > reverse</b></u > on this thing and floor it . 
uh excuse me ? do n't think i 'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that 's your marriage -- but this is n't what i had in mind ... i want to know that we can get out of here if we need to . 
why not ? 
well then how 'bout maybe we call someone ? 
what 's going on ? 
of course he did for god 's sake .   did n't he mr. pritchett ? 
-- guess we know where mr. price is now . 
but the million bucks each that 's for real ? 
-- i 'm coming -- 
keep talking i 'll find you ! 
melissa it 's sara -- is that you ? 
melissa ... ? 
-- eddie ! ! 
i 'm ok mommy . 
what do you mean ?   mommy ? you 're scaring me ! 
h - how long will it take ? 
what about all my other stuff ? 
where are we going to go mommy ? 
are we leaving mommy ? 
i 'm scared ! 
she 's down ... 
she talks to me . 
it 's going to hurt us ! 
maybe it was colleen ... 
i did n't do anything mommy .

can we leave out a bowl of milk mommy ?

woah .   wait a minute .   who ?   the kid ? 
maybe not .   but you know more than i do . you know something about this box . something about a statue ? 
no .   he knows it wo n't .   it was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him does n't yet . 
every day . 
i do n't know his name ...   i saw the whole story .   a wounded bird was on his roof .   i could hear its cries from here . he went straight to it .   i could n't 've . i 'd be frozen between pity and fear . but he was n't .   its pain spoke directly to him .   he picked it up .   nursed it . fed it .   and it got better .   everyday he 'd watch the pigeon .   everyday the pigeon would watch him . i saw him learn . learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete . and one day just as afternoon became evening he leaned over opened the cage and walked away .   did n't look back .   but he heard the sound of its wings . 
... but it is good .   you know over to the left you can ... 
i do n't think so .   but it 's a fascinating subject .   did you ... 
no .   i buy them to impress people .   of course i 've read them . 
how have you ... ? 
the bank owns it .   but i 'm working on it . 
no !   no that 's ok .   i like to .   i love boiling water .   it 's a specialty of mine .   why do n't you go watch cartoons ? 
i 'll boil some water . 
right ... that 's ... er ... that 's nice of you terri .   can i ask ?   is it always this ... exploratory ?

guards come exactly every three minutes .... 
it does n't have to be .   everybody knows that if you mess with the kremlin you 'll end up in a siberian gulag eating your own fingernails . 
that was beautiful . 
hudson god 's given you a gift for cat burglary you can t just ... 
something like that . 
oh thank god you 're dead ... 
i 'm going to find out . 
you got it .   operation deflower mayflower is a bad joke and i 'm the punchline .   i thought we were using the cia to help us to get mayflower but really the cia was using me to keep us away from mayflower . 
a little petting is not the issue ! 
he came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure .   but he knew right and wrong .   oh and we kind of messed around ... 
i betrayed a man .   a good man .   an innocent man .   a thief . 
yeah .   the big e. 
no your eminence .   i think he 's going to steal the codex as early as next week . 
hudson i 'm afraid i 'm sticking with god .   but you 're a close second tough guy .   what is that smile ? 
holy sh - h -- things are going to get very interesting very fast . da vinci would be proud of you . 
wha -- you do n't want to know ... 
da vinci made the real directions in a secret script that i decoded . the way the machine is running now the gold will produce too quickly clog and the machine will shut itself down .   is n't it wonderful ? 
trust leonardo .... 
oh hudson i 'm a sister of the catholic church as well as an agent . 
oh hudson ... 
uh yeah .   guess i 'm a wee bit nervous .   i 'm sorry i could only score clergy passports . 
it 's that kind of selfish attitude that ... 
it 's from the machine .   all they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already .   we ca n't let that happen . 
where did you get this ? 
i - work - for - a - covert - vatican - humanitarian- organization .   the - cia - made - a - fool - of - me . i - care - for - you ... 
hudson do n't you understand ... 
oh i must have put too much ethyl - chloride in it . 
the c.i. what ?   god no ... 
what are your plans for the weekend ?   hoisting away the colosseum ?   tell me did the devil make you do it or did darwin and minerva mayflower ? 
you really went and did it .   with one day not even a day of planning you did it .   nobody does it better hudson .   you started the week stealing the sforza and you ended it swiping the codex . 
somebody robbed the vatican . 
it 's also been a long time for me .   i-- 
i 'm sorry .   i ca n't .   i .... 
oh i 'm so sorry ... 
what have you been doing ? 
how long were you in ? 
oh hudson i was worried you were n't going to drop by .... 
secret passageways do n't mean as much as they used to .   there 's a place two blocks east of here . enzo 's .   say 10:30 . 
i 'll bring my entire repertoire ... 
i do n't steal stuffed elephants from little girls .   and i buy my own clothes .   my life 's a little boring ... 
actually i wrote it .   it 's a good sentence .   it can apply to people . 
nice .   but right out of our brochure . 
delivers up to ten at night .   the pope has an obsession with his easter seals .   it 's actually not that an unusual set - up .   the secret passageway on the other hand .... 
sure hudson .   are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on dumbo ? 
come on this stuff will knock you out .   have you ever had the feeling you were being followed mr. bond . 
question sir ?    his untiring pen predicted the airplane the submarine the bicycle the helicopter and even the tank . 
as you know the da vinci codex has lived in the vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more . 
tough guy .   what are you -- how 's your head . 
thanks tough guy thanks a lot . why was the guard chasing you ? 
my god that was bold of you you did n't have to do that ... 
fantastic .   perfection .   the vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder . 
cat got his tongue ? 
when the mayflowers find out we have the codex they 're going to want to make a deal ... 
... hello ? 
i 'm plenty happy ! 
i 'm happy enough . 
well in connection with my job sometimes i have to go undercover as it were -- 
it 's hardly the same -- 
well maybe i -- 
why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president ? 
that smart ? ! 
so if you know everything about hudsucker tell me why the board decided to make norville barnes president . 
yeah yeah . say you wo n't tell anyone about me will you ? 
but -- who are you -- what d'you do here ? 
who are you ? how did you know who i am ? 
yeah and i 'll bet his initials are sidney j. mussburger ! 
but al it 's the bunk ! norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day i met him ! why buzz could n't have invented it -- look at the man -- he 's an imbecile ! 
i know they 're gon na buy that stock -- 
on norville barnes ! 
a sawbuck ! 
i 'm tellin ' ya this guy 's just the patsy and i 'm gon na find out what for . there 's a real story smitty some kind of plot a setup a cabal a -- oh and say did i tell ya ? ! 
yeah i was all wet about your idea man ... well thanks for being so generous ... it is human and you are divine ... no he 's no faker . he 's the 100 % real mccoy beware - of- imitations genuine article : the guy is a real moron -- 
i 'm telling you smitty the board of hudsucker is up to something -- 
and is this guy from chumpsville ? ! i pulled the old mother routine -- 
well that just about does it ! i 've seen norville barnes the young man in a big hurry and i 've seen norville barnes the self - important heel but i 've never seen norville barnes the quitter and i do n't like it ! 
just give me another chance norville -- i can help you fight this thing . i know this last story was a lie ! we can prove it ! we can -- 
norville i 'm sorry i ... i tried to tell you ... so many times ... it 's hard to admit when you 've been wrong . if you could just ... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance -- 
oh norville i -- 
consider this my resignation -- 
shutup ! -- after all ! you have n't talked to me for a week and now i 'm going to say my piece . i 've got a prediction for you norville barnes : i predict that since you 've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad you 're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you . you 're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a board that would n't give you the time of day if you ... if you ... 
shutup ! -- but then i figured out you were a swell guy a little slow maybe but a swell guy ! well maybe you 're not so slow but you 're not so swell either and it looks like you 're an imbecile after -- 
shutup ! -- and do n't think i have n't noticed how you 've changed . i used to think you were a swell guy -- well to be honest i thought you were an imbecile -- 
... i 've been watching you norville barnes even though you 've been trying to avoid me -- 
you 're awful kind to yourself norville barnes -- the fact is you 've slowed down sitting up here like a sultan not doing a lick of work ! why you know it 's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you have n't come up with one since the hoop and the reason 's plain to see ! you 've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it was n't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here ? ! 
your i -- 
you mean you know about this ? 
they 're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at hudsucker . why in new york alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work people with wives and children and families -- 
... you know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing ? 
never mind about that ... 
for pete 's sake norville ! 
sure norville sure ... 
oh norville -- 
yeah i think i 've heard of that . what goes around comes around . 
i wish it were that simple norville . i wish i was still a gazelle and you were an antelope or an ibex . 
norville there really is something i have to tell you -- 
oh i do n't know . maybe i was just a fast - talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys -- 
what a beautiful thought . 
... the people look like ants . 
well -- this year -- if it 's good i plan to make it a tradition . uh my it certainly is beautiful -- 
yes you can get carrot juice or italian coffee and the people there -- well none of them quite fit in . you 'd love it -- why do n't you come there with me -- they 're having a marathon poetry reading on new year 's eve . i go every year . 
uh -- yes . seventeen . yes i -- well no i -- i never really ... there 's a place i go now the cutest little place near my apartment in greenwich village . it 's called ann 's 440 . it 's a beatnik bar . 
oh yes ! in muncie ! 
... huh ? 
... certain people are -- 
norville you ca n't trust people here like you did in muncie ... 
i believe in you norville -- at least i believe in your ... intentions -- 
... you do ? 
norville ... there 's something i have to tell you . you see i 'm not really a secretary . 
... i 'm sorry . 
let me hold it or you 'll have a real shiner . 
let me look . 
... what happened ? 
maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance . 
oh is that it ! 
i 'm quite sure i do n't know what you mean . 
sure but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record ! 
well i do n't know ; maybe she does deserve it . maybe she should 've come in to face you man to man . 
... why do n't i just type this up ... 
well i -- 
i 'm sure i -- 
is that all mr. barnes ? 
-- or lack thereof ? 
well i ... did n't bother to read the article . i did n't think the picture did you justice . 
well i just do n't know how to thank you mr. barnes -- 
of course -- i went to the muncie uh secretarial polytechnic ! 
oh no really i -- 
why yes do you know it ? 
-- these were the values that were instilled in me while i was growing up in a little town you 've probably never heard of -- 
no thank you . seek and ye shall find work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education the ethics of my tender years -- 
a little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination a solid work ethic and an indomitable belief in the future -- 
at any rate i arrived in town not ten days ago full of dreams and aspirations anxious to make my way in the world -- 
what a horrible little person . 
i do n't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life ; it 's not a happy story ... 
the couch please . 
i 'm sorry we had to take the stairs . it was just that horrible little elevator boy ... 
i filed it yesterday . 
... on payday ! the only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you al . 
sez me ! amy archer . why is he an idea man -- because hudsucker says he is ? what 're his ideas ? why wo n't they let anyone interview him ? ... 
as a three - dollar bill . 
i tell ya the guy 's a phony . 
you 're fools both of you ! it 's obvious they 're out to crucify norville ! they 're trying to destroy him ! 
says who ? ! 
you ca n't print that ! 
it 's about a dimwitted editor who -- 
i 've got an even hotter story -- the sap from the city desk . 
i do n't know ... 
why not it 's all true ! the board is using this poor guy ! they 're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap ! 
yes miss betsy .   i mean that .   the houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to shango and damballa . 
no .   she was mindless but not like miss jessica .   but the houngan cured her . 
they even cure nonsense miss betsy .   mama rose was mindless .   i was at the houmfort when the houngan brought her mind back . 
at the houmfort . 
there are other doctors ... yes other doctors ... better doctors ... 
doctors that are people ca n't cure everything . 
things so bad nobody can help -- not even doctor maxwell . 
i do my best .   every day i dress her just as beautifully as if she was well .   it 's just like dressing a great big doll . 
she was very sick and then she went mindless miss. 
miss jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed with a lacy cushion to bank her head up . if you 'd only seen her miss connell . she looked so pretty . 
i know miss .   but i like to do it . i like to tend for miss jessica and i want to tend for you .   you settle right back now and i 'll mix you your coffee . 
i did n't want to frighten you out of your sleep miss.   that 's why i touched you farthest from your heart . 
good morning miss . 
are you trying to tell me that the houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure mrs. holland ? 
you mean mama rose was like mrs. holland ? 
that 's nonsense alma . 
doctors and nurses can only do so much alma .   they ca n't cure everything . 
looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- i do n't know whether i 'll be able to get away with it . 
what 's this ? 
we 'll see if we ca n't make her well alma you and i. 
she must have been beautiful .   what happened to her alma ? 
thank you alma . 
but i 'm miss jessica 's nurse alma . you do n't have to do that for me . 
thank you for waking me . 
but they came to a beautiful place did n't they ? 
you mean a figurehead . 
ti - misery ?   what 's that ? 
mrs. rand was at the houmfort that night .   but there 's nothing wrong with that .   she 's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people   to help them . 
mrs. rand ... 
that 's sweet of you mrs. rand . 
but you did n't have to come up here . 
but how did you get here ? what are you doing here ? 
but mrs. rand -- 
mrs. rand . 
i do n't mean believe like believing in a religion .   i mean do you believe it has power ?   do you think it could heal a sick person ? 
you do n't believe in it ? 
you 've never said anything about voodoo before mrs. rand . 
i 've no influence with mr. holland . 
i 'd love to . 
thank you mrs. rand .   i think you 're every bit as nice as wes says you are . 
believe me mrs. rand he does n't do this often . this is the first time i 've seen him -- 
oh mrs. rand -- 
i 'm afraid so . 
i would have stayed anyway dr. maxwell . 
i 've worked with it .   i 've seen cures . it is at least a hope . 
thank you . 
is this disease common in the tropics ? 
she can never be cured ? 
does she suffer ? 
but it 's so far away ... 
the west indies ? 
that will mean another interview wo n't it ? 
that is good .   but i 'd like to know more about the case . 
they did n't teach it at memorial hospital .   i had my suspicions though about the directress of training . 
at the memorial hospital -- here in ottawa . 
no wes . 
please wes do as i ask .   you must rest you must sleep . 
but she 's not dead wes . 
not to a nurse .   sleep is a cure . 
i do n't know .   i once asked dr. maxwell the same question .   he said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken . 
of course wes . 
i 'd like to go now rand .   would you mind taking me home ? 
that does n't sound like him . 
i wish i had n't heard -- 
do n't let it bother you so wes . 
wait . i want to listen . 
i 'm a nurse .   i always watch people when they pour something .   i watched ti - joseph and it was exactly two ounces . 
higher mathematics .   two ounces to a drink -- three drinks six ounces . 
it must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum . 
but do n't you have to work ? 
i was just beginning to wonder . are n't there shops restaurants and things ? 
it 's my day off . 
perhaps you ought to get on to the mill . 
i do n't know .   he spoke to me last night on the boat . i liked him very much . 
mr. holland ? 
of course .   it 's been nice of you to spend this much time with me . 
i wondered about your different accents .   i 'm still wondering about your names -- rand and holland . 
-- but you 're an american ? 
thank you .   but who sits there ? 
i like her already . 
is she a doctor ? 
yes -- on the boat . 
i guess i 'll wait until i 'm home mrs. rand . 
you want that ? 
that 's past -- that 's over and done with ... 
do n't paul -- do n't doubt yourself -- do n't make me doubt you . 
you wanted to warn me ... 
i can understand that .   everyone feels that way about someone . 
you ca n't believe that .   you do n't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad .   you 're not vicious or cruel paul . 
i still ca n't believe it paul -- that you would n't say a word in your own defense . 
she was beautiful . 
you know why .   you saw it the other night at the piano .   you turned away from me . 
i told you . 
i took mrs. holland to the houmfort .   i thought they might cure her . 
i wanted to help you . 
and instead   i came -- bringing you nothing . 
i imagined this so differently ... 
she is alive mr. holland -- that 's all . 
you did n't drive her mad . 
i love fort holland . 
i do n't know .   i wanted to help you . and now that i 'm here i do n't know how . 
i know what you went through tonight .   i kept thinking of what you said : that all good things died here violently . 
i heard you playing . 
you do n't seem very disturbed by it .   i 've always thought voodoo was something to be scared of : the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened . 
still i feel you should remove the decanter .   wes is not an alcoholic yet mr. holland . but as a nurse i can tell you that it wo n't be long before he is . 
but for wes -- it must be a temptation to him . 
yes he can .   but i 've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table -- 
well i had a good time up to a point . 
you must betsy . they 'll have to believe you . 
why betsy -- we ca n't lose you . you mean too much to us here . 
perhaps not .   but i did come here and i found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me . once started it seemed such an easy way to do good .   i should have known there was no easy way to do good betsy . 
-- and when my husband died i felt helpless . they disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse . all my husband 's dreams of good health good sanitation good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him .   then almost accidentally i discovered the secret of how to deal with them . there was a girl with a baby -- again and again i begged her to boil the drinking water . she never would . then i told her the god shango would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it . she boiled the water from then on . 
i asked you to let me explain . it 's a long story .   and not an easy one -- 
i knew you 'd come . and i knew i 'd have to come up here and talk to you . i could n't let you go back without any word . i came to tell you again -- jessica can not be cured . 
wait . do n't draw any conclusions . let me explain . 
her son drowned .   she brooded until her mind was affected . all the houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology . 
frankly my dear i did n't expect anything like this from a nice level - headed girl .   what are you driving at ? 
a missionary 's widow ?   it is n't very likely is it ? 
have n't i ?   i suppose i take it for granted . it 's just part of everyday life here . 
some of this native nonsense . the houngan has his prescription and dr. maxwell and i have ours . 
try it -- you may have more influence than you think . 
use your influence with paul .   ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table . 
so -- he says i 'm nice .   he 's a nice boy too miss connell a very nice boy .   but i 'm worried about his drinking . 
nonsense child !   i know wesley 's been drinking too much lately .   i know a great deal more about what goes on at fort holland than you 'd think .   i know all about you -- that you 're a nice girl competent and kind to jessica .   the fort needs a girl like you .   but now we 've got to get you back there .   i 'll walk you back and stay over night .   it 'll be a nice change for me . 
come come do n't tell me how sorry you are that i should meet you this way .   i 'm even a little glad that wesley 's difficulty brought us together . 
i really intended going out to the fort and meeting you long before this miss connell .   i 'm mrs. rand -- wesley 's mother . 
ti - joseph ? 
i think you need some help . 
it 's you ben who needs to talk . i 've had my say and i 'm waiting to hear back from you . 
so maybe you 'll come too ? 
i did but -- somebody should probably see her talk to her ... you think she 's ok ? 
i 've been thinking ben about wendy . i was going to ask if she 'd come with me sometime to meet dr. woolens . 
you 're staring at me . 
do n't be so modest ben . it 's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends . you were the first to predict that billy jack would be a hit -- 
no thank you . we should be off . 
i suppose we 'll make an appearance . 
thank you janey . 
a key party ? 
sure . maybe coffee . 
yeah . you ? 
maybe you just need -- look can you wait here a sec i need to tidy up -- just a minute i 'll be right back . you 'll wait ? 
well we can talk about it . 
jim maybe we should just go . i 've got to look in on the kids . paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city . 
okay . shall we clean up around here first ? do you think it 's all right-- 
now do n't make me feel as if i 'm being too forward ok ? if you do n't -- 
my husband is probably passed out in the bathroom or at least he wishes he were . i 've been married to him for 17 years and i do n't have any intention of going in there to get him ... so what i 'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy and since you are standing here alone i 'm proposing that you and i do what makes sense . stay warm . pass some time . that 's all . 
well maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen -- 
you could n't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk . 
let me . 
it 'll warm you up . 
just bundle up . it 's supposed to freeze tonight . we 'll see you in the morning . 
what sort of problems are you planning exactly ? 
i suppose . why ? 
we 're going to the halford 's . the number 's on the calendar in the kitchen . we should be home around 11 . 
well i 'm sure your father and i would love to hear what you 're playing these days . maybe after dinner . 
i thought you quit the band - i never hear you practice anymore . 
oh wendy . 
we 've been through this wendy james taylor was actually at that clinic up near boston . 
the people at silver meadows are n't psychos . 
wendy of course . i 'm sorry . you must think i 'm ripe to be checked into silver meadows . 
weightless almost -- as if i were seeing my own memories of being a girl . there was something internal about it . 
mikey williams ? 
i saw you on your bike today . 
hi wendy . 
thanks for the lift . if the bike 's any bother-- 
i 'm that predictable ? no you do n't have to answer that . it 's just that with the kids almost grown -- 
how 'd you know ? 
i 'm thinking of going back to school . 
i used to know how to cook . 
thanks again . for the dinner . 
of course . 
it 's not a bother . 
i 'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile . 
you 're here ... i 'm a bit surprised . 
reverend edwards . 
i 'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about .   take care . 
and you 're still trying to get me into bed . 
but not too ashamed . 
i 'm sorry . that was stupid of me . i did n't mean to be so rude . 
i would say it sounds like you 're trying to get me into bed . 
that 's right . 
all well and good -- but tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in ? 
you 're saying that christ is the child and -- 
forget what ? 
my daughter . i have n't been on a bike for years .   when was the last time you rode a bike ? 
i suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- i 've never been much of a joiner although i still consider myself a somewhat religious person -- 
yes it was -- i ended up -- 
he 's probably been waiting all night at the station . 
well then forget all this stern dad stuff . 
talking to me dad ? 
what do you think we 're doing dad ? 
... while children in africa and asia are napalmed and -- 
good - night dad . 
dad stop it ! 
i do n't like coffee . 
oh i thought i 'd steal the station wagon drive up to a commune . or set the house on fire . you know . 
just curious . if there 's a problem i guess i 'll just call you there to interrupt . 
is it a big party ? a big neighborhood party ? 
i do n't really need to practice . i just play a few notes you know so i thought maybe i 'd stay in . 
they need the money for my band uniform at school . 
well i saw what i saw and if you do n't want to believe me -- 
i know . they 're rich drug addicts and celebrities . when i saw james taylor there and -- 
you 're not a psycho ! 
mom . are you ok ? 
we were just riding around . 
with mikey ? 
hi mom . 
maybe . ca n't really tell yet . 
yeah . yours ? 
i do n't know . 
i do n't know . 
maybe we can just watch some tv . 
you have to follow me ? 
then why 'd you come after me ? 
did you tell sandy ? 
sure .   twinkie ? 
i have plans . 
um ten - o - five . why ? where are you ? 
is this charles ? 
hood residence . 
libbets ? what kind of a name is libbets ? 
with who ? 
can i come ? 
why do n't you use the phone downstairs ? 
yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth . 
dad 's like doing his up with people routine mom has n't been saying much . 
greetings charles . 
nixon doofus ! it 's incredible . he should be shot . 
i have not touched your sh--   stuff . you watching this ? 
i do n't know either . you spin around when you lie down . 
that 's nice . are you drunk ? 
that 's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff like after a sexy dream . 
have you ever had a nocturnal emission ? 
one more shot ? 
you never tasted the stuff ? 
want a drink ? 
do n't worry about them . they 're at that party getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about mcgovern and stuff . 
they left it in the jungle . 
well .   it looks like someone got to his private parts before us . 
he would n't blow up . he 'd just get all mangled or twisted . 
he 's dead . 
just thought i 'd stop by . 
sandy you scared the shit out of me . 
i have to go to the bathroom . 
the ones you built ? 
hey sandy what were you blowing up out there ? your mom was pretty p.o . 'd . 
yeah ? see ya . 
hey sandy . 
did n't want to miss anything . 
yes sir . 
do n't worry .   i 'll have a cool scar . 
i know . 
worth pursuing ? 
is n't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop ?   a good cop ca n't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle 's missing .   a bad cop ca n't sleep 'cause his conscience wo n't let him .   you said that once remember ? 
about an hour ago .   said he was more than happy to cooperate . 
five feet ?   seven feet ? 
how much closer would you say you were ? 
but here 's the thing .   i retraced your exact steps according to your statement . you could n't have seen detective eckhart from there .   i mean not in that fog . 
that must have been awful for you . 
oh i should n't have ... 
twelve years younger . 
the puffins and the hawks .   we 're in extra innings .   the hawks have a really good line - up this year . 
oh .   we always have play - offs in the middle of the night .   it 's the best time . 
yeah .   all over . 
the bartender at darrow 's .   he was there friday night . 
but there was n't any ... 
we already did . 
down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in . 
but they 're so boring .   all small stuff . 
do n't worry about him ... 
detective eckhart !   i know !   welcome to nightmute ! 
brody ... i do n't know ...   ... something brody ! 
she used some stupid code name . 
my arm ! 
she kept saying she was gon na get out of here .   leave us all behind .   that < i > he</i > was going to take her ! 
it was like some big fucking secret ! 
she would n't tell me ! 
i do n't know . 
that 's what i said . 
long as it 's fun . 
we were like sisters .   knew everything about each other . 
since grade school . 
i was her best friend . 
what are you doing in this shit - hole town ? 
i never met anyone from seattle before . 
i 'll put you in your coffin . forever . 
do n't louis -- 
yes . it killed them unfortunately . but it keeps the blood warm . 
no . laudanum . 
drunk on brandy wine . a thimblefull . i thought of you when i saw them . 
oh lestat . i must do more than that . i 've brought a present for you . 
i came to make peace with you even if you 're the father of lies . i want things to be as they were . 
you 're a liar . but you upset my plans . 
i suppose we could people the world with vampires the three of us . 
is that supposed to frighten me ? 
does it ? 
why yours alone ? tell me how it was done ! ! ! ! 
did you do it to me ? ? ? ? 
you made us what we are did n't you ? 
but it was n't always so ! i had a mother once ! and louis - he had a wife ! he was mortal the same as she ! and so was i ! 
and if i cut my hair again ? 
which of you did it ? which of you made me the way i am ? 
you dress me like a doll . you make my hair like a doll . why ? 
i have . or there would be twice as many . 
is this my birthday ? 
you always give me the doll on the same night of the year . 
why always on this night ? 
i 'm not your daughter . 
i want some more . 
what do you mean ? 
but if she dies ... 
and who will care for me my love my dark angel when you are gone ? 
oh god ! i love you still that 's the torment of it . but you know i must leave you louis ... 
yet you could do it to me ! snatching me from my mother 's hands like two monsters in a fairy - tale ! could n't you have waited ? six more years and i would have had that shape ! and now you weep ! you have n't tears enough for what you 've done to me . 
your evil is that you can not be evil ! and i will suffer for it no longer ! 
you really believe that ? 
let him go he said . let him go . 
do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word ? when he put me in that trance ... 
he wants you as you want him . he 's been waiting for you . he wants you for a companion . he bides his time that place . he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do . 
you would leave me for armand if he beckoned you . 
no you would not louis . danger hold you to me . 
i can feel it from them ! they want to know who made us what became of him . they have their rules their idiotic rules ! 
i lothe them ! i ca n't stand the sight of them ! stupid bourgeois parisians all dressed in black like some private club ! i 've searched for them the world over and i despise them ! 
be still ! 
yes and very beautiful . 
and no one knows but us ... 
she 's no vampire . 
how devilishly clever . 
mortals mortals everywhere . and lots of drops to drink . 
but this ca n't be real . this is nonsense . 
yes . should i take her louis ? among her dolls ? make a doll of her in turn ? 
are they my kind louis ? dolls never change either . 
they are ducklings that will grow into swans . whereas i must be the duckling forever . 
or her or her - or any of them ? 
but how will i ever know louis ? 
you do n't remember ? or you never knew . 
well tell me papa . what was it like making love ? 
you want me to be your daughter forever do n't you ? 
a beautiful child ! is that what you still think i am ? 
how do i look ? 
the ship is sailing wihout us ! 
it is ! take the back stairwell - 
what was that ? 
tell me you do n't hate me louis . i did it for you - 
i ca n't bear it when you do - i would die rather than lose you louis . i would die the way he died . 
you never talked to me like that - in all these years . 
louis look at me . 
i did it for us louis . so we could be free . 
he belongs with those reptiles louis . he deserved to die . 
in europe louis . we shall meet our own kind . find the one who made him . learn what it means . 
the swamp ... 
should we burn him ? bury him ? what would he have liked louis ? 
the one good lesson he taught me louis . never drink from the dead . 
do n't mock me louis . help me . 
but now 's the time to end it louis . now 's the time to leave him . 
you both did it ? 
you ... fed on me ? 
and it means something else too does n't it ? i shall never ever grow up . 
tell me why ... you've got to tell me ... 
why not ? 
you want me to be a doll forever ? 
sit still . it 's not finished - 
why does he call you that ? 
infant death he calls me . sweet daughter death . you know what he calls you ? merciful death . 
but you never let me see you kill louis . 
the way i learn everything . by watching you . 
i want more . 
what the hell would you call this ? 
what about a radio ? 
wait ... did you say off - season ?

karla ! did you tell him i 'd be here ? 
tyrell i appreciate it but have you seen my people dance ? we make the mouth face we move the fingers -- 
there 's nothing between will and me .

we 'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun drink fruity drinks and swim and ...   you know ... 
ray karla won a trip to the bahamas ! an island called tower bay . and she wants us to come with her . 
it 's okay . 
no you do n't have to be sorry . i 'm the one -- 
it 's not like that . it 's not you . it 's me . my head . i want to go back . i want to be with you . i want to be fine . i want everything to be like it used to be .   it just is n't . 
i just feel like some part of me has n't healed up enough to go back . like some critical piece is missing . please understand ... 
ray i ca n't ... 
why are you being like this ? 
ray we 're just friend . 
oh that 's will . he 's a friend . you 'd like him . 
wait it 's nancy -- 
i do n't know . 
ben willis . 
we 're all going to die . he 's going to kill us one by one . 
i am not crazy tyrell . he was right there . 
tyrell you are an unstoppable force of nature . 
... why ? 
i trusted you . 
why are you doing this to me ? 
he 's in it with willis ? 
did you get help ? 
i was n't dreaming . 
there was a body ! i swear it ! 
it 's in my room ! 
are you sure ? i really appreciate it . 
no -- it 's not that . it's ... i'm just a little on edge . i 'm really sorry . 
no no no . this was really sweet ... 
oh will ! i 'm sorry . 
he did something to the screen ... it it said ... 
it's ... him . 
sure . it 's fine . as long as you do n't snore . 
it beets being on the mainland . 
you 've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning . 
deep breaths -- 
just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood . 
i 'm okay . 
right . now i remember . 
i 'm trying . i really am ... sometimes i do n't even know why i came up here in the first place . 
it was one year ago ... 
it ca n't get worse . i mean it 's not like this was the first time i freaked out in class . i hardly ever get a full night 's sleep my grades suck i 'm this close from being thrown out of school . 
i thought i was over the dreams for good . i really did . i had n't had one for months . 
it was in a church ... it was so real . i mean i could feel his breath on me . 
i 'm fine . 
i 'm fine . 
she 's in her room . 
how disappointing ! i expected it was something more romantic . a temple to the goddess of love perhaps . 
how clover you are mr. albrecht to see all that in our simple thea ... she is quite pretty is n't she ? 
i do n't know now without my father . 
if only we could get away - - you and i. the others are strangers they mean nothing to me 
last night dr. drossos -- today you or i -- oh no oliver it ca n't be you i could n't stand it . 
my father -- i 'm alone oliver completely alone ! 
closer and closer - until they bite into your throat ! 
tell me about them thea . they have great wings end long teeth -- 
oh no - it 's too delicious ! you 're making it up ! 
i think she went to bed  i saw her going toward the house 
no one can take my father 's place . 
you 're not leaving tomorrow .. ? 
good night oliver . 
thank you . 
i 'm glad you and the general did n't have to leave us . we would feel quite deserted .. 
i adore hearing thea sing -- but my poor head 's beginning to ache .   i 'm so sorry . 
m~ father will take care of it .   pappa is wonderful ! no matter what happens he makes me feel perfectly safe .   i could never leave him . i should be utterly helpless by myself . 
that was my companion . she sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice of course . 
shh it 's all right - i 'll be all right . 
it 's getting dark . i ca n't leave now . 
no that 's thea 's bed . miss wollsten 's bed is in there . 
how kind you are . it is so comforting to know that someone cares . 
what are you doing ? 
she has never mentioned her family . 
some village in the mountains -- alethera i think . 
i 'm so ill i 'm so exhausted -- i almost do n't care . 
we quarreled . she never dared get angry or frightened -- but i said things to her -- it was an attack i know it was . 
suppose she is n't dead . suppose it was a cataleptic attack ? 
when i close my eyes i see miss wollsten . i ca n't think of anything else . 
that should decide it or you -- 
come thea if you 're going to claim him as your father you 've got to make up your mind . they 'll be leaving any minute . 
the general  you do n't even know him . 
thea your choice is a very simple one . either you want to claim him as your father or you do not . 
i have forgotten it dear . 
what is it -- what are you talking about ? 
thea -- you 're hiding something . why do you suddenly speak of your father ? you told me once you had never seen him -- did n't know him -- 
why i love my father because - because i do . of course he 's nice to me . 
what an odd question ! 
thea is an orphan . 
the young man mr. davis seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer  a correspondent of some sort  
would n't i ? 
when i tell him that you 're unfit to live a normal life with normal people - a cataleptic ! 
really this is idiotic ! 
would you care to explain what you 're talking about ? 
no . i mean your other secret - the one you kept bidden even from my father . that old doctor in london -- he told me . 
you will not say one single word . i know your secret . 
why i 'm fond of thea . 
what if he is ? 
what would i be thinking ? 
you were father 's secretary - i never thought - - 
how do you know what my father thought - - 
miss wollsten ! 
whet do you mean ? 
it was the plague 
she is dead  at peace . 
you should sleep cathy . lie down and close your eyes . try to forget everything . 
i will let him go . he is dead to me as he is to all my mother 's people . i turn my hand against him . 
i felt he did not like me . 
i do n't know . as a child . i longed for a father and now - i do n't know  
but one must love a father . 
my last name is pherides . 
you have forgotten my last name ? 
i do not know him but i have seen him . 
i mean does one love a father because he is good and kind -or just because he is one 's father ? 
cathy - how does it feel to have a father ? 
you are fortunate in your father . 
and the soldier -- he looked at me so strangely -- who is he ? 
no -- you musn't . he thinks i 've bewitched you . he wo n't believe it - he 'll hate me even more ! my only chance is to stay away from him . 
for a moment when he looked at me so sadly i felt that i had wronged him . but then -- 
then why does he persecute me ? my family told me what kind of man he is how he stole my mother and then abandoned her -- 
it is for that he hates me . 
it is more than a feud between two families . he stole my mother away from her people . 
he hates all my race . 
i ca n't . 
he keeps asking for the name of my father and mother . 
the general threatened me . 
please .. you should n't laugh -- 
sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way i 'm afraid of him . 
i do n't know . everything 's so mixed up -- 
yes but george . . . 
yes but what happened to george ? 
i know . i know . he did n't go . 
did he ever marry the girl ? did he ever go exploring ? 
it 's a good face . i like it . i like george bailey . tell me did he ever tell anyone about the pills ? 
oh you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist . 
who is it ? 
what did you stop it for ? 
a boy ? 
hey who 's that ? 
oh wonderful ! 
why yes . this is amazing . 
where ? i do n't see a thing . 
well naturally . of course . 
sit down ? what are . . . 
oh thank you sir . thank you . 
the adventures of tom sawyer . 
sir . . . if i should accomplish this mission  i mean  might i perhaps win my wings ? i 've been waiting for over two hundred years now sir  and people are beginning to talk . 
oh dear dear ! his life ! then i 've only got an hour to dress . what are they wearing now ? 
splendid ! is he sick ? 
you sent for me sir ? 
you have no idea what happened . . . 
oh george george ! 
oh george george george . 
george darling ! where have you been ? 
where 're you going ? 
just a teensie one  ninety - nine six . she 'll be all right . 
yes i called him right away . he says it 's nothing to worry about . 
just a cold . the doctor says it 's nothing serious . 
oh she 's got a cold . she 's in bed . caught it coming home from school . they gave her a flower for a prize and she did n't want to crush it so she did n't button up her coat . 
where 's your coat and hat ? 
is it snowing ? 
george bailey lassos stork . 
my baby . 
i did n't want to marry anybody else in town . i want my baby to look like you . 
to keep from being an old maid . 
have fun . 
remember the night we broke the windows in this old house ? this is what i wished for . 
please let 's not stop george . 
after that who cares ? 
i feel like a bootlegger 's wife .   look ! 
george . . . george . . . george . . . 
oh it 's just marriage in general you 're not enthusiastic about huh ? 
do n't you like her ? 
thank you . 
well then sit down . 
would you rather leave ? 
oh i worked there for a couple of vacations but i do n't know . . . i guess i was homesick . 
do you like it ? 
well are you coming in or are n't you ? 
did n't you tell her ? 
about coming in . your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit . 
have you made up your mind ? 
yeah so i noticed . have you made up your mind ? 
i 'm going to scream ! 
i 'll take it . and then what ? 
if i told you it might not come true . 
oh no . 
what 'd you wish george ? 
uh - huh . 
oh no george do n't . it 's full of romance that old place . i 'd like to live in it . 
oh no do n't . i love that old house . 
you may kiss my hand . 
too young or too old ? 
well why do n't you say it ? 
do i look as funny as you do ? 
neither am i. 
uh - huh . 
you 've passed me on the street almost every day . 
hello . you look at me as if you did n't know me . 
a new magazine ! i never saw it before . 
i do n't like coconuts . 
i 'll take chocolate . 
do n't be ridiculous -- sharks do n't take things personally . 
not when it 's like this .   this animal has been ashore for 10 12 hours and drifting for a day at least .   every little nibbler in the sea 's taken a bite . 
it 's either a great white or another killer whale . 
not necessarily .   these wounds could 've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea or more .   none of them are immediately fatal .   currents could 've carried the body 10 miles further . 
sound .   like sonar or radar . they home in on irregular sounds unusual sounds any rhythmic low- frequency vibration . 
and sound . 
this is a mammal not a fish . 
what makes you think there might be ? 
okay so that 's it . 
carcharadon carcharias . 
do you ? 
could be a shark .   but maybe not . 
you do n't tell me my job and i wo n't tell you about yours okay ? 
we do n't know that do we ? 
what shark ? 
the whale 's mouth ? 
the what ? 
length 22 feet 8 inches . 
first things first . 
after we 've looked we 'll talk . 
what is it ?   what 's the matter ? 
what 're you doing ? 
hey -- it 's not your job any more . i 'm going to be late for work . 
i 'll give notice . 
what 're you going to do today ? 
i know you did .... 
they have no right to treat you like that .   you 've given them every- thing .   for four years you 've protected this town the people on this island .... 
honey this is nothing ... i do n't know what it is .   what did they .... 
stop that !   we 're not going any place .   you love it here .   tell me what the hell happened ! 
because of today ?   the beach ? 
that you were fired . 
what 's wrong ? 
sean 's asleep . 
hi .   i closed a sale today without len .   that 's $ 1200 commission if the papers go through . 
are you going to be able to sleep ? 
it was bad was n't it . 
do you ? 
all summer ? 
oh .   want to talk about it ? 
use the little brush there .   why were you at santos ' ? 
nothing huh ? 
careful .   what 's wrong ? 
oh perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair .   where were you ? 
sort of -- mathew hooper is aboard the research vessel aurora presently in the antarctic ocean and wo n't be in radio range until half - past next spring . 
thank you .   i 'll tell him . 
it 's an island .   got to run . 
one what ?   ah - ha ! 
why do n't you take a half day and clean this junk up ? 
where 's my day book ? 
eat cheerios . 
so 's a donut . 
you have to smoke so early in the morning ? 
hey !   that 's my boss ! 
as far as the office . 
mrs. silvera . 
door 's locked . 
let 's get the kid home . 
fooling around ? 
and how .   i thought you would n't respect me . 
my boss and your boss .   sure . 
i can see that . do n't you know this is a big deal ? 
where the hell were you ? 
be careful .... 
hurry please . 
i 'm going . 
mike ?   our mike ? 
what kids ?   who went out ? 
okay ... have them get it out of the tank . 
get the hose !   we 've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him ! 
go on you 're tired . 
why do n't you take a rest brian ? 
i have to walk him till the drug wears off . 
no it will be too much distraction .   i do n't want that many people in the water .   i 'll go in give it a belly shot and get out . 
with those camera lights and ... 
i can get it . 
no one 's ever caught a great white except indirectly in fishing nets . i want to dart it and keep it alive . 
are you okay ? 
you do n't have to prove anything . 
michael you do n't have to go down there . 
but you -- 
michael you 're not going down there . 
who 's going to do it ? 
... i have to go honey .   phillip and i are going down together to kill the shark . 
how is he ? 
you two go !   i 'll call calvin ! 
somebody better get down there ! 
that 's why they 're always moving . they have to have it . 
that 's what i 've come to ask you . is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing ? 
this tooth is from another shark . a shark that could be 30 feet long ! 
that 's just it michael .   we do n't ! 
it was removed from charlie overman 's body . 
it 's a shark 's tooth ! 
yes you can . 
come on . 
michael take deep breaths . 
honey what is it ? 
i did .   he wants it on exhibit . 
it 's too soon to move him . 
calvin wants me to move the white for tomorrow . 
michael i do n't have time . please !   it 's time you dealt with this and got over it .   now come on ! 
they 're not going to hurt you . they 're encased in plastic . 
michael come on do n't be silly . this is the quickest way .   you 're not going to walk all the way around ? 
yes .   it 's faster . 
no we 'll go through here . 
i want to make sure the white is getting enough flow .   would you do that for me ? 
i need more pressure in the shark tank . 
they said you 'd be here . 
it 's my new perfume .   great white the man - eater . 
mmmm ... you smell good . 
recovering nicely . 
get some sleep .   and tell sean i 'm sorry . 
sounds wonderful . 
... me too . 
no you 're not . 
it 's easier to lure sharks at night . 
thank you . 
fine piece of engineering . 
what 's that ? 
i got it on sale .   a real steel . 
i know i can capture it . 
do n't think about it .   it 's over . 
how the hell did it get in here ? 
i 'm okay . 
you all right ? 
get your reserve bottle and let 's go . 
are you coming ... ? 
i talked you into this ? 
make up your mind . 
okay stay .   we 'll come back for you . 
michael the sub 's dead . 
that we swim . 
... electrical connection malfunctioning . 
you know on our honeymoon we should go scuba diving . 
it 's romantic down here . 
that 's a lot of ground to cover . 
they just wanted to say hello . 
hi baby . 
are you scared ? 
honey ... you all right ? 
just put your mask on . 
take a deep breath and hold it . 
look michael ... you do n't have to come . 
we play hide and seek all the time .   they find a lot of things . 
get out of here ! 
no you do n't need all that starch .   you 're getting too fat . 
i ca n't leave now .   we taking sean out ? 
he does n't need the money .   he inherited a fortune .   he kills for kicks .   tv battles between non - predator fish and divers . the diver always wins . 
i do n't like what he does . 
... hutton .   he really pisses me off . 
i do n't know .   i ca n't understand it .   something 's bothering them . 
everything 's going wrong .   i 'm having more trouble with bobby than i ever have before .   i ca n't get him to respond . 
okay bye . 
my imagination is n't that good . 
that macho pompous english -- 
see you later . 
do n't forget you have your brother . 
i guess . 
they 're acting very strange suddenly . 
you will .   i 'll see to it . 
till this opens not our wedding . 
well not much longer to go . 
thank you . 
the net would have to be secured by the intake passage . 
she mister hutton . 
the water ski show !   we have to get them out ! 
how 'd it get in here ? ! 
sharks have to keep moving .   they can never stop or they 'll suffocate . if water is n't always flowing through them they 'll die . 
thanks to you . 
brian he 's coming around ! 
get ready to go . 
i think that you and i are natural enemies . 
we 're all from the sea mr. hutton . our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans .   by continuing to destroy fish man destroys himself . 
before you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade .   now you 're helping to nurse it back to life . 
you 're a strange man mr. hutton . 
somebody could have gotten hurt . 
skillful ?   i missed my first shot . 
so do i.   but for different reasons . 
why are you ? 
thanks for helping . 
should be coming out of it soon . 
still sleeping . 
you 're supposed to film it not turn it to hash ! 
i insist you get rid of that bomb . 
because i do n't trust you that 's why . 
i know it and i will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that ! 
we 're taking that shark alive ! 
what in hell is that ? 
you look like an orange worm . 
i want that shark alive . 
like hell ! 
i will . 
the only great white in captivity calvin .   all those people standing in line ... 
it 's one of the world 's greatest creatures . 
calvin i insist i be allowed to capture it ! 
i 've handled sharks before . bigger than this one . 
i think we can capture it .   i 'd like to try . 
sharks are man - biters mister hutton .   not man - eaters -- 
i 'm sorry . 
i told you something 's upset them . 
i can have them walk backwards . 
wait a minute .   these are n't kangaroos mr. hutton .   they 're dolphins . 
it 's no use .   they wo n't come into the lagoon . 
make this quick ! 
i do n't know .   they 're nervous and skittish right now . 
they 're not tricks .   they 're behavior patterns . 
nobody told me . 
go where ? 
not good enough . 
i should have never listened to calvin . 
i knew it ;   it 's my fault .   we moved it too soon . 
when did this happen ? 
and big for his age . 
i know . 
i think they 'll come out now . 
i 'm neo - senephrened out .   think i 'm catching a cold . 
hi mike .

i do n't know how ....

i 'm going back to the institute . 
why ca n't i stay with you ? 
alright i 'm worried about christmas . i wish i had n't told him i 'd be back .. 
no i 'm not . 
i do n't think so .. he said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions .. 
coz you hardly said a word since you got here . but you been thinking pretty loud .. 
i know . 
fifty - seven .. i do n't mind .. 
just your age . 
he said you 're quite chubby . and you have a nervous tick . 
ross told me . 
i know what you 're like .. 
have you known her long ? 
you said you were in the bad lands ? 
do you pray ? 
no wordsworth .. do you like poetry ? 
you just asked me to ask you questions . 
are you married ? 
i 'm sorry .. i do n't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. i feel like everyone 's looking at me .. 
are you wearing a uniform ? 
you should . it 's wonderful . 
hamlet . have you read it ? 
it was probably the wind . 
if i came to the diner with you would you bring me back ? 
i suppose i 'm the worst witness you 've ever had ? 
i 'm sorry . i 'll get my things . 
have you been here long ? 
i do n't know .

i do n't know . i guess she must have called him john ? i 'm mak- ing tea . would you like some ? 
why not ? you heard my voice ? 
when we spoke on the phone did you know i was blonde ? 
well i think i told you on the phone .. i went up to her room to say good - bye and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things .. 
what d'you wanna ask mr ross ? 
is that margie ? 
do n't mix very well with beer . 
you think john would like it ? 
i have n't worn heels since i was 16 . i do n't think i could walk in these ? 
you think he still loves her ? 
what does that mean ? 
what was she like ? 
when did john divorce ? 
oh jerry . 
i did the 23 hour nose - route to the top of el capitan in 6 hours ! i can make this work . 
no one has ever dumped me . 
you 've never been alone and you ca n't be alone -- 
did n't hear it . 
do n't say it .   we 're both ragged out right now . 
what was our deal when we first got together ?   brutal truth remember ? 
jerry .   you and i are salespeople . we sell -- 
i have to finish my job -- 
it 's all about you is n't it ? soothe me save me love me -- 
oh honey .   it 's spun . 
i just heard .

you lost your head it happens .   i 'm so fuckin jazzed !   listen . i 'm going to have to fly to chicago tomorrow how 'bout if we meet in the dallas airport and we all fly into new york together for the draft ? 
do n't worry about it -- i never told you what i thought of that memo either -- 
let 's go .   i 'll drive you . _ 45 . 
i 'm sorry .   i was on a roll .   i meant something else .   when do you want to leave ? 
you are not a loser . 
king of the housecalls ! master of the living room ! 
well it worked and i will not let you fail .   you are jerry ma- fuckin - guire . 
good .   they 're all heatseekers !   all of them everybody . you keep one superstar and they 'll all follow . there 's no real loyalty and the first person who told me that jerry maguire was you . 
and the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket .   tell me again how was it left with cush ? 
who told you ? 
oh -- do n't forget tomorrow we have dinner with wade cooksey . 
jerry this is what intimacy is ! 
oh gawd oh yes it 's never been better . never better ! ! 
do n't ever stop fucking me ! 
still going . 
he 's asleep right ? 
good that 'll put him to sleep early . no offense . 
do n't let him stay up too late . 
aw shut up .   you had me at hello . _ 130 . 
come on jerry .   you know this is n't easy for me .   _ 118 . 
there 's no question you 'll be friends . of course you 'll be friends . 
i know .   i watched it .   i sort of know it by heart . 
i think we made a mistake here . 
why fucking not !   i deserve it . 
i do n't know -- 
i took advantage of you and worst of all i 'm not alone . i did this with a kid .   i was just on some ride where i thought i was in 1ove enough for both of us .   i did this .   and at least i can do something about it now . 
it 's not fair to you .   this whole -- 
it 's my fault . 
why do you love me ? 
okay ... i will ... 
and i really do n't know your noises yet . 
sometimes i ca n't tell at all what 's going through that head of yours . 
no no .   do n't do that .   do n't say that if you do n't ... 
look just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes ... whatever ...   do n't make a joke of your life . go back and read what you wrote . you 're better than the rest of them better than the bob sugars and do n't forget it . 
this rig ? phht .   no problem . 
fine i just -- 
oh god . 
okay . wait here a second .   do we really want to do this ? 
no .   i have to go in .   i live here . 
i think you should not come in or come in depending on how you feel . 
good night . 
let 's not tell our sad stories . 
yeah .   it was n't like my marriage to roger was so great even before --   jerry ? 
maybe you should call her . 
maybe love should n't be such hard work . i know but -- 
we 'll see you soon honey . bye . 
yeah -- guess i got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster .   you meet chad the nanny ? 
exactly because i know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts .   _ 86 . 
oh good . 
i 'm relieved you said that . 
yeah what happened there . 
you do n't have to explain . 
plus you could use that commission . 
dennis wilburn called from arizona to say he 's faxing in the new tidwell offer on thursday morning and you 'll be happy . 
good evening . 
i may not sue . 
no .   no do n't feel like clarence thomas . 
yeah i did . 
do n't worry about it boss . 
i 'm working with you because of that memo ... 
what you wrote inspired me . _ 79 . 
-- especially one like this . 
do n't worry about me .   i can get jobs -- 
drinks .   food .   plus i called you a cab . 
beer okay ? 
sorry .   uh let me see have a seat . i 'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too . 
jesus it 's a real gash is n't it ? 
too bad . 
oh my god . 
he 's asleep .   watch out for that lamp . 
hey you . 
okay have we gone over everything ? back on tuesday right ? 
call me later hon . 
happy for us ... okay .   here 's the number . 404 - 453 - 2222 . 
well i 'm happy for you . 
i just got goosebumps . 
we are ? 
... light . 
wait .   that 's yesterday from the other office . today is ... 
sorry that 's my son and the nanny . i had the calls transferred to my home so i could go over your stuff . 
honey -- later okay ?   whoop .   wait . 
that took guts . 
no no i know -- 
and i guess we did n't talk about money .   so i 'll just dive in -- 
so i know this is a bad time but -- you will have a medical program right ? 
oh no .   i 'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to manhattan beach taking that left down to little tiny waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic and your life flashes before your eyes but -- hey i 've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here 's my sister laurel to pick us up .   thanks though . bye . 
oh tsht . yes . 
i think in this age optimism like that ... it 's a revolutionary act . 
nnnnn .   i just killed the surprise . 
oh no . 
and have fun at your bachelor party . 
well thanks . 
my son ... my mind ... 
hmm .   pretty good . 
oh .   hi .   i work in your office . i was on the junket to the conference . i 'm -- 
oh tell the story . 
oh well why did n't you say so ? and oh i do n't know if you 're interested in this detail but i was just about to tell you that i love him .   i love him and i do n't care what you think .   i love him for the guy he wants to be and i love him for the guy he almost is . i love him . 
please if i start talking -- 
oh knock it off ! _ 89 . 
that 's the first time i ever saw him kiss a man like a dad was n't that just ... thrilling ?   i mean he must have been needing that . 
i 've got a 24 hour a day reminder of roger for the rest of my life . i have had three lovers in four years all boring all achingly self - sufficient all friends of yours i might add and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath .   look at me laurel look at me .   i 'm the oldest 26 year old in the world !   how do i look ? 
as opposed to twenty angry women ? 
that 's the girl i love . 
thank you . 
no kidding .   i looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen . 
honey he 's engaged .   and for the first time in my professional life i 'm a part of something i believe in . 
he just lost his best client .   he called from the plane .   i invited the guy over . 
he 's coming over . 
wait . where is he ? 
of course i know -- 
if you 'd read what he wrote you would have left with him too . 
of course medical ! _ 42 . 
easy hon i was just looking for fun details -- 
guys are just different people when they 're hanging onto the bottom rung . 
because i 'm worried that you 're putting your faith in this guy who because of the way things are going may not have an emotional marble in his head . 
first you got ta tell me something . 
no no .   do n't cry at the beginning of the date . 
forgot your keys -- 
but you just got ta hear me out on one thing .   you 're very responsible with ray and you know it 's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man 's voice in the house . 
look here 's some of that chicken with salsa too i warmed it up -- _ 74 . 
this guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest .   wait .   use the frosted glasses . 
i heard . 
at eleven at night ? _ 70 . 
he 's in the living room asleep . 
you know how much those well child exams cost -- 
you are a single mother .   you have given up the right to be frivolous . 
what about medical ? 
what is it ? 
do you think it goes all the way across ? 
this is how you make dinosaurs ? 
he 's smart dr. grant . and he knows so much about dinosaurs . 
still you have survived the dinosaurs before . you saved those kids . 
errr - iiic ! 
i would completely support that . 
i do . it 's worth another shot . and who knows ? things might turn out differently . 
we should try fishing again . 
but he did n't . and neither did you . and i 'm glad about that . 
how would you have helped eric ?   he needs you paul . he needs us . 
you could n't have made that jump . 
paul ! where is he ? can you see him ? 
eric its okay . you 'll be right behind me . 
sweetheart you 're okay .   you 're okay .   you 're okay . 
what? ... what ! ? 
when did you have it last ? 
he would have been safe . completely entirely suffocatingly safe .   i would have him to see more of the world than enid oklahoma . i wanted to see more of the world than enid oklahoma . and so yes it 's my fault that this happened . i 'm sorry that you have to be here . 
this would n't happen if he was with you . i mean you drive five miles below the speed limit . i totaled three cars in fives years . 
well what ? 
we ca n't just stop looking . eric and dr. grant are out there somewhere . 
we have to help him . 
he 's this way . 
its not about him . it 's eric . he 's alone out here somewhere . our baby is all alone . 
no it 's ... 
i filmed this the morning they left . 
just drop it paul ! 
oh do n't worry about that . 
dr. grant says this dr. grant says that ... 
well we should split up or something . we can cover twice the area . 
so do you . 
you hate to swim . 
how much weight have you lost ? 
nothing you have n't seen before . 
a friend . we were vacationing . eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs so ben found a guy who would take them parasailing . they never came back . 
we ca n't just ... 
what 's a bad idea ? 
from what i understand it 's pretty much whatever we want . 
... once - in - a - lifetime . 
we even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight . 
it is truly whats the word ? inspiring . 
you had the phone the whole time ? 
what about eric ? 
what about eric and dr. grant ? 
he 's not a kill he 's still alive . 
i thought we were n't suppose to yell . 
he 's with a man named ben hildebrand . 
you see that 's just the thing . paul and i have special permission to fly low . 
okay . he loves us very very much . and i know that right now more than anything your dad would want to know that we 're safe . okay ? 
let me tell you a few things about you dad okay ? he 's very very very clever very very brave and he loves you ever very much . 
i know . i know . i want to look for him too . 
just hold on . 
we 've got to see one to find out . is there any -- 
why would n't they ?   look at hyenas jackals nearly all species of predator birds -- 
and let 's forget about the high hide . we ca n't do this kind of work up in a tower we need to be out in the field as close to the animals as possible . 
ian you 're not insane !   i 'm so glad ! 
not without a shot of the nest . 
that was a pair bond !   a family group even long after that infant was nestbound ! 
you 're going too ? 
oh god . 
do n't start a legal argument with me this island is n't your property and neither are these animals ! 
these formations .   they 're dried -- 
ian .   it 's guano . 
ian they will misplace our evidence shoot holes in our testimony and say some special effects genius created the animals .   the only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a t - rex in the middle of times square . 
you know even if we do get those tapes back people are going to say it 's just another hoax .   ian malcolm 's alien autopsy . 
what ? ! 
they will come after me .   but i can collect some stool samples for dna with that nick 's tapes and the rest of you to back me up it should stand when we get back . 
i swear to god it works with lions sometimes !   there we are -- your baby is free -- 
born free as free as the wind blows . as free as the grass grows -- 
that 's impossible they ca n't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here ! 
it has to be temporary something that 'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows ... 
funded by whom ? 
lighten up ian you sound like a high school vice - principal . 
what do you want to do ian lock her up for curiosity ?   where do you think she gets it ? 
no more smoking .   we leave no scent of any kind .   no hair tonics no cologne seal all our food in plastic bags .   we will observe and document but we will not interact . 
where 's ian ? 
what are you- 
hold it down nick ! 
we 'll kill it with too much we 'll put it into respiratory arrest !   i 'm almost done .   damn it i need another adhesive something pliable i can -- 
that little black line means death for this infant .   the fibula wo n't heal straight so the ankle joint ca n't pivot when he stands on his hind feet .   the baby wo n't be able to run and probably ca n't even walk . it 'll be crippled and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old . 
ian nothing we observe will be valid if we 're trailing along in the wake of an army . 
ian if we recall the boat now we 've made two invasive landings in one day .   that 'll have to go in any paper i write and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated .   you know the academic world as well as i do once they smell blood in the water you 're dead .   our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic .   that means if we bend a blade of grass we bend it right back the way it- 
-- way we could safely -- 
i believe in him . 
ian 's a very good friend of mine . 
you think this is all a joke ? 
very noble of you .   you do n't think you 're bringing that thing onto the island do you ? 
that must be interesting .   what drew you there ? 
so what 's your story nick ? 
you 've got to be kidding . 
ask her . 
we have to send someone to look for him ! 
move where ?   our boat 's not coming for two days your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send -- 
hey we came here to observe you came here to strip - mine the place ! it 's a looter mentality all you care about is what you can take . 
i 'm fine i 'm fine i was scared i thought you are you okay ? ! 
what are you guys gon na do ? 
on the side of that one truck . 
because you said so .   maybe nobody else believed you but i always did . 
you like to have kids you just do n't want to be with them do you ? 
i do n't care about the trials i want to be with you .   i could be your research assistant like i was in austin . 
i could come with you . 
no .   richard talked to his parents . 
that was about a year ago . 
which one ? 
no dad .   i have thoughts of my own once in a while . 
i 'm your daughter all the time you know .   not just when it 's convenient . 
my vacation is over in a week . 
stop saying fantastic .   where are you going ? 
i do n't even know this woman . 
hi dad . 
how long will this take ? 
how would we cut off the lysine ? 
but would we get the phones back ? 
wait a minute .   what exactly does this mean ? 
two million - - great .   that would help .   oh good that 'll take no time . 
how many lines of code are there ? 
what one ? 
are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours ? i mean what 's hanging us up ? 
oh you know if it 's alright i 'd like to stay with dr. harding and finish with the trike .   is that okay ? 
yours was fully illustrated honey . 
alan ?   where are we going ?   you see something ? 
the question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem and therefore how could you assume you can control it ?   you have plants right here in this building for example that are poisonous .   you picked them because they look pretty but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they 're living in and will defend themselves .   violently if necessary . 
paleo - dna ?   from what source ?   where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood ? ! 
i 'll catch up with you .   you can go with the others . 
there 's only one way to be positive .   i need to see some droppings .   i have to see the dinosaur 's droppings . 
are you sure ? 
that 's pharmacological .   from local plant life . 
these are dilated .   take a look . 
six weeks ? 
okay i 'm following the tubing .   i 'm going down a passage way .   how long does this stuff go for ?   could you guys talk a little bit to me ? 
mr. arnold ?   he 's not answering me .   okay i 'm on the grating . 
control ? !   you never had control !   i was overwhelmed by the power of this place .   so i made a mistake too .   i did n't have enough respect for that power and it 's out now .   you 're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces . john there 's nothing worth picking up .   the only thing that matters now are the people we love .   alan lex and tim .   and john they 're out there where people are dying - - people are dying you know ? 
john john .   john you 're still building onto that flea circus that illusion .   and now you 're adding onto it by what you 're doing here .   that 's the illusion . 
but you ca n't think through this one .   you have to feel it . 
malcolm 's okay for now .   i gave him a shot of morphine . 
alan these are n't bones anymore . 
oh my god . 
oh my god . 
i have samples all over the kitchen . 
did i say jerk ? 
i ca n't get it !   i ca n't get it unless i move ! 
you ca n't hold it by yourself ! 
yes unless they figured out how to open doors . 
i 'll just finish .   yeah i want to finish . 
and when she swallows the stones she swallows the poison berries too .   that 's what makes her sick .   good work tim . 
- - barfs them up - - 
- - which is called a gizzard and it helps them mash their food but what happens after a while - - 
- - like birds .   what happen is they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - - 
- - the undigested state of the berries because it 's - - 
yeah i know . 
constantly sick . 
i know . 
it 's my favorite . 
oh shit . 
ca n't we see the unfertilized host eggs ? ! 
so what are you thinking ? 
we were right ! 
you 've got a t - rex ! ?   he 's got a t - rex !   a t - rex !   he said he's- - 
they were wrong .   case closed .   this thing does n't live in a swamp to support it 's body weight for god 's sake ! 
the - - agility .   you 're right ! 
why would they care what we think ? 
small versions of adults honey . 
okay who 's the jerk ? 
it frustrates me so much that i love you that i need to strangle you right now ! 
anything else you old fossil ? 
the what ? 
alright the one on the airplane had an accident but usually babies do n't smell . 
oh my god they do not !   they do n't smell . 
cheap cheap cheap . 
well not one of those well yeah a possibly one at some point could be a good thing .   what 's so wrong with kids ? 
you know if you really wanted to scare the kid you could 've just pulled a gun on him . 
postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments .   velociraptor ? 
a drought .   the lake was shrinking - - 
if they died together they lived together . suggests some kind of social order . 
they died together ? 
like hell it is ! 
why not ? 
i can see the shed from here !   we can make it if we run ! 
oh my god .   aw god . 
okay i 'm on channel two . 
we 'll discuss sexism in survival situations when i get back .   you just take me through this step by step .   i 'm on channel two . 
i ca n't wait anymore .   something went wrong .   i 'm going to go get the power back on . 
what 's that ? 
alan ? ! 
do you see anything ? 
the other car ! 
no no no ! 
the fences are electrified right ? 
- - shut up . 
seven days ? !   seven days ? !   oh great .   oh good - - clever . 
faster !   shit shit shit faster ! 
faster faster ! 
can we chance moving him ? 
oh imperfections ? 
alan listen to this . 
uh - - thumb !   the same way . 
i 'm still not clear on chaos . 
dinosaur eats man .   woman inherits the earth . 
anti - nature . 
when people try to control things that it 's out of their power - - 
and scary . 
i get ah - - 
phone security systems everything works .   you ask for it we got it ! 
timmy listen to dr. grant ! 
you 're gon na get electrocuted   electrified ! 
timmy !   do as he says !   timmy !   do as dr. grant says quick ! 
do as he says !   the power 's coming back timmy ! 
timmy !   the power is coming down quick ! 
let 's go !

dr. grant !   dr. grant !

i 'm sorry - - i 'm sorry - - 
what 's going to happen to the goat ?   he 's going to eat the goat ? ! 
we love the presents . 
we miss you . 
you 're detestable . 
you 're just doing your job . 
not today burgel .   send one of your memos write up one of your communiques but for god 's sake do n't bother me today . 
say what you like -- no one pays the least attention . 
i do .   always .   you understand the world better than any of us kafka .   and what it 's becoming .   i 've always held you in the highest regard . 
i know better than you what people will say when they have to .   when they brought me in for questioning i informed on my friends the very first day . 
i think you 've just escaped for the moment .   just as i did .   as eduard did .   as they let us do . but only for the moment . 
why should i believe a man who never believed me ?   they 're absolutely right you know -- guilt should never be doubted . it 's easier that way . 
i know there is .   and you 're what i have to bargain with . for now you 're the last one in their way . 
i know how they reward failure . if they saw this i 'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others . 
this is the result of their elixir of youth .   they were to come and check on it during the night .   i contrived to miss the appointment . 
only two steps back ?   even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that . 
should i tell you why i joined our late lamented nihilists ? why i became a murderer ? because murder ... is bliss .   it 's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate evil -- once you 've adopted its procedure . 
over ?   it 's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit . 
i knew you walked this way to work .   i wanted to find you before they did . 
what seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you 're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that . 
or what if there really < u > was</u > an error ? -- i do n't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if burgel was responsible for it ?   one mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion . 
and burgel is the bringer of messages is n't he ? 
how often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records ? 
of course he is -- the castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark .   people disappear up there regularly .    if you want to lie in wait for someone that 's the place to do it . 
he used to like me -- very much more than i liked him . 
burgel hated eduard .   and me .   i 'm sure he knew about us -- and i 'm sure it drove him mad . 
it 's still easier for you to understand suicide is n't it . 
you might think -- i thought so myself at first -- that burgel 's too insignificant to be dangerous . but that 's the very reason to beware ! it 's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character . 
i would n't put it past him . 
of course it could -- burgel 's been trying to get me thrown out as long as i can remember .   < u > he</u > could 've killed eduard . 
they 're not obliged to tell . 
burgel ! -- i did n't leave it with him . 
i 'm collecting eduard 's things . if there 's anything you want take it or i 'll give it to charity . 
you think what we 're doing is so wrong ?   and what are you doing ? pursuing goodness ?   for what ?   to answer to some supreme tribunal ? 
when you only see someone sitting at a desk all day it 's liable to create a false impression . 
you 're shocked at the thought of eduard tossing a bomb through a window . 
he was murdered . 
he was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the medical records division . apparently one of his claims was relevant . 
the day he died eduard was called up to the castle .   did you know that ? 
you strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men .   and yet you 're able to remain an outsider .   with the concomitant air of ... superiority ? 
i nominated you as a possible candidate .   you were eduard 's good friend .   he read me some of your work . 
they 're ubiquitous .   what we try to do ... is make them a little less so . 
you wo n't have any trouble finding it . 
i 'm suspicious of men who want to marry .   i believe they think it 's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers . 
eduard wanted to marry me . 
you almost married recently did n't you ? 
there are some people i 'd like you to meet .   can you come to the musil district at eight o'clock ? 
are you free tonight ? 
the very fact that they 're authorities should give you reason . people will do anything to protect their own interests .   for all you know he was killed at the < u > hands</u > of the police . 
and you believe everything the authorities tell you . 
do you think people in the new town care what happens over here ?   this will always be the ghetto . 
eduard did n't see it as something that needed bearing . 
two or three months that 's all .   -- i seduced him . 
as long as it 's on their terms . if your work and your private life do n't correspond to their specifications you 're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever . 
what 's funny ? 
it 's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office . 
he would have .   you were his best friend .   a better friend than me . 
i was having an affair with eduard .   he did n't tell you ? 
have you looked ? 
hello again . 
excuse me i have to copy this for central docketing by 2:30 . 
one of you must be mistaken . 
why would you suppose so ? 
i know . 
get the hell out of here . '' ! 
take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig ! 
to be quite honest mr denham ... i find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible . 
it 's ... lovely . 
can i see the map ? my father spoke of references to a beast god ... 
there 's no hard feelings mr denham ! i just want to come to the island with you ! 
i 'm coming onboard ! throw down a ladder ! 
look mr denham - you 're not welcome here . just pack up your cameras and go . 
oh god it 's that bloody yank ! 
father it 's somewhere south - west of here - we need to inform the museum ... ˇ organize an expedition - 
father ... father ! 
i photographed it extensively father . 
a neolithic bronze ... reminiscent of the nias island cultures ... it ' s very curious . defiantly pagan . the use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... what do you think ? 
it ' s alright jack ... it ' s alright . 
you 're the animals - all of you ! 
he 's gon na die ! they 'll kill him ! 
jesus christ ! how could you do this to him ? how could you do this ? 
jack ! ...   jack ! 
no ! do n't ! 
give it back ! 
jack ! this is the archeological find of the century ! 
but . . . we can ' t jack i need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information . 
it 's the same image - kong ! 
there 's a light up ahead . 
i ca n't imagine you crying . 
i want to thank you . 
i do n't know what happened to you jack ... but i ca n't believe you were always this much of a bastard . 
can you fly ? 
i not doing this for me jack ! it 's for my father . this is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years ! it belongs to him ! i 'm going to that island ... nothing 's going to stop me ! 
where do i charter a boat ? 
god you 're so obnoxious ! our work happens to be of great anthropological value ! 
how dare you ? my father is the british museum 's most respected archeologist ! 
tell me mr driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down ? 
no it 's not ok ! we 're not about to be robbed blind by some two - bit hustler on the make ! 
he 's grubbing for money father . 
did he come around often ? 
arlyn just tell me did jane have a dumper one of her regular johns ? 
honey a couple of years ago with jane and frankie ? -- jane sent me a dumper -- 
arlyn he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about . 
she was with you after she left frank . 
trina honey he just wants to find arlyn page . 
uh uh . 
trina this is klute . i told you about him . 
and nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but i felt it stirring inside me this -- this wild pagan feeling -- 
not young ; he was n't young -- gray at the temples he -- well actually he looked like you . 
-- may i ? it 's so -- 
and then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well i just saw him . a stranger -- looking at me -- and i knew suddenly that all my life i 'd been -- 
and cannes was quite fun quite ; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly -- 
well -- well i 'm just back . and -- i must tell you -- something quite wonderful . 
it 's good to see you . well -- could we do it first and then just talk ? 
i said that .   well so you have a choice . you can either feel lonely -- you know the hate -- or --   so you take a call and go to a hotel room and there 's some john you 've never seen before but he wants you . he must he 's paying for it .   and usually they 're nervous and that 's all right too because you 're not ; you know this thing . and then for a while boy they really pay attention you 're all there is .   and it 's not real and you do n't have to even like them -- you can even hate them it 's all right it safe -- you know ? 
the truth is i hate them : they must hate me . all right the money .   all right not the money . a kind of put - on . it gets things back together .   well let 's say i 'd go to one of these cattle - calls a tryout . i mean before -- before i got this job -- and they 'd always say thank you very much and i 'd feel you know brought down . they did n't want me . 
well it 's more than loneliness . hate . people hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know ? i 'm all screwed up . 
do you always have to repeat ? 
all right . loneliness .   well -- separated . from other people . forgotten .   well as if i can be here i can go through the motions right ? but the truth is i do n't belong . 
i do not love him . 
i know : it 's ridiculous . but it 's tearing me up and i do n't know why . and look all right i came here did n't i ? and if i have to i 'll keep coming here the works and talk about my mummy and my daddy and i 'll even pay for it but will you kindly for god 's sakes say something ? 
look . i almost killed my -- i almost killed someone . 
look -- could i use your phone ? 
grunemann ? i 've looked at him a -- 
oh no . 
i do n't have to look at anything . i do n't have -- 
is that what he set me up for ? everything he 's told me from the beginning ? -- do n't worry do n't -- 
what was better ? i made better bait ? 
is that why klute did n't tell me ? 
why is n't he locked up ? 
you said someone killed them you said you know who you said that . 
arlyn and jane commited suicide . he said they commited suicide . 
so do i. 
oh well that should n't take you more than another oh two and a half or three years should it ? 
tell me . i 'll listen .   i just want you to tell me . 
i said yes i see . 
i 'm sorry i 'm just frightened . yes . 
if you 'll let me go i could tell them what -- 
will you let me go then ? 
yes -- jane mckenna 's book -- i could make a phone call . 
-- yes . 
yes -- all right -- 
can i carry something for you to the car ?   will you kiss me ? 
you do n't believe that either do you ? why ca n't you see my side ? 
look why should it be yes or no ? ca n't we keep it going and see ? i mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see . people do that that 's realistic . 
how can you not think so ? you know the things i can do . 
look at me . i 'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned and dear god i 'd tear your heart out ! 
look -- yes . i mean thanks but -- do n't you think we better be realistic ? 
you could at least look at me ! 
you wanted to or you are ? 
well suppose i had n't come downstairs . would you just have folded up and sneaked away ? 
you 're going back ? 
oh .   well it was n't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy - cheeked country boy . 
trask said i should move . let 's not make a thing of it . 
hey -- look officer -- i can explain everything . it was just -- you know everything all of a -- 
because i did n't want to be touched ! i did n't think you 'd get that ! 
how do you know how bad it was ? 
maybe i was n't there when you called . 
with trina . 
oh zippidy - doo they 'll find my fingerprints .   can i go in ? i need some stuff . 
ah schmendrick -- what 's the scam ? 
you said it was over right ? you said not to worry any more all over right ? 
right back at the start right ? 
my god i thought it was over . and here i am daddy right back at the start . 
oh look what he did in them . 
oh jesus . oh jesus . 
hell there 's nothing so mysterious about the square life . 
you and i -- a relationship . 
spangler says we have a relationship . 
well i told him i would n't - uh - go there any more .   i know it 's tough to understand but it was n't easy . you see he was nice to me . i mean it was n't just him . i got something out of it too i guess . anyway i told him i would n't go there anymore . 
is that all you have to say ? 
i saw mr. faber .   you remember mr. faber do n't you ? 
oh boy say you think you 're pretty good . 
no not just ' mm ' . you do n't know what i -- 
i am scared . the things i do . the things i could do to you . 
i 'm still scared .   i mean different but still .   look i made it very clear from the start you 're a yokel you do n't excite me you do n't even interest me and so i only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed ? 
no .   well all right . but you want to and i want you to and we both know it and all right . 
you get the christ out ! you dumb stupid bastard you do n't know anything you square you get out ! i do n't have to show you anything ; you get out ! 
arlyn was a junkie ; i 'm not on junk ! 
i told you before you would n't understand . 
i do n't get you . 
what if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along ? you could sit and read the national geographic . 
thanks for the jolly news . i thought maybe you 'd left town by now . you kind of just disappeared . but you boys from tuscarora have a habit of disappearing do n't you ? 
-- then you do n't need me . 
what the hell do you think 's the matter .   i could wait for you someplace . 
i can make that in a lunch break !   look hiram you 're sure it is n't just me ? -- you decided you liked it after all the other night ; you 'll hang around for seconds ? 
arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she 's the one who started frank . she 's strung out now ; you wo n't find her . 
frankie kept them in the same apartment : it cut his travel - time . 
arlyn page . 
well what 're you down about ? you mean because you did n't get me there ?   you ca n't expect that . i mean frank yes he 'd get me there all the time -- but never with a john . 
what 's the matter hon ? you were great . terrific . a tiger . 
oh do n't be all hypocrite . or do you really like other kicks ? is it more just having power over someone ? -- so you do n't really need to -- 
so you 're not too different from him or the chap on the roof or tommy - baby -- 
ezra i 'm lots better than you 're used to . tell me -- the other night watching me with mr. faber -- was n't your tongue a little bit hanging out ? 
oh do n't be a doo - doo . 
it got lonely upstairs . there 's someone on the roof . 
-- us city folks ? the sin the glitter the wickedness ? 
hey but did we get to you klute ? a little ? 
oh -- wait -- oh i get it . you said that just to keep me scared . so i 'd tell you everything i -- oh clever ; oh you smart tricky hick . 
you said it was ! 
what do i do meanwhile ? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me ? 
what 're you gon na do next ? 
is there anything more i could -- 
oh golly oh just what i 've always dreamed of dirty phone calls .   how come ? 
i thought you were going back to the apartment . 
well -- she 's dead . 
about the dumper did n't he tell you that ? 
did n't he tell you what you wanted ? 
did you like my friend frankie ? 
what did you expect ? frankie still has a good string three girls . figure three hundred a week from each . 
he never told me . 
you asked me where i got that date with the dumper -- frank sent me on it . 
ca n't you get him ? 
well do you think it was him ? 
you go see agents -- or equity calls open casting calls . and ad agencies -- commercials -- you do n't get work you just go around . 
i go on rounds . 
you 've changed your mind ? you do want to play ? 
i thought you could trick me for those tapes . do n't you get lonely in that little green room ? or let me get you someone ; i have terrific friends wild . 
what ? this ? 
mm ? oh he was my old man . we broke up . 
gee i hope this does n't make my cold any worse . 
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards . 
-- you want to wear women 's clothes or you get off ripping things -- 
klute tell me what 's your bag ? are you a talker or a button man or a doubler or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high - heeled shoes or have us watch you tinkle ? or -- 
look i 'm sure this 'll amuse you too . ilia trying to get away from all that . 
you 're very square . pimps do n't get you dates cookie ; they just take the money . 
how would i remember ? 
most of them . 
look -- i 'm sorry -- i 've led everybody wrong . i mean yes i get those feelings but that 's just me that 's just feelings .   i 'm sure this will amuse you ; i 'm scared of the dark . and sometimes i get shook up i hear people or -- well i 'll come out in the morning and think someone 's been prying at my mailbox or there 's a little -- trash outside my door and i wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see ? -- things other people would n't even notice . well that 's not real it 's just nerves ; it 's got nothing to do with -- 
just phone calls right ? they ring you answer they do n't say anything just blank . kids getting kicks . burglars looking for an empty apartment . i mean there is nothing that proves -- 
well could i have them back now hon ? -- those tape recordings you 've got downstairs -- ok ? -- and if you want you can have a good time and i 'll have a good time and-- 
i ca n't say he was anybody ! 
nothing . except he was n't kidding . usually it 's a fakeout you probably know . they pretend to tie you up and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --   hell it 's their money . i 'll hang from the shower rod and whistle maytime . except this guy was really tripped out on it ; he -- 
you remind me of my uncle . 
all right yes i had been . those sick wild letters -- i 'm watching you gon na follow you gon na punish you kill you et cetera . well they said all right that 's grunemann . so try to remember when you and he - when -- well i do n't know there was that dumper once he sounded like that dumper --   dumpers ; they get their kicks beating you up . a man hired me once then tried to really kill me - that 'd be about two years ago . 
a name . grunemann . nothing . and they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing . then they asked me well had i been getting letters from someone out there in cabbageville -- 
is n't that sweet .   well it could be any one of them bubi ; i get to see them all . 
or you 'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean ; another month with the bull - dykes . 
if i was taking calls full time would i be living in this kip ? i 'd be back on park avenue ; i could support the whole national guard ! 
is it the shakedown hon ? you picked a loser i just do n't have it . 
and you just want to ask me a few questions ? 
you 're not police or fbi ; you 're just a private investigator ? 
dew yew hayuv ah - dentifikyshun ? 
you said that . 
what about ? 
what is it ? 
because my son is here .   and his father is here .   as a mother i do n't want my child to be separated from his father . 
yes ... look during the last five years we were married i had ... i was getting more and more ... unhappy more and more frustrated .   i needed to talk to somebody .   i needed to find out if it was me if i was going crazy or what .   but every time i turned to ted -- my ex - husband he could n't handle it .   he became very ... i do n't know very threatened .   i mean when- ever i would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack .   anyway we became more and more separate ... more and more isolated from one another .   finally i had no other choice i had to leave . and because of my ex - husband 's attitude -- his unwillingness to deal with my feelings i had come to have almost no self- esteem ...   at the time i left i sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me -- that my son would be better off without me .   it was only when i got to california and started into therapy i began to realize i was n't a terrible person .   and that just because i needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child that did n't make me unfit to be a mother . 
yes .   very much . 
i make thirty - one thousand dollars a year . 
yes i work for jantzen as a sportswear designer . 
yes .   i tried to talk to ted-- my ex - husband -- about it but he would n't listen .   he refuses to discuss it in any serious way . i remember one time he said i probably could n't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for billy . 
no i did not . 
the first couple yes but after that it became increasingly difficult . 
six years . 
i consider it less my failure than his . 
i was not a failure . 
we were married two years before the baby .   and then four very difficult years . 
i suppose ... 
i ... i do n't know ... 
somewhere in between . 
i do n't recall . 
i do n't recall . 
okay ... i think i 'll go talk to my son now .   how do i look ? 
only can i still see him ? 
he 's already got one mother he does n't need two ... he 's yours ...   i wo n't fight you for him any more . he 's yours ... 
please ... please do n't stop me . this is the hardest thing i 've ever had to do .. 
ted when we got married it was because i was twenty - seven years old and i thought i should get married and ... when i had billy it was because i thought i should have a baby ... and i guess all i did was mess up my life and your life and-- 
ted do you love him ? 
ted do you love him ? 
please ted .   i never would have brought it up if i thought-- 
i 'm sorry ... i just mentioned it in passing .   i never thought he 'd use it . 
ted if you ca n't discuss this rationally-- 
ted all my life i 'd either been somebody 's daughter or somebody 's wife or somebody else 's mother . then all of a sudden i was a thirty - two - year - old highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child .   i went to california because that was about as far away as i could get .   only ... i guess it was n't far enough . so i started going to a shrink .   ted i 've had time to think . i 've been through some changes . i 've learned a lot about myself . 
ted listen to me ... you and i we had a really crappy marriage--   look do n't get so defensive okay ?   it was probably as much my fault as it was yours ... anyway when i left i was really screwed up-- 
i want my son .   i 'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street . i want my son . 
ted ... the reason i wanted to see you ... i want billy back . 
watching my son ... ted i 've been living in new york for the past two months . 
he looks like a terrific kid . 
a few times .   sometimes i sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school . 
i 've seen him . 
you ca n't tell it from a distance ted . 
yes ... how 's billy ? 
how 's the new job ? 
hello ted .   you look well . 
i do n't know ... 
no! ... please ... please do n't make me stay ... i swear ... if you do sooner or later ... maybe tomorrow maybe next week ... maybe a year from now ...   i 'll go right out the window . 
i am not !   i 'm a terrible mother ! i 'm an awful mother .   i yell at him all the time .   i have no patience .   no ... no .   he 's better off without me .   ted i 've got to go ... i've got to go . 
ted i can't ... i tried ... i really tried but ... i just ca n't hack it anymore ... 
i 'm not taking him with me . 
no you did n't .   you did n't even ask about billy . 
you just do n't get it do you ?   i - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you . 
ted you 're not listening to me . it 's over finished . 
look it 's not your fault okay ? it 's me .   it 's my fault -- you just married the wrong person . 
i 've paid the rent the con - ed and the phone bill so you do n't have to worry about them . 
here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning .   they 'll be ready on saturday . 
i took two thousand out of the savings account .   that was what i had in the bank when we got married . 
my american express ... my bloomingdale 's credit card ... my check book-- 
ted i 'm leaving you . 
i 'm going to take it . 
i 've been offered a job in washington with h.e.w. 
kramer ... there 's something i ought to tell you . 
kramer i 'm sorry .   all i was trying to do was-- 
oh for god 's sake kramer . you have got to be the world 's most naive human being .   murray has gone in and changed every single ad you 've done on the entire fire and ice campaign . every layout ... every idea ... every single thing right down the line . 
you dope .   o'connor does n't give a damn about billy .   all he wants is somebody that 'll hang around with him every night so he wo n't have to go home . 
you want to know why ?   i 'll tell you why ...   another scotch and soda for the gentleman .   i 'll tell you exactly why . because you 're not his buddy anymore .   because he ca n't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him . 
o'connor 's out to get you .   he 's going to take the fire and ice account away from you . 
he wanted to know if i liked fried chicken . 
kramer i 've got to go .   i 've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on centre street . 
yes i 'll have dinner with you . 
it 's beautiful .   it 's just beautiful . they have a beautiful relationship . 
charley my husband and i are ... divorced and kim that 's our daughter is about billy 's age and the children play together a lot .   so i guess we see each three or four times a week . 
six years .   ever since ted and joanna moved into the building . 
ted i just heard ... 
maybe .   i said maybe .   what i mean is ah ... i do n't think it 'll really work out but charley seems to want it so ... 
ah charley and i are ... well we 're thinking about ... i mean actually we 're sort of talking about maybe getting back together . 
you heard anything yet ? 
me ? !   you want me to take care of billy ? ! 
do n't say that !   i do n't want to hear you say that ! 
i told her you 're doing a 
uh huh ... yeah ... 
uh huh ... she said she had a good job was playing a lot of tennis .   she wanted to know all about billy . 
not for a couple of months . the last time i heard from her she was living in san francisco . 
look   i know this is n't gon na make any sense okay ?   i mean forget the logic part ... but i keep thinking if charley really loved me he would n't have let me divorce him . 
no .   i do n't think so . 
three .   and add some basil . 
lenox hill .   77th street between park and lex .   the emergency number is 327 - 0800 . 
you 're sure ? 
you 're on your own understand ? 
i 've got enough trouble raising my own kid .   i do n't need another one .   got it ? 
all right ... okay ... but let 's get something straight right now . i mean i 'm sorry about what happened between you and joanna but it 's not my problem understand ? 
look this is nothing personal but i do n't think you can do it . 
i mean what are you going to do about billy ? 
what are you going to do ? 
ted divorce is a terrible thing . i know i went through it . you 've got to believe i did everything i could to get joanna to stay .   but i 'll tell you something . you may not want to hear it but it took a lot of courage for joanna to do what she just did . 
maybe she did n't feel like she should have to .   maybe she felt like if you 'd been paying any real attention to her to start with maybe you would 've noticed . 
oh for shit 's sake ted you are the most selfish human being i have ever met .   no wonder she said you came first then billy then if there was anything left over she got the scraps . 
what d'you know about how joanna felt ?   you went off to an office every morning and you 'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell . 
i mean ... things .   ted joanna 's very unhappy and-- 
ted joanna and i used to talk a lot and ... well she told me a lot of ... ah things about the two of you . 
ted do n't be so hostile . 
ohmygod .   did n't she say anything ? she must 've said something . 
ted all i wanted to know was where-- 
look ted all i-- 
yeah .   thanks to you . 
yeah you got bit .   i 'm gon na fix it . 
you 're gon na be okay . 
you 're not okay your leg 's a mess . 
and how would we neutralize him ? 
they could try to tranq him on land . 
can i tell them you wo n't go back in the water ? 
oh bullshit . 
i 'm no psychiatrist .   but i would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy than-- 
excuse me ?

< u > did</u > you want to be killed by it ?

we seem to say goodnight a lot . 
maybe .   i 've always < u > read</u > about what 's happened .   i 've never ... i know it sounds silly but it 's nice to be someplace < u > while</u > something is actually ... y'know ... happening . 
what ?   why ... people have been killed i hardly think i 'm having a good time why would ...   does it show ? 
keep it dry .   no swimming . 
father 's a surgeon .   i can even stitch in a pinch would n't be a bad idea here .

i wonder if he 's some kind of mutant .   that bear had to be surprised . 
yeah .   i got some stuff for your cut . 
why he 's that < u > big</u > i do n't know . why he 's < u > here</u > ... the wetlands are being developed crocodiles are moving .   australia fiji the things have started to cross oceans . 
a man just died you 're hitting on me with science . 
you < u > did</u > you-- 
we 're staying in < u > tents</u > ? 
what is with this lake ?   it looks black and ... there are no waves or anything .

did he say anything ? 
< u > i</u > < u > am</u > < u > not</u > < u > going</u > < u > to</u > < u > maine</u > .   that 's ridiculous . 
i never do field work and even if i did < u > maine</u > to look at a tooth of a < u > dinosaur</u > who bit somebody could n't you dream up something-- 
this was myra 's idea was n't it ? get me out of the office for a few days until-- 
i 'm not even a field person . 
i 'm not going to maine i wo n't even go west of forty - third street-- 
are you on drugs ? 
this is what we do ? 
oh well then i 'm sure that 's it he got killed by a dinosaur anything else ? 
a tooth ?

kevin hey .

i 'm not upset myra okay .   i just never thought of you as a y'know ... 
you do n't know what to say lucky for you action speaks louder than words . 
you and kevin . 
< u > you</u > ? 
< u > you</u > ?

i do n't like to be scared myra i have a thing about fright do n't ever scare me . 
well you < u > shouldn't</u > have .   how did you even know where i was . 
what do you expect mugging me from behind ? 
agent mapp ! thank you ! 
he knew her ... ! 
but why ? he did n't weight the others . 
fredrica bimmel from belvedere ohio . the first girl taken but the third body found ... why ? 
what girl ? 
but there is no pattern . there 's no connection at all among these places or the computers would 've nailed it ! they 're even found in random order . 
he 's here ardelia . 
the worst part - the thing that 's making me crazy - is that bill is right in front of me . only i ca n't see him ...   lecter said everything i need to catch him is right here in these pages ... 
it would be rude . and he would n't get to ask any more questions ... 
no . he wo n't come after me . 
somebody 's coaching her ... they 're trying to make him see catherine as a person - not just an object . 
boy is that smart ... 
pleading with a crazy man with come all over my face . 
thanks ardelia . 
what 'd i do ? 
never cock . just squeeze . 
i will ... i promise . 
i 'll need the big fingerprint kit ... and the one - to - one polaroid the cu- 5 with film packs and batteries . 
shut up !   the other officers will be here any minute ! you 're perfectly safe now ! 
catherine . listen to me . i have to find a rope . i have to leave this room just for a minute but - 
i 'll get you out ! just be quiet so i can hear . shut that dog up .   is there a ladder ? is there a rope ? 
you 're all right ! where is he ? 
fbi catherine you 're safe . 
dr. chilton i told you - this is just routine follow - up on the raspail case . 
but then i would 've missed the pleasure of your company . 
dr. chilton - if lecter feels you 're his enemy - as you 've said - then maybe i 'll have more luck by myself . what do you think ? 
i understand . 
i graduated magna from uva doctor . it 's not a charm school . 
how do you mean dr. chilton ? 
i 'm sure it 's a great town dr. chilton but my instructions are to talk to lecter and report back this afternoon . 
but then he had to cover up make her seem just like all the rest of them . that 's what lecter was hinting ! 
maybe he lives in this this belvedere ohio too ! maybe he saw her every day and killed her sort of spontaneously . maybe he just meant to ... give her a 7 - up and talk about the choir . but then - 
yes sir . i can find it by myself . 
mr. krendler ... dr. lecter trusts me . or at least he used to . if i could just - 
i need the id to fly with my gun . the gun belongs in quantico . 
sir mr. crawford instructed me - 
not yet ! - just wait for me .   maybe in about two seconds . 
mr. yow ? oh mr. yow ... ? it looks like somebody is sitting in this car . 
that was n't me . 
okay mr. yow ... 
good idea . 
mr. yow if this door should fall down -ha ha ! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number ? it 's our baltimore field office . they know you 're here with me ... do you understand ? 
i wo n't disturb anything mr. yow i promise . be gone before you know it . 
did she leave any records here ? tax or business records ? maybe a list of employees ? 
mr. gordon did you take over this place after mrs. lippman died ? 
i think we may be yes . 
mr. gordon did you know fredrica when she worked for mrs. lippman ? 
i 'm investigating the death of fredrica bimmel . who are you please ? 
excuse me but i really do need to talk to you . this was mrs. lippman 's house . did you know her ? 
yes sir . thank you sir ... 
yes sir ... i 'll do my best . 
chicago 's only about 400 miles from here . i could be there in - 
sir that 's great news . but how - 
that 's why they 're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin ! he keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin so that - 
he 's got a real taste for it now . and he 's getting better at his work . 
what he does with them - takes privacy ... time tools ... he 's in his 30 's or 40 's - he 's got real physical strength but combined with an older man 's self - control . he 's cautious precise never impulsive ... this wo n't end in suicide like they often do . 
he 's a white male ... serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group . and he 's not a drifter - he 's got his own house somewhere . not an apartment . 
there 's no correlation at all between where they 're kidnapped and where they 're found ... ?   what if - what if you trace the heaviest - traffic routes backwards from the dump sites ? do they converge at all ? 
i 'm here sir i just - i do n't know how to feel about it . 
murdered ... ? how ? 
sir what is it ? there 's something you 're not telling me . 
to complete and file my report by 0800 wednesday . but sir - 
sir that 's a field job . it 's outside the scope of my assignment . and i 've got a test tomorrow on - 
right down to the kleenex i used .   sir why ? is something wrong ? 
it 's all there sir practically verbatim . 
and what is that sir ? 
yes sir . 
yes well ... okay right . i 'm glad for the chance sir but - why me ? 
who 's the subject ? 
not yet . 
i hope so . they have n't posted anything . 
good morning mr. crawford . 
dr. lecter ... 
and there 's no way - no natural way - these could 've wound up in the bodies ? 
not lately . but maybe someday . 
i try to be a student dr. pilcher . 
sometimes you do . 
i think so . 
where does mrs. lippman live ? i 'd like to talk to her . 
did you ever work with her ? 
stacy did fredrica ever mention a man named jamie gumb ? or john grant ?   do you think she could 've had a friend you did n't know about ? 
you know i ca n't make that promise . 
dr. lecter - 
yes . i 'll tell you . 
tell me his name dr. lecter . 
yes ! i do n't know ... ! i do n't know . 
i did n't get more than a few miles before the sheriff 's car found me . the rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the lutheran orphanage in bozeman . i never saw the ranch again ... 
i do n't know . i had no food or water . it was very cold . i thought - if i can even save just one ... but he got so heavy . so heavy ... 
i took one lamb . and i ran away as fast as i could ... 
no . first i tried to free them ... i opened the gate of their pen - but they would n't run . they just stood there confused . they would n't run ... 
yes ... ! they were screaming . 
got dressed without turning on the light . i went downstairs ... outside ... 
i heard a strange sound ... 
early . still dark . 
nobody sent me . i came on my own . 
i thought you might want your drawings back ... just until you get your view . 
yes doctor . please . 
how would he test ? 
on what basis would they reject him ? 
you said - i was very close to the way we 'd catch him . 
no ... ! quid pro quo doctor . 
i - ran away ... 
two months . 
horses - and sheep ... 
i went to live with my mother 's cousin and her husband in montana . they had a ranch . 
no . tell me why . 
dr. lecter there 's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence . transsexuals are very passive . 
quid pro quo doctor . 
no . he was strong he lasted almost a month . my mother - died when i was very young so my father had become - the whole world to me ... after he left me i had nobody . i was ten years old . 
he was a town marshal ... one night he surprised two burglars coming out the back of a drugstore ... they shot him . 
the death of my father . 
go doctor . 
that 's just part of the island . it has a very nice beach . terns nest there . 
a moth ... how did you predict that ? 
she had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat . that has n't been made public yet . we do n't know what is means . 
they all were . 
by the book he 's a sadist . 
i was your choice dr. lecter . you chose to speak to me . would you prefer someone else now ? or perhaps you do n't think you can help us . 
buffalo bill ... ?   bill killed him all those years ago ... ? that 's impossible . 
who killed your patient ? 
who killed raspail doctor ... ? you know do n't you ? 
i do n't know . is it ? 
that does n't interest me doctor . and it 's the sort of thing miggs would ask . 
i never thought about it . 
i do n't know . next time i 'll have to check . 
because you were n't wasting my time . 
scared at first . then - exhilarated . 
would n't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find ? 
if you did n't kill him then who did ? 
why ? do you know something about him ? 
how did -   it 's nothing . a scratch . 
what 's that dr. lecter ? 
then please - do this test for me . 
and the questionnaire ... ? 
reasonably so . yes . 
you see a lot dr. lecter . but are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself ? how about it ... ? look at yourself and write down the truth .   or maybe you 're afraid to . 
no . i only hoped that your knowledge - 
no . you ate yours . 
it excites him . most serial killers keep some sort of trophies . 
i 'll tell you if you 'll look at this form .   it started as a bad joke in kansas city homicide . they said ... this one likes to skin his humps . 
partially yes . but doctor that 's an active case i 'm not involved . if - 
five ... so far . 
no i came because we need - 
i 'm only asking you to look at this doctor . either you will or you wo n't . 
dr. lecter if you 'd please consider - 
all that detail just from memory ... ? 
did you do those drawings doctor ? 
maybe they 'll catch up . 
doctor we have a hard problem in psychological profiling . i want to ask for your help with a questionnaire . 
why did they turn back ? 
what ? ! 
he did ? 
you were acting for our benefit . and i apologize . i misunderstood you . 
you knew them . 
why did n't you bury those people ? 
i will not . i have seen the face of war before mr. poe but never war made on women and children . and almost as cruel is your indifference . 
though they are strangers they are at least entitled to a christian burial ! 
yes i do ! i know exactly what i am saying .   and if it is sedition then i am guilty of sedition too ! 
he knew the consequences . and he stayed .   are those the actions of a criminal ?   ... duncan do something . 
there was no letter . 
there was none ! 
when ? how ? 
what are they doing to duncan ? duncan ! 
yes . go ahead . 
you know he would n't send me ... ! you misrepresented what you saw and caused this .   i too was at that farm . it was as he said ... 
beyond the periphery of men staring at him . 
i am sorry duncan ... 
duncan ...   duncan i promised you an answer . you have complimented me with your persistence and patience ... but the decision i 've come to is i 'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment . 
he delivered no such message . 
my god alice . 
yes . yes i will . 
cousin eugenie my father but ... 
some say that 's the way of it . 
dear duncan my affection is as towards a closest friend . alice and i depend on you and respect you immensely ... i wish they did but my feelings do n't go beyond that . do you see ? 
you still have an aversion to the water ? 
i 'm embarrassed to be so indecisive ... after so long apart and after you 've traveled so far ... 
it hit me !   where are they ? ! 
we made it ! 
ca n't we fix it ? 
how much time does that give us ? 
seeing how my stock 's doing ... 
maybe they already have . 
they know do n't they ? 
the escape bubbles ? 
what can we do ? 
maybe you 're more one of us than you think ... sir . 
has it helped ? 
i need electrical field experience on my resume . everything helps ...   why are you here ? 
good ... it 's going good . 
why ?   you going to give me hard time like the others ? 
after a month of it you 'd think i 'd be used to it . 
you screw around like that again and-- 
roger ...   more light sixpack ... 
still ... you did the right thing . 
today ... with dejesus .   that was smart thinking to get him inside ... 
you did good ... 
you take your money too seriously bo . 
i signed - up for the stock option . 
how 's transocean doing ? 
made your million yet ? 
i 'm not touching you ! 
it saw us ! 
who 's the best power forward in the nba ... jameson ? 
are you okay jonesy ? 
well why have n't they answered our flares ? 
are you sure you saw something ? 
do n't spend all day down there . 
the shack ... 
what is it ? 
what is it ? 
cobb 's cut ... it was in him ! it got doc ... 
it needs blood ? 
what 's wrong ? 
what on earth 's the matter with you ? 
how is he ? 
who were you talking to ? 
what is it ? 
hey jonesy who 's the best power forward in the nba ... jameson ? 
clear for pickup . 
sorry darling ... just thought a little humor would loosen us all up ... you know ? ... 
your pocket ? 
two years at hard labor our lady of perpetual help . 
i said pretty much the same thing to my mother when i was your age . 
if you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was i would be happy ! i would be thrilled . 
that is n't true . 
i think you can learn whatever you want to . i just do n't see you doing it . if you want to settle for-- 
you can fix old cars . mr. washburn told me that the cars they 're making now are all computerized-- 
how do you think you 're going to make a living ? 
save your breath . that line does n't cut it with me . 
that makes it okay ? 
do n't try to con me amado . you knew how they got all those things . 
so i 'm worried about you . i do n't want you to end up in jail like your friends . 
--you're going to be on your own . 
i 'm only going to have you for two more years . if you decide not to go on to college-- 
leave your sister out of it . 
oh come on amado-- 
you 'll find out when i get you home . thanks sam . 
i 'm unmarried . i 'm not available . 
the sheriff . 
all my mother does is work . that 's how you get to be spanish . 
sure they go back to cortez . when he rode by they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner . 
spanish please . my mother would have a heart attack . 
what ? become a nun ? you did n't want me going out with anglos-- 
you made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody . 
thank you . 
nobody 's too busy . 
there must have been somebody . 
how come you never got married again ? 
right . when he was killed . 
mami how old were you when my father-- 
oh come on -- you must be curious how it 's changed . amado is into this big tejano roots thing and i 've never been further than ciudad leon-- 
no . i was wondering if you 'd like to take a trip down south with us . maybe see where you grew up-- 
if you spent a little more time training them-- 
well you hire illegals-- 
maybe you 're just getting less patient . 
i have new respect for some of my kids meeting the parents they 've been dealt-- 
i do n't think you can take it personally-- 
he 's going to wish he was dead . 
okay ? he 's not here ? 
oh my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys . 
i only went for my last two years . 
enough with the clothes-- 
nobody really wears that stuff paloma . 
yeah . i had uhm -- school business . 
it 's saturday . 
what do you think ? 
for a while . 
it does n't have anything to do with being smart . 
of course you can . 
everything that went before all that stuff that history -- the hell with it right ? 
we start from scratch-- 
i 'm not having any more children . after amado i had some complications-- i ca n't get pregnant again if that 's what the rule is about-- 
from the first time i saw you at school -- all those years we were married to other people i always felt like we were connected . 
they ca n't pull this on me . it is n't fair -- i do n't believe this-- 
i 've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before .   did n't know she owned one . 
couple months before i was born-- 
she 'll figure it out sooner or later . i do n't have to ask permission anymore if that 's what you mean . 
eladio . eladio . cruz . 
it is n't . not by a long shot . he holds her and they lie silently for a moment-- 
like your story is over . 
there 's nothing on the walls . no pictures-- 
how long have you lived here ? 
so what are we gon na do about this ? 
how come it feels the same ? 
when nando died -- it was so sudden -- i was kind of in shock for awhile . then i woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and i did n't have any idea what to do with it . 
i mean what did we know about anything ? 
i look at my kids in school -- tenth eleventh graders . that 's who we were . children . 
we thought we were something did n't we ? 
looks real bad if the teacher 's late for class . it 's really nice to talk with you sam . 
i should get back . 
they 've got me . different thing . 
it can happen so sudden ca n't it ? being left out on your own . 
you do n't want to be sheriff . 
so why did you come back here sam ? 
fernando was n't pissed off at everybody . he just wanted to fix their cars . 
with paloma it 's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate . but amado -- he's -- he 's never been book - smart . had a hard time learning to read . me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment -- like a betrayal . 
he hates me . 
weird what you remember . 
i was on the playground with all the other kids but i thought he was only looking at me . i was afraid he was going to arrest me -- he had those eyes you know-- 
i remember him watching me once . when i was little -- before you and i-- 
people liked him . 
i thought you got through that pretty well . 
so she tells me three times a week . 
a real palace . she rattles around alone in that thing-- 
i ca n't name anybody she does like these days . 
lunch hour . my next class is n't till nine - thirty . 
are you okay ? 
we have n't talked since high school . 
somebody called -- something about an electronics store . 
they 've got my amado . 
thank you sir . 
yes sir . 
no sir . they all been real straight with me . 
no sir . not at all . 
they got people to fight . arabs yellow people whatever . might as well use us . 
outside it's -- it 's such a mess -- it's-- 
i do sir . 
i mean follow orders sir . 
work hard be good at your job . sir . do whatever they tell you . 
it 's their country . this is one of the best deals they offer . 
you really want to know sir ? 
the -- the officers . 
follow orders . do whatever they say . 
i am sir . 
i - i can do the job sir . 
i 'm sorry sir . 
thank you sergeant major . 
thank you sergeant major . 
will this go on my record ? 
out of the army ?

i 'm sorry sergeant major . there was n't anything i could do . shadow gets crazy-- 
from back in houston . we both come up on fifth street . 
yes sergeant . 
you 're testing me ? 
i 'm feeling okay-- 
i know that sergeant . we were just dancing . there was a bunch of us there . shadow just come down looking for trouble . 
we were just dancing-- 
if i had i would n't have gone in . 
thanks . i like it when you say that sam . 
this boy from west side plays tackle both ways . bench - presses 350 pounds . you imagine having that much weight on top of you ? pushing down ? be hard to breathe . hard to swallow . 
350 pounds . 
no it was n't was it ? you did n't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul did you ? 
you kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke did n't you sam ? all that time we were first seeing each other you did n't know i was tightly wound-- 
you watch the draft this year ? ' course you did n't idiot question . they try to make it dramatic like there 's some big surprise who picks who in the first round ? only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months . doctor 's reports highlight reels coaches ' evaluations psychological profiles -- hell i would n't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys have 'em analyzed . all this stuff to pick a football player for your squad . compared to that what you know about the person you get married to do n't amount to diddly does it ? 
yeah . sort of . daddy rounds 'em up . you are n't talking about money their beady little eyes go dead . 
you look awful good in that uniform though . 
--they had n't pulled me off that woman i would have jerked a knot in her . 
--and that squeaker the aggies dropped to oklahoma - sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal-- 
last year was awful rough -- mama passing on and the whole business with o.j.--i mean it 's not like it was don meredith or roger staubach or one of our own boys but it really knocked me for a loop-- 
do i seem jumpy ? 
oh . right . and you 're in-- ? 
the longhorns gon na kick some serious butt this saturday you just watch . we got a kid at tailback from down your way -- outta el indio-- 
do n't worry about it . he owes me some favors . 
a casa de porfirio zayas . he used to be a doctor on the other side . gunshot wounds fixing babies -- if you can pay he can handle it . 
rapidamente ! everybody in the world is going to see ! 
this girl has a child ? 
i thought you were married ! 
this girl is a friend of yours ? 
you think you 're doing these people a favor ? what are they going to do ? either they get on welfare or they become criminals-- 
enrique ! quienes son estos ? how could you bring them here ? 
do n't tell me lies enrique . que paso ? 
you have somebody else out there ? 
in english enrique . we 're in the united states-- 
what are you doing out there ? are you crazy ? 
quien es ? [ who is it ? ] 
good night enrique . she slides into the car-- 
en ingles enrique . this is the united states . we speak english . 
i never said that . it was just that boy-- 
i felt that you could do better for yourself-- 
i never said that . 
i do n't mean fernando . 
maybe now . it was different back then . i had this place i was doing all the shopping all the cooking . what do i need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit ? 
i was too busy . 
a little older than paloma is now . 
he was killed . 
you want to see mexicans open your eyes and look around you . we 're up to our ears in them . 
why would i want to go there ? 
did you come here to tell me how to run my business ? 
nobody is illegal in my cafe ! they 've got green cards they 've got relatives who were born here -- if they only had a little common sense i 'd be very happy . 
if they 're going to survive here they have to know how to work elalco ! adelante ! los clientes esperan ! 
these ones coming up are getting stupider every year . 
not if they was colored or meskin . not if they wanted to keep breathin ' . 
sheriff buddy was a different story . long as roderick throw his weight the right way on election day make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then if you was polite -- maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then things was peaceful . that sheriff wade though he took an awful big bite . 
them days you deal with sheriff wade or you did n't deal at all . first of the month every month he remind you of who you really workin ' for . 
not if i can help it . 
we run that twenty - odd years . give it over to otis payne in 1967 . april . 
i wo n't say nothing bad about the man but you can ask away . 
well do n't ever start up on 'em cause once you do you ca n't stop . i tell myself i 'm gon na play just three little games after breakfast and here i sit with half the day gone . 
you ever play one of these ? 
sheriff deeds ' dead honey -- you just sheriff junior . 
that 's me . 
what is he ? 
and you think he 'll be in a fit state to resurrect after thirteen years ? 
why did you wait so long ? 
jesus .   valentin .   what did you do to your face ? 
is it finished ? 
do n't look . 
i 'm here harry . 
you ca n't . 
oh god ! 
are you all right ? 
what was that ? 
and pimm and swann .   only nix was ready for them . 
i was twelve .   nix took me hostage to get swann to come to him . 
i know .   i 'm the one who shot him . 
are you sure ? 
i was so afraid . 
no it is n't .   you ca n't help me . 
i was grateful to him .   i owed him my life .   and he loved me . he could n't always show it but he felt it . 
i was n't . 
i told you -- 
some or it . 
he could get into people 's heads . make them see things . terrible things .   and he could levitate . juggle fire . 
swann said he could do stuff yes . 
it was more than that i think . 
oh christ . 
what did you find ? 
flesh is a trap .   that 's what he used to say .   flesh is a trap and magic sets us free .   why did you come back ? 
yes .   you do that . 
it does n't ring a bell .   i have to go . 
yes ... i 'm here .   and no .   i do n't know the name . 
that 's my business . harry . 
he ... did n't have me ..   i told you- 
they were jealous of him . 
how did it go today ? 
yes .   i think you probably can .   we 'd need to talk about your fee . 
they wo n't tell you anything . 
i do n't know where you 'd start . 
i heard what happened .   it looks like somebody murdered him . 
you have n't seen anything yet . 
i did n't marry him for love mr. d'amour .   tonight ? 
come to the show with me . tonight i want you to see him with an audience .   they love him . 
that 's not what i 'm asking for . i want somebody who can find out what philip saw in those damn cards . and stop it from happening . 
will you take the job mr. d'amour ? 
no .   you 're right .   he could have been something more . maybe a lot more .   but people get lost .   even good people . too much fame .   too much money 
you do n't believe me . 
we would n't be having this conversation if i did n't . swann 's one of the most remarkable men alive . 
we have n't slept in the same bed for years . 
we do n't share our lives the way a lot of people do . 
he 's a secretive man . 
i do n't exactly know . philip does n't like to talk about the past . 
i think we make our own futures . 
yes .   they were n't close but they saw each other once in a while .   i think philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards . 
i want you to help me help my husband .   i know he 's in some kind of trouble .   and it 's something to do with the man you saw murdered . 
what about me ? 
harm to whom ?   me ?   i do n't think so .   try him again at the hotel . 
no word from d'amour ? 
you saw this ? 
sure .   you want me to find out about quaid ?   i mean the funeral ? 
oh god . 
... they believe you . 
bad show last night ? 
i 'll miss you . 
ok bye . 
well ... have a good flight . 
you 're leaving right now ? 
just saying good - bye to everyone before you leave ? 
uh yeah ... i 'll bring it down . 
hi bob . 
i do n't know it just does n't reality changes things .... we ca n't stay here forever unless maybe we started a jazz band . 
i know . but it does n't last you have to go back sometime . 
well i mean it more now . 
i 'm going to miss you . 
when are you leaving ? 
that lunch was the worst huh . 
a coke . 
well i guess she 's more around your age ...   you guys could talk about things in common like growing up in the fifties . 
you ca n't get sushi anywhere in japan after 2 o'clock . did you know that ? 
oh i guess you 're busy huh . 
i 'm going to daikanyama do you want to come walk around ? 
you think so ? 
it 's bad is n't it ? 
i do n't know i think maybe i broke it ? i knocked into something the other day ... 
fuck off . 
oh she 'll love it . 
how old is she ? 
you made it . 
why do you have to be with your opposite why ca nt similar people be together ? 
i know but that 's what you like about me . 
john thinks i 'm so snotty . 
in d.c. my dad was the ambassador to france in the eighties so we went to school in paris for a few years ... but we mostly lived in d.c. and they were never around ... and then i moved to los angeles when john and i got married ... it 's so different there . 
that 's nice . my parents were always traveling they were n't around so much . 
no one ever tells you that ... 
that 's too scary . 
did that help ? did you learn anything ? 
and marriage does that get easier ? 
but i 'm mean . 
i just do n't know what i 'm supposed to be . i thought maybe i wanted to be a writer ... but i hate what i write and i tried taking pictures but john 's so good at that and mine are so mediocre ... and every girl goes through a photography phase like horses you know dumb pictures of your feet ... 
yeah ? but look at you . 
i 'm stuck . does it get easier . 
i know . 
oh for her show ? 
oh .   well ... they were dancing on the couch with that weird english guy who kept talking about hanging out with the sex pistols on kings road ... 
did you see hiromix last night dancing with bambi ? 
let 's never come here again because it would never be as much fun . 
why do they switch the r 's and l 's here ? 
i do n't remember . 
did i scowl at you ? 
do you remember when we met at the bar ? ... you were wearing a tuxedo . 
how 'd a japanese guy get a name like hans ? 
i think he kind of liked me ... is that so hard to imagine ? 
hey look it 's sausalito . 
ok see you downstairs . 
do you want to have some breakfast ? 
thanks for getting me back in one piece . 
it 's charlotte . 
i do n't want to go home . 
i could cut the ones that are left for you . 
what do you feel like singing bob ? 
charlie this is bob . bob  charlie brown . 
you really are having a mid - life crisis . 
see you later . 
oh good . do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here ? 
not really . how long are you here for ? 
yeah . did you get some sleep ? 
oh hi . 
hi again how 's it going ? 
thanks . i 'm sure your mid - life crisis will work outtoo . 
i do n't know but i can think about it a lot . 
i 'm not sure yet ... i graduated last spring . 
25 years ... that 's a long time ... are you still in love with your wife ? 
you 're probably just having a mid- life crisis . did you buy a porche ? 
two years . 
my husband 's here for work - he 's a photographer- and i just came along ... i'm not really doing anything right now and we have some friends who live here . 
what are you doing here ? 
i miss you . 
yeah i know you have to work the whole time i 'll probably have more fun here . i 'll call charlie and those guys . 
are you sure you have to go ? 
mmm i love cristal let 's have some . 
i 'm not . it 's just corny but i 'm not into it . 
oh ... that 's nothing someone gave it to me . 
ok i will ... later . 
but i like to ... and i do n't smoke that much . 
do you think it 's done ? 
hair stuff ? 
like popcorn ? 
you smell weird . 
i do n't know what to do . 
i went to a temple today and i did n't feel anything . 
ok . maybe i 'll walk down with you . 
how 'd it go today ? 
no i thought it was funny . forget it . 
why do you have to defend her ?

why do n't you just stay there and you can have it everyday . 
is there anything i can do ? 
what are you talking about ? 
it 's just carpet . 
it 's really hard to reach you ... did you get the carpet samples ? i like the burgundy . 
is this a bad time ? 
good - night . 
ok well ... i love you . 
well that 's good i have to get the kids off for school .   can i call you in a little while ? 
that sounds great  can you hold on ...   what zoe ? 
oh yeah ? i wish i had seen it . 
hello darling . 
we 're still going to be together . 
listen to me i love you peter i 'm trying to protect you ! 
she 's been stalking you peter . 
honey you 're exhausted .   do you want to lie down for a little while ? 
must be a spare set . 
i do n't know .   what are they ? 
this is the person ... you were talking about ? 
there you are !   my god darling i 've been so worried .   are you alright ? 
you need to believe in something besides yourself . 
well it shattered your faith in everything . 
like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic . 
no of course not but i think now that this has happened a lot of things can start to come out ... 
i do n't know .   in a way i 'm glad it all happened . 
thank god he did . 
i 'm still shaking . 
when did they find her ? 
what ?   that 's horrible ! 
i spaced out . 
hey what are you doing here in the middle of the day ? 
oh peter you 're going to pursue this . 
now that you 're on tv you 're a magnet for all the wackos out there . 
did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings ? 
peter where are you ? 
you know there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we 're losing daylight .   quarks and dark matter things like that .   even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast you know ? 
i ca n't believe it 's already starting to get dark so early . 
i must really be slacking off .   hungry ? 
you never said anything to me ... 
it 's great of you to let william and susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet . 
how 'd your interview go ?   i 'm sure you charmed the hell out of sally . 
i missed you . 
eight .   that okay ? 
you know i made a reservation at marco 's for peter 's birthday dinner but maybe you should cater it . 
... you wearing a watch father ? 
frustrating .   form over content . everything 's so retro . 
peter are you okay ? 
you heard voices you know you did . 
and was he in distress when you opened the door ?   or was he sitting here relaxed at this table ? 
what did you hear ? 
dr. allen could you please tell mr. kelson what you heard as you tried to enter mr. birdson 's room ? 
you 'll do it ? 
father i have nowhere else to stay . 
i hope so . 
he will .   he has great faith . 
if you really believe in god why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real ? 
you were n't there .   give me time to get some proof . 
father please do n't die . 
so i guess satan lost .   satan is the weak one . 
so if christ won that means what does that mean father ?   that satan ... 
we won because christ ... triumphed over satan ? 
so ... we won ? 
father !   thank god you 're better !   i really need your help .   we 've only got a few more hours . 
father i 'm right here . 
-- you would n't last five minutes . 
why are you doing this to me ? 
oh thank you thank you so much ! 
i did n't know what else to do ... 
peter ... peter kelson . 
well i know he 's come here before . 
i took one of those home pregnancy tests but i do n't want to tell him . i 'm rh negative .   my blood type is negative ...   if he 's rh positive i 'll have to terminate . 
hi i 'd like to make an appointment for peter kelson . 
oh peter . 
not a lot . 
he was trying to tell me something . 
he 's been repeating that since birdson 's exorcism .   i looked in every passage in the bible and there 's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything . 
i 'll be all right .   peter at the very end i think father was back .   i saw it in his eyes . 
you have to be experienced to do this . just wait outside . otherwise you risk killing him . 
maybe i should check lareaux 's book . it 's in the car .   be right back .   do n't go anywhere . 
what are these ? 
only your body will remain .   i believe your soul will be at peace .   if we kill you satan ca n't stay . 
until it happens you 're still a human being . 
maybe that 's my problem . 
i know it is .   right after my parents died i went to the beach ...   i was in the water .   everything was calm .   and then one of those really big waves hit me .   hard .   pulled me straight to the bottom .   i struggled and finally ran out of air .   if it had n't been for my sister who pulled me out i would 've drowned . legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me . 
i was desperate .   i knew you wrote about murders .   i needed a way in . 
you have to say that . 
i 'm scared i 'm slipping back . 
i see things .   my worst fears .   you need to know something peter .   i was possessed once .   like birdson .   it took father lareaux six days to pull me out of it . 
sometimes when i feel weak i have these ... visions . 
there 's nothing else here . 
he could n't stop us and that 's how he was punished .   peter what time were you born ? 
it 'll happen at the exact time of your birth . 
your 33rd birthday .   the transformation will be a perversion of christ 's rising from the dead .   townsend discovered it in one of lareaux 's books . 
when 's your birthday ? 
peter let go of the chair ! 
get up ! ! 
nothing yet . 
we needed to know all we could . 
the books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out . 
townsend he had some of father 's books . 
i do n't know .   i do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way .   i do n't know if it works the same way in this instance .   i do n't even know when it 's going to happen . 
peter i believe your baptism was perverted .   look at your certificate . your mother was the only witness to it . your blood - type does n't match who you thought your father was .   peter ... i'm sorry . 
then why are you here ? 
peter your blood - type is ab negative . there 's no way your birth father can be o positive .   you father is not who you think he is . 
do you know your parents ' blood types ? 
seven years .   one baptism ?   he 's your mother 's only brother 
the only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at bedford . 
you were not baptized .   at least i do n't believe it was christian .   your baptism was performed by your uncle james mckenzie . 
there 's no reason why you should .   this has been planned from your birth . you fit all the criteria that we know of .   never baptized born of incest devoid of faith ... 
you 're about to become the anti - christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world . 
i know this sounds crazy .   i understand . check your parents ' blood types .   are you sure your parents are your birth parents ? 
you 're already contaminated .   it 's why you could n't hear the tape .   there 's probably a pentacle near your bed .   to sanctify you . 
the good outwitting the bad .   it 's like birdson had a split personality . 
if you 're possessed you ca n't reveal anything satan wants hidden .   unless you trick him . 
it 's true .   birdson knew your name he was writing it in numerical code .   it was n't easy but i figured it out .   it spelled your name . 
at the exorcism birdson boasted that satan is about to take over the body of a man .   you are that man peter . 
townsend believed just as god became man in christ .   so satan will assume human form .   i believe it too . 
please the children . 
peter please ... 
that 's their explanation .   you might not believe me ... 
i had to . 
you 're right .   i must 've made a mistake . 
you 're sure ?   there was nothing ? 
what do you mean ? 
so ... what did you think of the tape . 
well i think it 's very simple .   here 's a tape of birdson 's exorcism .   i 'll be at the public library .   tomorrow at 2 ... if you want to meet him . 
on television you seemed so sure of yourself .   if you 're really that confident you 'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong ? 
an exorcism was just held for birdson . it failed .   disastrously .   which means there 's still a demonic spirit present in his body .   i was wondering perhaps you 'd like to go meet henry .   he 's pretty amazing . 
last week the catholic church certified him as genuinely possessed .   you realize how rarely they make that ruling ? 
do you remember henry birdson ?   the math professor who won the salwen medal then went home and killed his family ? 
in the end the jury saw it my way . 
i murdered my parents mr. kelson .   and while they deserved it i still went to confession the following sunday . 
and i also believe in god and the devil . in fact i know they exist . 
what if i told you i was a malignant narcissist ? 
and also that ... 
you said that malignant narcissism was not evil . 
i saw you on television yesterday .   you were brilliant . 
peter kelson ? 
oh my god ! 
look john i 'm facing it . 
you ca n't back out on me now .   we need to be sure . 
we 'll see father frank in the morning . there 's nothing to be done until then . 
we need all the help we can get . 
i 've filed a report with father frank . 
i 'll explain everything later .   can you meet me tonight ? 
i know who he is . 
good seeing you again . 
when i said quincy could do better i was thinking about you . 
you had your coaches and your father for that stuff .   it never mattered one way or the other if i went to your games . 
that 's ridiculous . 
i do n't remember that . 
do n't tell me you are n't ashamed of that because i know . 
oh yes .   the superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife . 
so you 're angry with me because you 're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume ? 
what was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things i knew could help you ? 
child please .   ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything i had to say . 
you 're the one always turning your nose up at me . 
do n't curse . 
you did n't want my opinion in the first place so why even ask ? 
find out where they 're registered and send them a gift . 
his mother had a cookout a few weeks ago . he could do a lot better if you ask me . 
to that stewardess ? 
how is he ? 
i can manage . 
whenever you lose you get this attitude . but it 's just a game . 
he 's still at the bank . 
do n't be defensive .   i 'm just surprised to see you . 
monica .   what are you doing here ? 
tonight do n't worry about yesterday 's game the recruiters or anything else . i just want you to enjoy being beautiful . will you do that ? 
nothing .   so good luck . 
sure .   in between all the other things i have to do . 
child take a bite . 
taste this . 
watch your mouth . 
that 's not funny 
i do n't know why i keep hoping you 'll grow out of this tomboy thing . 
fine you do n't like this one which one would you rather wear ? 
i 'm lucky i found it .   someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage . 
oh all that work . 
monica what did you do ? 
the blue . 
how is she alright looking the way she does ? 
she needs to stop running around like a little boy . 
you might want to put a jacket on him it 's getting cold . 
so you 're still breast - feeding ? 
so that means it 's alright for you to act like that ? 
... and if you want a thicker base you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour . 
i just need to lay down .   i 've been running around all day . 
when you 're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth ? 
really ?   well come on then . 
well no but once nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older it 's definitely something i want to do .   since you love to cook maybe it 's something we can talk about . 
oh me too .   i used to cook for my friends ' parties and things back in atlanta . 
well thanks again .   this was really nice of you . 
until the black family down the street became the black family next door . 
what are you talking about ? 
it mattered mom . 
that 's all you cared about .   i must have played in a thousand games and i can only remember you being to two . 
what 's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman 's home cooking and ironing his drawers . 
i do .   you never stood up for yourself . ever .   if i was ashamed it was because of that . 
i remember when i was eight years old you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal .   all you 'd let me and lena do was set the table .   and i guess you and dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas .   and you did n't say anything . you just threw the whole meal into some tupper - ware and tossed it in the fridge . 
that 's not it . 
i 'm angry because i want a mother not martha stewart . 
because you 're pushing me to be something i 'm not . 
i was n't lena .   i did n't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume . 
no i do n't . 
there you go . 
i asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy . 
so what do i do ? 
maybe she is . 
yeah you met her ? 
yeah .   ca n't wait to see him   i just saw quincy . 
need any help ? 
dad around ? 
did n't know i needed a reason to come home . 
you really should be a caterer or something like you used to say . 
i ca n't eat before a game . 
well that 's what you think is n't it ? cause i 'd rather wear a jersey than an apron ... 
i wo n't .   i 'm a lesbian . 
i hate it . 
ah mom . 
it 's just ... it seems like you 're always yelling at me . 
i thought sidra 's ankle was okay for next game . 
i can take it . 
uh - huh . 
my mouth is kinda dry . 
sort of . 
oh sorry .

i was just playing ball . 
thanks sidra . 
what 's up with that ? 
coach hates me does n't she ? 
if i lose i 'll buy you a wedding present . 
so if i win it 's because deep down you know you 're about to make the biggest mistake of your life and deep down your want me to stop you . 
you once said the reason i beat you was because you wanted me to . 
i know why you broke up with me in college .   and not that what you did was n't messed up but what i did was too .   so if you forgive me i 'll forgive you .

your heart . 
one game .   one - on - one . 
i 'll play you . 
better late than never right ? 
then why are you so upset ? 
i know i probably should have said it two weeks ago . 
what i 'm trying to say is i 've loved you since i was eleven and the shit wo n't go away . 
it 's not fun for me anymore because you 're missing . 
from basketball . 
you asked me what was missing . 
we need to talk . 
it does n't matter alright .   just leave it alone . 
something was just missing . 
why do you keep asking me that ? 
it 's a trip you know ?   when you 're a kid you see the life you want and it never crosses your mind that it 's not gon na turn out that way . 
like what ? 
you 're serious . 
and you tore up your knee .   rehab is tough . 
you had a rough couple years that 's all . 
it just is n't . 
that 's okay .   i 'm probably you know busy . 
strong enough to get you down the aisle ? 
so ... how 's the knee ? 
who 's this guy i always see her around ? 
you visiting ? 
yeah and quincy good luck with your knee and everything . 
yeah .   basketball just is n't fun anymore .   you know ?

should n't you be lying down or ... 
no it looks good .   i mean it 's cool . 
i was .   i see your peach fuzz finally grew in . 
uh huh . 
so that 's it just forget about us ? 
when did you decide all this ? 
you 're what ? 
you do n't think so ? 
how are you going to tell me what i have time for ?   i mean whatever i did ... we can fix this . 
how do i know next time you 're feeling neglected or whatever you 're not going to run around on me ?   if we 're going to be together i have to be able to trust you . 
i 'm a ballplayer .   if anyone knows what that means it should be you . 
i never asked you to choose . 
if i stayed i would n't be starting ! 
that night you wanted to talk about your dad i had a curfew .   what was i supposed to do ?

what are we playing for ? 
that was so weak . 
i do n't have it easy like you alright . there 's no red carpet laid out for me . 
i 'm telling you coach wishes she was here instead of me . 
i said fine . 
fine quincy .

happy .   and he wo n't want to see you . 
he tore his acl . 
the doctor'll be back in a minute . 
not great . 
fine then how many nights home is that ? 
you said you 'd think about going back to get your degree . 
i 'm just saying it 'd be nice if you found time for your family . you should see the tramps coming after quincy .   if you do n't talk to him ... 
i came second to the nba .   i 'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job . 
at one in the morning ? 
you just got back from a four game road trip .

we should head over . 
guess i should have been telling your father .

just ... leave it alone . 
whose truth are you talking about ?

i 'm fine . 
you scared me . 
later when ?

how was your game ? 
you hearing me ? 
i 'm not playing with you these girls are looking to get you caught .   they see you they see dollar signs . 
quincy i told you about these fat - ass girls . 
i look like some hoochie to you ?   i found it on your floor . 
what is this ? 
sometimes .   but what 's the alternative not playing ?   you remember big toni ?   she quit last year now she 's working at some bookstore .   i mean look at us . they treat us like we 're hollywood stars over here .   we just played in the championship game .   it does n't get much sweeter than this . 
shoot italian boys love them some black women .   they ca n't get enough of me . 
what ?   you 've been over here seven months and you ai n't tapped anything ? 
so what are these spanish guys like ? 
yup .   so i 've been playing with this italian club the last three years . 
yeah four years ago .   they had me staying in this tiny - ass town with like fifty people .   i 'm not playing there was about a thousand goats running around and it gets dark at four o'clock .   then the whack club i 'm on loses three games in a row and i get blamed .   so they fire me . 
can you take that damn thing off the table . 
i 'm gon na love winning this championship in your house . 
well what do you know . 
never let a freshman take your spot . 
just one word of advice for next season . 
but that was a dumb - ass pass to toni . ten seconds left you run out the clock . 
no buts .   took a lot of heart to take that charge . 
just wanted to say good game . 
you were trying to make me look bad . 
that 's what you get for trying to show out freshman . 
besides .   i 've been starting point the last two years .   ai n't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot . 
hey do n't take it personal .   and do n't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other .   we 're teammates okay ? 
she hates all freshmen .

do you remember what you said ? 
you remember when we first met ?   and were together alone in that room . and the exhilaration was too much to hold on to . and then something flickered across your face like a shadow and i asked you what was wrong ? 
he did n't know you had been in a mental institution . be asked me if i knew . i said yes . i wanted to talk to him . he said he wanted to bring it up to you . face to face . 
you did n't do it to me will ; it 's happened to us .   and if i survive the wallpaper we 'll be okay ...   he 's after you now is n't he ?

you mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma .   you are open and easy now ... it took you a lot of work to get to that ... 
i said you are fine he should leave you the hell alone . 
he asked how you are . 
he stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here . 
it 's dragon . dragon ... red dragon .

that was nice of you to think of that . 
ready to tell me what kind of ' outing ' this is ? 
i 'll probably go back to it someday . 
you know you speak very well although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech . at the riker institute for the blind . i trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children ... 
they had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract . 
in the kitchen . 
come on in .   how about a gin and tonic ? 
thanks but i 'll take the bus . i do it all the time . 
no thanks . i manage very well .   i 'll order you twelve hundred feet : of 1000 c tomorrow . 
the 1000 c infrared sensitive film must be handled in total darkness . i keep the samples straight by touch code .   it 's still easier to handle than a 1200 series . think it 'll do ? 
let me stick this in the black hole . 
when do you need it ? 
what 's being photographed ? 
can you give me an idea of the conditions ... 
put your back against the door . come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left . 
you 're not dying ! 
how can you be so casual ? ? ! 
have you told your family ? 
jesus andy !   can they cure it ? 
andy ... there is no real you . 
andy you 're not horrible .   you 're just ... complicated . 
i brought you haagen dazs . chocolate . 
it 's me . 
then stop treating me like a fucking prop . 
is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble ? ? 
no !   you get in the kitchen .   i 'm gon na make you dry my dishes ! 
and all this will be for real ? 
why memphis ? 
do i wanna go to memphis and get married ? 
i 'm here ai n't i ? 
you were impressed with something . it 's pretty odd when a man sports a hard - on that large on national television . 
why did you call me ?   the last person i ever expected to get a call from was you . 
andy the theater 's that way ! 
no thanks . 
hi ... am i late ? 
why did you call me ?   the last person i ever expected to get a call from was you . 
andy the theater 's that way ! 
no thanks . 
hi ... am i late ? 
oh .   so you were just pretending to be an asshole . 
buzz off .   go patronize somebody else . 
... yes . 
goddamn you cypher ! 
but you 're out cypher .   you ca n't go back . 
the matrix is n't real ! 
my god .   morpheus .   you gave them morpheus . 
you killed them . 
an accident ? ! 
cypher ?   where 's tank ? 
morpheus will take him when he 's ready . 
do n't tell me you 're a believer now ? 
are you sure this line is clean ? 
did you hear that ? 
if you have something to say i suggest you say it to morpheus . 
i ... it does n't matter what i believe . 
morpheus believes he is the one . 
do n't be ridiculous . 
i know but i felt like taking a shift . 
you ca n't use that until neo is out ! 
how long ? 
what is he doing ? 
they 'll be able to track it . 
what if he is n't the one morpheus ? how can you be so sure ? 
i got a fibrillation ! 
all right -- 
are they any agent ? 
not yet . 
are you all right ? 
you moved like they moved .   i 've never seen anyone move that fast . 
neo how did you do that ? 
no one has ever done anything like this . 
no ?   let me tell you what i believe . i believe morpheus means more to me than he does to you .   i believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since i am the ranking officer on this ship if you do n't like it then i believe that you can go to hell because you are n't going anywhere else . 
i 'm coming with you . 
no neo .   that 's not true .   it ca n't be true . 
no you ... have to be . 
morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out !   there 's no way you 're going back in ! 
you ca n't ! 
what are you doing ? 
what choice ? 
goddamnit !   goddamnit ! 
what happened ? 
is morpheus still alive tank ? 
we have to ! 
a deju vu is usually a glitch in the matrix .   it happens when they change something . 
how much like it ?   was it the same cat ? 
what happened ?   what did you see ? 
what did you just say ? 
are you all right ? 
she told me ... 
are you worried ? 
that 's different . 
that the matrix can not tell you who you are . 
it disables any electrical system in the blast radius .   it 's the only weapon we have against the machines . 
easy neo .   easy . 
it 's going into replication . 
we think you 're bugged .   try to relax . 
and i know that 's not where you want to be . 
because you 've been down there neo . you already know that road .   you know exactly where it ends . 
neo please you have to trust me . 
from you . 
it 's necessary neo .   for our protection . 
when i asked him he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question .   they have to see it to believe it . 
it 's the question that brought you here .   you know the question just as i did .   it is a hacker 's question . 
please .   just listen .   i know why you 're here neo .   i know why you left your family and your friends why you left your home to come to this city .   you 're looking for him . 
they 're watching you neo . 
right now all i can tell you is that you are in danger .   i brought you here to warn you . 
no .   it 's safe here and i do n't have much time . 
most guys do . 
that was a long time ago . 
my name is trinity . 
i know a lot about you .   i 've been wanting to meet you for some time . 
hello neo . 
hurry neo . 
what just happened ? 
an agent !   you have to send me back ! 
tank i need a pilot program for a military m-109 helicopter . 
you 're going to kill him ?   kill morpheus ? ! 
tank you 're hurt . 
got it . 
cypher i thought -- 
we need an exit ! 
he 's alive . 
tank it 's me . 
you 're going to have to make a final choice .   in one hand you will have morpheus ' life .   in the other hand you will have your own .   one of you is going to die .   which one will be up to you . 
morpheus believes in you neo and no one not you or even me can convince him otherwise .   he believes it so blindly that he 's going to sacrifice his life to save yours . 
i know .   poor morpheus .   without him we are lost .   we will never find the one . 
what 's funny ? 
your next life maybe .   who knows . that 's how these things go . 
sorry kid .   you got the gift but looks like you 're waiting for something . 
but you already know what i 'm going to tell you . 
okay now i 'm supposed to say ' hmmm that 's interesting but ... ' then you say -- 
so ?   what do you think ?   you think you 're the one ? 
not too bright though . 
you 're cuter than i thought .   i see why she likes you . 
i said do n't worry about it .   i 'll get one of my kids to fix it . 
that vase . 
i 'd ask you to sit down but you 're not going to anyway .   and do n't worry about the vase . 
bingo .   not quite what you were expecting right ?   i got to say i love seeing you non - believers . always a pip .   almost done .   smell good do n't they ? 
i know .   you 're neo .   be right with you . 
for god 's sakes ... i told you before ... nothing .   charlie i ca n't stay in here too long at this hour ... will you please listen to me ? 
charlie ... i've got to see you .   i want to talk ... 
the building on the corner .   that one !   he 's been on the roof a half hour now ! 
the green capsules in the top drawer . 
i 'm sleepy . 
i can take care of myself .   you know that . 
you know why ... with my parents . 
i 'm going to take that apartment uptown . 
you 're intolerable today . 
sure ... he lives there ? 
i know you do n't .   you 've been very preoccupied lately . 
it was nothing .   i 'm almost finished . 
a paper on that one too ? 
c'm on charlie ... one more day .   i 'll call in sick for work . 
it 's still sick . 
it does n't make any sense .   he would n't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy ... not unless it was personal . 
alright ... hey did you hear any more about what happened last night ? 
what is it now ? 
anything specific ? 
charlie ... ? 
an apartment uptown ?   downtown ? 
it 's all right . 
i do n't mind . 
please take it . 
do you have enough ? 
i 'd like to eat something before i go back to work . 
have n't you had enough of us dad ? 
look who 's talking . 
you think so ? 
nothing 's going on .   maybe he does n't want to be alone .   he 's go- ing to be sixty - five in a minute -- 
that 's your name ? 
... i 'm here are n't i ?   would n't miss a loose end meeting .   what 's on the table for discussion ?   party favors flowers -- hi dad hi drew -- 
hi everybody .   sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief -- 
drew called from the astar they 're still two minutes away . 
that 's it .   it 's over .   get out . 
well ... goodnight . 
sorry but i like the way he looks and talks to me .   and vice versa . okay ? 
drew you 're out of line . 
you do n't mean that .   you would n't disappoint daddy -- 
... see you tomorrow night . 
what ' business ' ? 
you think so ? 
that 's it ? 
-- yes ? 
hold me -- 
tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now -- 
but you 're not .   you 're somewhere else .   you 're someone else -- 
you want me to wait for you you 'll be back -- 
-- that was the place ... and you were the guy . 
and i said you 'd have a hard time finding a woman like that . 
yes that 's why i said it . 
it 's a saying . 
' love will find out the way ' . 
lightning struck .   we caught it in a bottle .   do n't let it out .   i want to be with you joe -- 
do n't .   that will come later . 
we know all that we need to know -- 
then do n't . 
it gets worse . 
and you ca n't tell me who you are . 
where are you going ? 
it beats a surgical does n't it ? 
i like you in a black tie . 
for how long ? 
where are you going ? 
more than you love peanut butter ? 
did you like making love to me ? 
maybe it 's the draft through the door . 
he must be tired -- this bontecou thing -- 
i just thought i 'd drop by scrounge a little lunch i was in the neigh- borhood -- 
you 're here ? 
and is your heart beating strangely ? 
i do n't know who you are . 
never tried ' til now .   joe may i kiss you ? 
it was everything . 
-- i guess you have n't . 
i 'm sorry about -- 
i said get out . 
why do n't you get off his case ? 
' to bed ' ? 
where are you going ? 
because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married . 
how long have you been standing there ? 
we 're doing what we can for her . but it does n't look good . 
i am too . 
it comforts you does n't it ? 
i adore things like that .... food i ca n't do without .   do n't you ? 
why do you love peanut butter so much ? 
and i appreciate you too . 
excuse me ? 
it was n't an intrusion .   and if it was it turned out to be welcome . 
i thought you said ' be sorry for nothing ' . 
i have to go i 'm sorry to say -- 
joe i 'm with drew . 
patients have visitors not doctors . 
that 's impossible .   i 'm a doctor i 'm -- 
watch me do what ? 
i do n't have any time to see you now .   i 'm doing grand rounds and then i 'm examining back - to - back patients until dinner and then -- 
then why are you here joe ? 
i think you want to go to the west wing .   through there . 
goodnight joe . 
i 'm sorry to say i know what you 're saying . 
yes -- ? 
i can see why . 
i 've got plenty of friends . 
no joe i 'm swimming here .   then i 'm going home . 
drew is none of your damn business . nor is where i put my mouth . 
come again ? 
-- what kind of childhood did you have ? 
you act like you never had peanut butter before -- 
what are your intentions ?   to make little dreams in coffee shops turn a woman 's head and i do n't mind admitting it was turned i liked it but ten hours later i feel like a fool .   i do n't get it .   you my father here in this house the cof- fee shop it 's making me upset and i do n't like being upset .   who are you anyway ?   and what are you eating ? 
not the one i met this morning hit- ting on me in as nice a way as i 've been hit on in a long time but the moment you find out i 'm my dad 's daughter you act like a stranger . 
you appear at his side out - of - the- blue stay at his house eat dinner with his family it 's practically a first .   you 're in the red - hot center of big business and i thought you were a regular joe . 
-- ca n't seem to escape you today . 
what are you doing here ? 
the fireworks are about to start . 
oh dad you 're not old .   you 'll never be old . 
oh yes -- 
i love you daddy -- 
but what ? 
are you relieved ? 
you were right about joe he is going somewhere -- 
what a night . 
i love him . 
c'm on !   the guy 's working with you . you always know chapter and verse about everyone who works -- 
where 's he going ? 
what are you afraid of dad ?   that i 'll fall head over heels for joe -- well i have -- as you did with mom .   that 's always been standard whether you like or not . 
why ?   a man appears at your side almost never leaves it you clearly trust him depend on him i sense you value him deeply why are n't those things good enough for me ? 
love .   passion .   obsession all those things you told me to wait for .   well they 've arrived . 
because i was sitting in a staff meeting incredibly bored my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- joe . 
where is he ? 
where 's joe ? 
it 's something . 
when you say ' nothing ' that way it 's not nothing . 
now we love drew and joe in verbo- ten ?   what 's going on ? 
then what will you say ? 
raise away . 
yeah it 's good to get together . 
it 'll come back daddy . 
funny i do n't get that feeling . maybe it 's because you found out i 'm bill parrish 's daughter . 
incidentally ' joe ' what ? 
-- this morning .   the corinth coffee shop .   he was looking for a doctor . 
we 've met . 
well go get 'em pops .

no it was so right it scares me . 
i 've got to go -- 
you 'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days -- 
you 'd give up what you want for the woman you marry ? 
' pro bono ' .   that means doing good -- going to be doing good all your life ?

leonard you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me .

would you ?   because if you could n't i would be very lonely ... i would have left the only world i know and have known since i was seventeen .   but none of this will happen .   so it does n't matter .   because we are on the guajira peninsula .   and all you see around you ... look around ... is archangel de jesus montoya- londono .   he is my man .   and you are a smuggler moving a load ... 
and if i were in the comoros in the indian ocean where would you be ... ? 
is this the protective male talk ?

'cause whatever can go wrong will ... ?

i forgot the napkins . 
hola viejo . 
maybe i 'm only one . 
what if i pushed to twenty - one ... ? 
available cash is not an issue for us ...

to mothers .   and all that we owe them ... 
blanca ... a rubio like you .   i see her in a dress ... an old photograph from lucinda somebody 's wedding ... everybody is with couples .   husbands and wives .   they all pose .   my mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting .   ... she looks right into the camera . she is the most beautiful woman in the room .   by herself .   in a party dress .   and she looked like she knew she would die alone ...   she spoke many languages .   we were in luanda when she died .   i went to her friends in mali .   they sent me to the ecole polytechnique in geneva to study mathematics where i met montoya in the discos .   he had banking there ... i was seventeen and very much into the clubs .   and he sent me to university for an mba in finance .   your mother ? 
i insist . 
tell < u > me</u > everything . 
later !   do you dance ? 
i am no one 's wife .   i live in my own house .   i do not live in a man 's house .   he has a wife .   we are together .   i am free .   because of banking and finance and travel ...   and i can do anything i want ... 
angolan military .   went back to the fighting .   disappeared .   who knows ... ? 
she 's dead ... 
angola .   my mother was being a surgeon there .   she volunteered . mozambique and mali too ...   ... those days in those days ... she was part of cuba 's gift to the third world .   she came from a bourgeois family with a house in verdado ... we still have the house . we will go there ... 
i never do business in cuba .   and nobody goes to cuba but me .   and he is not my husband ... 
my cousin is the harbor master . you must not bring in drugs .   you can not be armed .   if you 're carrying it has to go .   or stow it inside .   no one will go near your boat ... 
are you afraid ?   good .   and you do n't need a visa . cause you 're with me . 
off a little alley with cobblestones .   hemingway went there ... 
bodeguita del medio .   it 's the < u > only</u > place for mojitas ... 
show me ... ? 
how fast does that go ? 
what do you like to drink ? 
and what is that ? 
what 's the recovery ?   how much are you looking for ? 
we want it back . 
right now . 
you do . 
put your guns on the table ...   if we wanted you dead you would no longer be drawing breath in miami . we would n't have brought you all the way here . 
i like the diminished risk .   it frees up capital reserves .   i like working with self - interested businessmen who are competent .   you can predict their behavior .... 
i think josé suspects anybody he does n't intimidate .   and people who are good at what they do ?   they have egos too ... 
a good deal like this with us for burnett will be good only temporarily .   he 'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever .   life is dust make it while you can .   he 's ambitious . 
they 're serious .   they 're cautious . they 'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery 's handled ... they'd walk away rather than compromise operational security ... that 's good . 
burnett ?   they want 22 % of the value on loads they run into south florida .   it 's the juarez cartel model . they guarantee the loads .   the upside is our risk goes to zero . that frees - up capital . 
they 've been targeted .   and pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now . 
transshipped to a malaysian container ship . 
... and we 're looking at nigerian crude ... 
they will kill you .   and then they will kill your wife too . 
it 's all bullshit .   jesus is out of communication in fals de iguazu . josé knows that ...   whatever he 's going to do he has to do it fast because he 's acting on his own . and he will need a story . 
of course !   that is why i placed myself here with you knowing yero would pull this crap . 
that sonofabitch ! 
maritime .   jose will fill you in . 
two three thousand a ki . two thousand ki 's your end is $ 6000000 .   complex transshipments or dealing with containers these have front- loaded costs we pickup .   for this kind of weight the balance of 80 % is when our buyer picks up the load .   transactions are offshore .   dollars or euros .   secure internet transfers .   we have lists of cayman and isle of man banks infiltrated by irs to be avoided ...   no transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on u.s. soil ...   that 's the deal . 
i run down the numbers .   nothing is very negotiable .   small loads ?   we pay three thousand a ki . we pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent .   the next ten percent on u.s. landfall . 
did you hear me ?   get dr. raymond ! now ! ! 
okay jeremy ... go get dr. chris raymond will you ? 
what 's your name ? 
we 're no leaving you ! 
which way ? 
peter you could n't even fix our tv ! 
but the power ... 
scent glands .   insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other . 
we 'll find him . we 'll be back and find him . 
this is our baby peter . yours and mine . are n't you proud ? 
mantids can mimic . we gave the judas that code ... 
just inner chambers ... 
your arm you ca n't ... 
oh come on come on ! 
that 's it . that 's it . breathe easy . 
do n't touch it .   and for godsakes try not to sweat .   they can sense chemical changes ... 
the scent wo n't last ... 
just do it ! ! 
rub it on the windows ! 
they do n't know anything peter they just sense . they 're hardwired ! 
his blood ! it 's driving them crazy ! we have to mask the odor ! 
that 's camouflage ... 
no jesus no . 
do n't . 
it 's me . can you hear me ? 
it did n't bite me . 
why take the chance ?   just let me go down there with you ... 
... you do n't even know what you 're looking for . 
ironic do n't you think ?   these guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs right ? and here we are ... 
i was just late . 
i get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids . 
no such thing baby . 
he was just doing his job . 
i heard how you talked to him . 
no there 's ... 
metaxonycha godmani . 
even if they did ... that 's all we have is n't it ? 
keep going . we 'll tell you when to stop ... 
evolution does n't work that fast . something pushed that thing to take the leap . we need to find another specimen . 
do n't you get it ? it 's more than that . 
this thing was the size of my fist peter ! ! that 's off the charts ! 
i needed to think . it was either this or the weather channel . 
i 'll be late . 
you were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear do n't forget that . 
monks bottle their own wine . do n't they ? 
we did no impact evaluation .   the consequences of ... 
you know what i mean ... 
do you think we did the right thing ? 
you sure you did n't see one of these ? 
you guys have done a nice job .   how bout five dollars ? 
i know .   help me get a sample . 
my god . 
and they 're not fully developed .   this thing 's not even an adult . 
this wing configuration . i 've never ... 
it bit you . 
i have no idea .   are you ready ? 
i 'm gon na pull it out and i want you to pin it down okay ? 
what 's this ? 
oh jesus . 
watch your step siri .   your grant could be on the line here . 
... as long as they 're ready for the opening i do n't care just tell them that . 
siri sandblast that thing . it looks like trump tower .   those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions ... 
i 'd be delighted . now that you know the way ... 
but you did n't even taste your cocoa . 
i always say if you ca n't enjoy your own company you 're not fit company for anyone else . 
how does a nice cup of cocoa sound ? 
well i just thought -- oh look at me . you 'd think i 'd never had a house guest before . would you like something to drink ? 
i could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine and you could tell me what you think . 
it 's right this way . 
god told me since i was his number- one fan that i should make up new stories as if i was paul sheldon . so went to town . and i bought a typewriter . and paper to type on . the same kind paul sheldon used . and i turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio . would you like to see it ? 
i know . it 's so upsetting . i 'm his number - one fan ... i've got all his books every sentence he ever put down . i 'm so proud of my paul sheldon collection ...   ... here i am prattling on and my manners have just flown away . i have n't invited you in . please . 
what do you want to know ? 
guess you can tell from my reaction i 'm not all that used to visitors out here . what can i do for you ? 
oh my ! 
did i do good ? 
ahh ! ! ! 
oh paul this is so romantic . ian and windthorne dueling for the right to misery 's hand . does ian win ? oh do n't me . it 's windthorne right ? 
yes paul . 
i was fooling silly .   you need a cigarette because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book and you just have one and the match is to light it . and you need one glass of champagne .   dome pear - igg - non . 
what things ? 
oh paul . i 'm dying . does she wind up with ian or windthorne ? you have to tell me . 
paul this will be our legacy . 
it was windthorne . i knew it -- what does that do to her love for ian?--   --of course if she had n't thought windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with ian in the first place .   sorry it 's just that this is so wonderful . 
this is so exciting . it 's windthorne her first love right ? 
the stranger staying at the inn is he someone from misery 's past ? 
oh paul . it 's beautiful . 
but the time is now . soon others will come . 
that 's disgusting . 
i 'll drive a sledgehammer into your man - gland if you 're not nicer-- 
why are you so mean mister you'd - be- dead - in - the - snow - if - it - wasn't - for- me ? 
do n't talk to me like that . 
paul do n't you think it 's time for you to start writing again ? it 's been over a week . 
now do n't fuss paul . 
paul my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south . 
you 've been out of your room . 
paul i know you 've been out . 
that 's very kind of you but i 'll bet it 's not altogether true . 
the book is almost finished . your legs are getting better . soon you 'll be able to walk . you 'll be wanting to leave . 
when you first came here i only loved the writer part of paul sheldon . but now i know i love the rest of him too . as much as misery loves ian .   i know you do n't love me -- don't say you do -- you're a beautiful brilliant famous man of the world ; and i'm ... not a movie star type . you 'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you 're someone like me . 
the rain ... sometimes it gives me the blues . 
paul this is positively the best misery you 've ever written . 
oh god what have i done ? i 'm so sorry paul . i ruined your beautiful toast . will you ever forgive me ? here let me pour another one .   can we pretend this never happened ? to misery ? 
are you kidding ? if anyone ever told me that one day i 'd be having a candlelit dinner with paul sheldon in my own house i woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled . will this do ? 
you really think so ? 
oh you . i just picked things up over the years . 
oh i do n't know . i think so . i 'll go look . 
to misery . 
a toast ? 
my secret is i only use fresh tomatoes never canned . and to give it that little extra zip i mix in some spam with the ground beef . 
i hope you like it . 
oh paul . it would be an honor . 
i 'm going to play my records all day 
misery 's alive ! misery 's alive . oh it 's so romantic -- this whole house is going to be filled with romance . i 'm going to put on my liberace records--   --you do like liberace do n't you ? 
not even a hint ? 
will she still love him with that special perfect love ? 
i 've known from the very first book that misery had to be born of nobility and i was right ! 
you better . oh paul when ian realized that the reason they 'd buried misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma-- 
do n't be silly . of course you can . 
what 's the matter paul ? you have n't written a word . 
that 's right -- when i was growing up in bakersfield my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on saturday afternoons for the chapter plays ... 
paul what you 've written just is n't fair . 
paul it 's not worthy of you . throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me . you can leave that in . 
i 'm sorry paul . this is all wrong you 'll have to do it over again . 
do n't be silly . you 'll be brilliant . think of me as your inspiration . 
here in case you think of any ideas . 
it 'll only take a second . 
poor dear ... let 's get you back in bed and i 'll get them for you . 
paul you 're dripping with perspiration your color is very hectic -- what have you been doing ? 
are you sure ? 'cause if you want i 'll bring back the whole store for you . 
thank you for thinking of me .   anything else i can get while i 'm in town ? any other crucial requirements that need satisfying ? would you like a tiny tape recorder ? or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers ? 
well it does smudge after all -- isn't that fascinating ? 
but mine cost the most so i do n't see how it could smudge . 
you -- fooler ... !   did i do good ? 
do n't worry about that . you 'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work . 
i expect nothing less than your masterpiece . 
yes . it will be a book in my honor . for saving your life and nursing you back to health . i 'll be the first one to read it .   oh paul you 're going to make me the envy of the whole world ... 
i know you did n't mean it when you killed her and now you 'll make it right . 
oh but paul !   i do n't think i know ! now that you 've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript you can go back to doing what you 're great at--   --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- misery 's return . 
that 's the big surprise . your new studio -- after all writers do need a place to work . 
now do n't josh . this is a very big day for you paul . here . you just sit tight and i 'll set everything up . 
and look what i 've got for you . an electric razor so you can shave yourself now . 
see is n't this nice ? 
yeah well it 's a theory . here 's your novril .   how does tuna casserole sound for dinner ? 
i do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year . people say it has something to do with the ozone layer . what do you think ? 
as long as it does exist your mind wo n't ever be free . i think you should light the match paul . 
oh paul . this is n't about money . it 's about decency and purity . it 's about god 's values . 
i know this is the only copy paul . when you were twenty - four you wrote your first book and you did n't make a copy because you did n't think anybody would take it seriously . but they did . and ever since you 've never made any copies because you 're superstitious -- it 's why you always come back to the silver creek lodge . you told that story to merv griffin eleven years ago . 
so you 've indicated . do it . 
then light the match paul . 
i know this may be difficult for you but it 's for the best . 
i 'll get you everything you want but you must listen first . sometimes my thinking is a little muddy i accept that . it 's why i could n't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in denver . 
you 're such a kidder . i have a big surprise for you . but first there 's something you must do . 
what are you doing on the floor ?   it 's my fault . if i 'd had a proper hospital bed this never would have happened . here let me help you back in .   i know this hurts but it 'll only take a few seconds . there you go . comfy ? 
she slipped away ? she slipped away ? she did n't just slip away . you did it . you did it . you did it . you did it . you murdered my misery . 
then who did ? 
i don't want her spirit ! i want her ! and you murdered her ! 
you ... you dirty bird . she ca n't be dead . misery chastain can not be dead ! how could you ? 
of course i 'll like it . misery 's about to have her child . what 's it gon na be a boy or a girl ? ooh do n't tell me . 
i 'd love to stay here and chat but i 'm right at the end and i got ta find out what happens . 
it boils down to respect . people just do n't respect the institution of marriage any more . they have no sense of real commitment . 
do n't get me wrong . i 'm not against marriage per se . but it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again . 
no problem . 
i just kept reading them over and over . i know when i finish this one-- and i 've only got two chapters to go-- i 'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again . 
i do n't know about you but what i did to get through it was i dove into work -- days nights -- night shifts can be lonely at a hospital . i did a lot of reading . that was hen i first discovered misery . she made me so happy . she made me forget all my problems .   ' course i suppose you had a little something to do with that too . 
for a while i thought i might go crazy . 
yeah that and misery 's child -- those are the only two divine things ever in this world ... 
i 'm on page three - hundred now paul and it 's better than perfect -- it 's divine . what 's the ceiling that dago painted ? 
this farm was getting kind of dreary what with just the few cows and chickens and me--   but when i got misery here everything changed -- she just makes me smile so . 
yes . i told you i was your number- one fan . 
i thought it was time you two should meet . paul say hello to my favorite beast in all the world my sow misery . 
thank you so much . 
i knew it . i knew it was n't true . boy how do they get away with printing stuff like that ? 
i do n't mean to pry but i 've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials . and i said it ca n't be true . paul sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that . 
i made you my speciality -- scrambled eggs a la wilkes . and i 'm on page 75 . 
your agent said she would tell her you were okay . but i 'm afraid you 'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself . 
... it 's like a visit from my oldest dearest friend . 
well mine 's still out . but the ones in town were working just fine . i called that agent of yours .   oh paul i peeked at the very beginning .   what a wonderful first page -- just to read the name misery chastain ... 
the one to town is but that 's about it . i called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon . i told him who you were and what had happened . he said as long as there 's no infection you 're not in any danger and as soon as the road to the hospital is open they 'll send an ambulance for you . 
they had it at the store paul there was a whole batch of them there . as soon as i saw it i slammed my money down . i got the first copy . 
oh i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to wake you . 
it has no nobility . 
the swearing paul .   there i said it . 
well it 's brilliantly written but then everything you write is brilliant . 
oh it 's ridiculous who am i to make a criticism to someone like you ? 
oh like i could do that ? 
what 's it about ? 
what 's your new book called ? 
you 'll never realize what a rare treat you 've given me . 
if you would n't mind . 
it should n't be too much longer .   once the roads are open the lines'll be up in no time . if you give me their numbers i 'll keep trying them for you .   could i ask you a favor ?   i noticed in your case there was a new paul sheldon book and ...   and i wondered if maybe ... 
and you 're very brilliant and you must be a good man or you could never have created such a wondrous loving creature as misery chastain .   like a baby .   all done . 
lucky for you i did .   lucky for me too . because now you 're alive and you can write more books . oh paul i 've read everything of yours but the misery novels ... 
do n't move now -- wouldn't want to hurt this neck--   well the other afternoon i was on my way home and there you were leaving the lodge and i wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming . 
well it was n't any secret to me that you were staying at the silver creek seeing as how i 'm your number- one fan and all . some nights i 'd just tool on down there sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--   and i 'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world 's greatest writer . 
no it was n't a miracle at all ... in a way i was following you . 
of course you will . and your arm will be fine too . your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly but i finally popped it back in there .   but what i 'm most proud of is the work i did on those legs . considering what i had around the house i do n't think there 's a doctor who could have done any better . 
your legs just sing grand opera when you move do n't they ?   it 's not going to hurt forever paul i promise you . 
the   blizzard was too strong . i could n't risk trying to get you there . i tried calling but the phone lines are down . 
they 're called novril -- they're for your pain . 
you 've been here two days . you 're gon na be okay .   my name is annie wilkes and i'm-- 
shhh ... we 're just outside silver creek . 
it 's good you found it . 
what is it ? 
what thing ? 
oh i like that tone . 
that 's nice . 
what do you expect to find ? a story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm ? 
well whoever she is she sure likes to read a lot . 
it was an old car -- those dents could have been there forever . 
you do n't think he 's dead do you ? 
here 's the list of all sheldon 's credit charges . nothing after the silver creek .   any calls ? 
you really think sheldon 's out there ? 
could be the weight of the snow . 
what ? what is it ? 
well this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the sheriff . 
four or five days ago . why ? 
we actually got a phone call . busy morning . 
i appreciate that . thanks a lot . 
i hate that i made this call -- tell me i 'm being silly . 
no no of course not . it 's just that his daughter has n't heard from him and when he 's got a book coming out he usually keeps in touch . so when there was no word from him ... 
not quite . i just called and they said he checked out five days ago . is n't that a little strange ? 
i 'm sure you know paul 's been going to the silver creek lodge for years to finish his books . 
yes he is . 
i 'm a literary agent and i feel like a fool calling you but i think one of my clients paul sheldon might be in some kind of trouble . 
i thought you were over it . 
now you 've hurt me paul . 
paul since you brought her up i have to ask you this or i 'd be drummed out of the agents ' union-- what about a non - fiction book ? the truth about what went on in that house . 
i thought you 'd be thrilled . you 're being taken seriously . 
and my contacts at time and newsweek tell me they 're both raves . and do n't laugh -- for the first time i think you 've got a shot at some prizes . 
the word i 'm getting is the times review is gon na be a love letter . 
here it is .   very first copy . 
did they win ? 
no no . misery chastain put braces on your daughter 's teeth and is putting her through college bought you two houses and floor seats to the knick games and what thanks does she get ? you go and kill her . 
not a bad business . this thing would still be growing too . the first printing order on misery 's child was the most ever -- over a million . 
you 're still a writer . 
it 's ... it 's nice paul . it 's got ... character . 
what are you talking about ? 
if it 'll make you feel any better i wo n't do it again . 
not as much as you feel like hearing it . 
oh no not at all .   maybe just a bit . 
a change of plans ? 
sort it all out . 
i do n't know what to do about you sean . i 'm more than a bit muddled .   i need time . 
sean there 's something i 've been meaning to talk to you about ... is n't going to be easy for me to say . 
well that 's good is n't ? 
to win ? 
yeah .   naturally vain -- but they 're about to close the betting table and i have n't a sou .. 
' thief in the night ? ' 
i suppose i did . 
maybe that 's it then .   everything 's upside down and backwards ... 
only because .. it 's spring .. chalk it up   - to spring fever . 
you 're not interested in seeing how it looks . 
and my room ? 
your room . 
how do you that . 
how hard you had to work to get me out of there .. how in the world did you ever find me ? 
well that depends . 
i left in a bit of a hurry .   i 'm terribly grateful sean . 
no .   you just looked as if you did . 
i 'm infected with chimera .   you know you do n't have a choice .   just do it now . 
then you 'll have to kill me before it 's too late .   before i start killing people . 
i guess i lied .. you ca n't get both of us out of here can you ? 
i was n't thinking !   just .. trying to keep you from getting hurt that 's all . 
what ?   you told me to get out of here .   i thought you were here to collect me .   i was so relieved . 
ethan you know what frightens me most when i 'm with him? .. the thought of never seeing you .. how are we getting out of here ? 
i am now .   get me out of here .   just get me out of here . 
oh ethan ! .. 
how do you suggest i go about it ? 
ethan tell me - 
why ?   what 's happened . what did you see ? 
i managed . 
i 'll muddle through . 
where do i meet you ? 
-- his left jacket pocket . 
ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the london times .   what 's that about ? 
annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door . 
- michael his driver 's an aussie new to me .   then there 's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house . 
just about .. 
just like old times . 
ethan you take care of yourself i 'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove i 'm gon na bail - and without giving two week notice . 
oh i do .   but as we know i 'm a very poor judge of character . 
how can you possibly ?   i 've got to get right on the plane .   i 'm leaving now . 
very funny .. maybe he has heard and does n't want to know .   maybe he 's lost interest . 
this does n't seem to be accomplishing much . 
probably that i needed him in some urgent way .. destitute - in serious trouble .. the kind i could n't possible sort out myself .. 
sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of ' yoo - hoo - i'm- not - nad ' message .   not after the way we broke up . 
not me .   i was just hoping you might .. or that .. somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical . 
and that 's the only reason ? 
someone in possession of all the facts .   are you telling me i have to do this ? 
no .   you can be a thief and have a conscience :   not me .   why did you have to tell me about this !   what do i have to do to get away from this guy ?   when you 're with him he messes about with your head every waking moment .. even now i 'll be at some out - of- the - way - place a tin of caviar and a bottle of crystal shows up at the table with two glass god knows how he finds out at any given moment where i am in the world but he does .   and it looks like he 's done it again .   you know his definition of a   true paranoid ? 
but i do n't have a conscience .   i 'm a bloody thief . 
you 've either got it or you do n't .   let your conscience be your guide ? 
i 'd like a little more conviction .. 
but it is what you 'd like me to do . so tell me to do it .. 
not that it matter much but .. i seem to recall you staying something like ' i was hoping we could work together . ' 
that 's lot of people out there .. how many of them i wonder are capable of something like that ? 
there 's nearly 2 million in london . 
what 's the population of seville any idea ? 
that 's because i 'm on my back . 
ask a question you get an answer ! .. 
spoken like a spook .. you ever afraid ? 
well then what i am i doing here ?   i assume i 'm meant to be some sort of thief - to catch - a - thief .. 
you 're not a liar .   or you 're an awfully good one ..   .. this thing these blokes pinched .. 
that they 're lying . 
that 's not the point .   in the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you do n't . 
the only other spook i knew was a liar . charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth .   he 'd lie about his favorite color .   but then i reckon it 's an occupational hazard .   all spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies . 
they 've got a book for this ? 
when they 've got your recruiting technique ?   not a thing . 
who wants to be decent ? .. 
awfully short notice .. 
well ethan hunt what is it you want to talk to me about ? 
what 's you name ? 
oh bloody hell .   you 're a spy . 
your help ?   what are you talking about ? 
listen to what ? 
where did you get this number ?   i do n't even have it ! 
you 're apologizing for me ?   quite the gentleman .. 
sounds smashing .   i 'm in .   muchacho mi carro por favor !   now be serious .   you could n't possibly want me off tonight 's performance .. 
may i say something no offence ?   you look like a gigolo you sound like a thief you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind ? 
if you were n't going to let me get away with it why did you let me go thru with it ? 
i 'm missing something here aside from a 500000 pound necklace .   even after i botched the job i could 've walked out of there with the bloody thing . 
do what ? 
- right .. 
- this is very disconerting .. 
where 's the bloody - 
- right .. where is it ? 
would you mind if i 'm on top ? 
i see .   you 're not just another pretty face .. 
what are you doing here ? 
uh - huh . 
look it 's either you or the rent and i do n't mind telling you it 's not an easy choice . 
not tonight .   bad timing .   sorry - 
no .   just as if i 'd like to . 
no .   should i ? 
donít jim . 
all ten million . 
jim - lets just get the money and get out of here . 
ethan if you knew about jim? .. why .. 
you knew about jim ? 
krieger can get it .   right ? 
itís all right ethan .. youíll bring me back ... wonít you ... 
this stuff is so sticky . 
ethanís right behind me .   listen to me jim .   is it such a good idea to kill him ? we take the money .   ethan takes the blame .   no - one else has seen you alive . no - one will believe him . 
two cars .   where are you ? 
ethan ... kittridge is on the train . 
yes ....... come here .... viens pres moi ... 
what happened ? 
what are you going to do ? 
i 'm going to try and get some sleep . 
i 'm so sorry .   krieger was my call .   i 've never worked with him .   i 'm sorry ethan . 
what about you ? 
you did n't have to ......... 
you do n't think we 're going to make it . 
what kind of help ? 
jim was my husband . i want to know who killed him .   i want to get the son of a bitch who did this . 
we 've got seventy - five rounds for your glock 9 but only twenty for the sig sauer one pair of visco glasses with monitor plenty of passports . you said it yourself -- if i 'm not dead i 'm with you . 
max made a deal with you ? 
the message is for job . 
ethan you 're not making sense . let me go in and talk to kittridge . i 'm going to tell him you had nothing to do ... 
what are you going to do ? 
why have n't they brought us in yet ? 
no one sent me !   we 're supposed to be back here at four o'clock four o'clock if we abort we do n't return here until four o'clock 0 - four hundred four am four o'clock -- ! 
who is they who is they ? 
i walked away .   he said abort .   he was gone so i walked away . 
they 're dead .   jim 's dead . 
what happened to jim ? 
what happened to jim ? 
no i got out of the car and i ran to the bridge . 
i was n't .   i heard that jim was in trouble on the radio .   he said someone was ... 
ethan -- ethan it 's okay .   it 's claire . ethan what 's wrong with you ? 
roger that . 
oh yeah ? 
are < u > you</u > all right ethan .   what 's wrong with you ? 
sleeping 's better . 
i 'm walking . 
i want to sleep .   can i sleep here . 
did we get it ? 
i wouldnít worry about him .   once youíve got the money -- heíll find you . 
the possibility alone is worth ten million .   baggage car rack 3 .   silver briefcase .   combination 314 . 
ha dear boy !   i do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private . 
i 'm going to have to front you personally .   do n't lose that money without losing your life . 
how will you make sure i 'll have the list in three days ?   it 's been a delight .   now where can i drop you dear boy ? 
done .   bring it to me in london .   i want it by the end of the week . 
six million dollars .   i 'll give you the same .   but i want the complete list now not just eastern europe .   i wo n't do this piecemeal it 's too dangerous .   i want the < u > entire</u > list the true name of every non - official cover agent throughout the world . 
i do n't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket .   my deal with job was subject to a successful boot scan .   obviously it did n't pass muster .   deal 's off . 
very good . 
mm - hmmm ... 
it 's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say i ca n't look at the information and < u > see</u > if it 's worthless . not a tenable position sir . 
why should i ? 
i do n't know job any more than he knows me . 
why may i ask ? 
ah but we 're asking about you . 
and how might you know that ?   are you another company man ? 
it 's quite out of the question . 
on what ? 
the penny drops .   < u > you</u > are < u > not</u > job .   yes job is not given to quoting scripture in his communications . and there was its tone -- aggressive but playful .   job is not playful .   so you 're something of a paradox . 
really ?   and you thought if you simply showed up i might give it to you ? 
who are you and what are you doing here ? 
phew !   weíve got five minutes ... 
run it through from the top . 
is something wrong with the phone ?   well is something wrong with the batteries ? 
try it again . 
whatís the problem . 
this wasnít what we discussed . 
how long until we reach the chunnel ? 
does n't mean it 's a signal .   could just be the hard drive heating up . 
that 's not so good for you my friend . 
your life is not built on nothing . ti amo . 
and go to confession . 
i want you to stop seeing her . 
have i been a good wife ? 
cosmo this is ronny johnny 's brother . 
you 're welcome . 
i just want you to know . no matter what you do . you are going to die just like everybody else . 
where you been ? 
why you drinking so much ? 
well what do you wanna talk about ! 
he did n't used to be cheap . he thinks if he holds on to his money he will never die . 
you 're rich as roosevelt . you 're just cheap cosmo . 
you 're not gon na marry him cosmo . do you love him loretta ? 
again ? johnny cammareri . 
who 's dead ? 
oh god that 's too bad . 
do you love him loretta ? 
i guess it ai n't modern times in sicily . he came right from the airport . he wanted to talk to you . you got a love bite on your neck . he 's coming back this morning . 
it was a miracle . 
she recovered . 
no more he 's not . 
upstairs . johnny cammareri showed up last night . 
no . but i have a hangover . 
are you drunk ? 
your hair 's different . 
what the hell happened to you ? 
a wife knows . 
cosmo 's cheating on me . 
just like your father . i lied to him . he thinks you came home last night . 
where you been ? 
did he tell her ? 
how 's the mother ? 
no . he do n't . 
and we 'll sell the house . 
what 's thirty - seven ? i had chiro after i was thirty - seven . it ai n't over till it 's over . 
grandma was still alive . chiro was still home going to school . now he 's married and gone to florida . if you and johnny moved in had a baby ... 
so we 'll sell the house . 
why not ? 
will you live here ? 
and who 's gon na pay for that ? 
good . when you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can . but you like him ? 
okay i 'll tell her . 
no idea . 
he does n't like you . thank you for answering my question . 
no that 's really it . thank you for answering my question . 
that 's it ! that 's the reason ! 
but why would a man need more than one woman ? 
that was my father - in - law who has a wrong idea in his head . listen johnny there 's a question i want to ask you . and i want you to tell me the truth if you can . why do men chase women ? 
that 's incredible . 
you 're kidding ? 
a miracle . well that 's news . 
what are you doing here ? you 're supposed to be in palermo . 
out . i do n't know where . i was waiting up for my husband . 
she 's not home yet . take off your coat and come in the living room . i 'll make you a drink . i wanna talk to you . 
come on in . 
moving in ? 
good night . 
good night . 
i 'm too old for you . 
you 're a little boy and you like to be bad . 
no . i think the house is empty . i ca n't invite you in because i 'm married and because i know who i am . you 're shaking . 
what you do n't know about women is a lot . 
i think it 's because they fear death . 
why do men chase women ? 
i 'm not eating alone . can i ask you a question ? 
i 'm a housewife . 
do n't shit where you eat . 
there 's old saying my mother told me . would you like to hear it ? 
that woman was a student of yours ? 
what do you do ? 
will you join me for dinner ? 
none of your business . 
she was just too young for you . 
i 'm not disturbed . by you . 
i do n't know whether i saw you or not . 
you 're my father . 
you 're married . 
what are you doing here ? 
i got it done . 
so you 'll come to the wedding right ? 
it 's temporary . 
i did n't have no wedding cake no reception or nothing . johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at the grand ticino . 
and maybe that 's why i had the bad luck . maybe if you gave me away and i got married in a church in a wedding dress instead of at the city hall with strangers standing outside the door maybe then i would n't had the bad luck i had . 
you 've got to come . you 've got to give me away . 
in a month . 
he 's flying to sicily . his mother 's dying . 
johnny cammareri . 
he got hit by a bus . 
the guy died . 
i 'm getting married . 
you look tired . 
here .   ti amo . 
pop i got news . 
you 're not sleepy ? 
where 's ma ? 
before all these people yes i will marry you ronny cammareri ! 
i 'm talking about a promise . you proposed to me ! 
what the hell are you talking about ? we 're engaged . 
no i 'll tell him .   what am i going to tell him ? 
ronny please ... 
you 've got ta get outta here . 
he 's coming . 
i 'm freezing to death . 
let me go home . 
let me go home . 
why not ? 
and you 're not now ? 
i 'm afraid of who i am . 
i 'm really afraid . 
i went with you .   now i 'm gon na marry johnny and you 're gon na leave me alone .   right ?   a person can see where they 've messed up in their life and they can change how they do things and they can change their luck . maybe my nature does draw me to you but i do n't haveta go with that . i can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that 's just gon na ruin everything ! i can do that . otherwise what is this stupid life that god gave us for what ?   ronny ? are you listening to me ? 
the deal was if i came to the opera with you you 'd leave me alone forever . 
this is where we 're going ! 
this is your place . 
you 're late ! 
he did n't come ! 
i know what i know . 
you are guilty . i 'm guilty . 
how can you ask me that ? 
it 's really cold . 
i wanna go home . 
no thanks . 
i could n't believe it ! i did n't think she was going to die . i knew she was sick ... 
beautiful . sad . she died ! 
that was just so ... awful ! 
i like parts of it but i do n't really get it . 
they get some turnout for this stuff . 
so . where are we sitting ? 
for what ? 
kinda gaudy . 
who painted that ? 
i thought i 'd try it .   you look good . 
alright . where 's the met ? 
what are you talking about ? 
but that 's cause he do n't know ! 
i 'm telling you you ca n't . 
alright . then i must never see you again . the bad blood will have to stay there between you and johnny for all time . you wo n't come to the wedding . 
snap out of it ! 
why not ? 
last night never happened you hear me ? i 'm gon na marry him anyway and last night never happened and you and i are gon na take this to our coffins ! 
oh yes oh yes you did ! you 've got those bad eyes like a gypsy ! why did n't i see it yesterday ! bad luck ! is that all i 'm ever gon na have ? why did n't i just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago ? i 'm gon na marry him ! 
that 's impossible ! it was ruint when i got here ! you ruint my life ! 
what did i do ? 
you do n't get along with anybody ! 
you 're invited to the wedding ! it 's in a few weeks . why did n't you do like him and be with your dying mother in palermo ? 
i 'm marrying your brother ! 
i thought if i stayed away from the city hall i wo n't have that bad luck i had again . 
this time i was trying to do everything right . 
what ? what have we done ? 
oh my god . 
i 've never seen a moon like that . 
that light . 
you 're mad at him take it out on me take your revenge on me ! take everything leave nothing for him to marry ! hollow me out so there 's nothing left but the skin over my bones . suck me dry ! 
get all of me . take everything . 
i want to cut you open and crawl inside of you . i want you to swallow me . 
all my life i have never reached a man . i knew that i would reach my husband but i took my time and he was dead . ronny . 
i was dead too . 
me neither . 
oh . oh god . i do n't care about anything . i do n't care about anything ! take me to the bed . 
where are you taking me ? 
a wolf without a foot ! 
i am looking where i should to become a bride ! 
because i have no luck ! 
i 'm telling you your life ! 
the big part of you has no words and it's - a wolf . this woman was a trap for you . she caught you and you could not get away .   so you chewed off your foot ! that was the price you had to pay to be free .   johnny had nothing to do with it . you did what you had to do between you and you and i know i 'm right i do n't care what you say . and now you 're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love . that 's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman . you are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again ! 
i was raised that a girl gets married young . i did n't get married until i was twenty - eight . i met a man . i loved him . i married him . he wanted to have a baby right away . i said no . then he got hit by a bus . no man . no baby . no nothing ! i did not know that man was a gift i could not keep . i did n't know ... you tell me a story and you think you know what it means but i see what the true story is and you ca n't .   she did n't leave you ! you ca n't see what you are . i can see everything . you are a wolf ! 
you really are stupid you know that . 
you think so ? 
you got any whiskey ? how 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey ? 
what ? do you think you 're the only one ever shed a tear ? 
no . unlucky . i have not been lucky . 
just johnny . 
seven years ago . 
so . five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man . no woman since then ? 
why what ? 
bus hit him . 
he knew my husband who died . 
you 'll eat this bloody to feed your blood . 
i know that . i do what i want . 
i 'm making you a steak . 
but that was n't johnny 's fault . 
that 's the bad blood between you and johnny ? 
maybe i should come back another time . 
i do n't understand . 
excuse me . 
yes . do you want ... 
i 'm going to marry him . 
let me come and talk to you . 
he 's in palermo . 
i 'm calling for your brother johnny . he 's getting married and he wants you to come . 
you ? no . 
yeah i 'll be in . 
bye aunt rita . 
i got a lot on my mind aunt rita . 
i got things to do . 
where 's the ring ? 
in time you will drop dead and i will come to your funeral in a red dress . 
and you 're a big liar ! i 've got your ring here ! 
i have no secrets from my family . 
johnny i have something to tell you . 
i ca n't . i need my family around me now . 
i do n't know . but johnny how did your mother recover ? she was dying . 
have you told her we 're getting married ? 
how was your plane ride ? 
you have a brother ? 
who is he ? 
you 've made me very happy johnny . 
i 'll take care of it johnny . i 'll take care of the whole thing . all you have to do is show up . 
a month from today ? 
where ? at the city hall ? no ! i want the whole wedding or we will have bad luck . for a whole wedding to be planned a date must be set . 
how about a month from today ? 
then let 's set the date . 
how near is she to death ? 
what about the wedding ? 
so we 'll pick up the car we 'll make the plane in plenty of time . 
what time is it ? 
you propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement . 
i helped you buy it . it came with two pairs of pants . it 's for luck johnny . when you propose marriage to a woman you should kneel down . 
yes on the floor . 
right from the start we did n't do it right . could you kneel down ? 
we got married at the city hall and i think it gave bad luck the whole marriage . 
you know i was married and that my husband died . but what you do n't know is i think he and i had bad luck . 
are you proposing marriage to me ? 
bobo take the cart away . 
i should n't . 
what 's the matter ? 
you never have dessert . 
she was too young for him . 
give him the manicotta bobo . me too . 
it 's the oily fish tonight . not before the plane ride . 
you do n't want the fish . 
yeah ma i love him awful . 
a miracle ? this is modern times ! there ai n't supposed to be miracles any more ! 
what ! ! she was dying ! 
he 's with his dying mother ! 
what ? he 's in sicily ! 
where 's pop ? 
no . are you drunk ? 
everything 's different . 
well . i do n't really know where to start . 
then you do n't know . you 're just imagining it . he 's too old . 
what ! how do you know ? 
thanks . what 's the matter with you ? 
i do n't wanna talk about it . 
not yet . that old lady makes him sweat .   where 's that card ? 
she 's dying . but i could still hear her big mouth . 
i 'd like to stay ma . i love the house . but pop do n't like johnny . 
johnny has a big apartment . we 'll live there . 
i 'm thirty - seven years old . 
i got married before you did n't sell . 
pop do n't like johnny . 
oh yeah . he 's a sweet man . i wanna have a big church wedding ma . and a reception . 
the bank . oh my god i forgot to make the deposit ! 
hi . why ai n't you at the store ? 
listen i got ta go . i 'll take the deposit to the bank but i 'll do the books tomorrow . i got ta go . 
what about the moon ? 
what 's the matter with him ? 
i know . 
i know . 
i ... a ... slept with my fiancé 's brother . 
twice i took the name of god in vain once i slept with the brother of my fiancé and once i bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident . 
bless me father for i have sinned . it 's been two months since my last confession . 
it 's johnny cammareri . 
is there anything you want to tell us honey ? 
hi loretta . 
bye bye honey . see you tomorrow ? 
what 's the matter ? you look crazy . 
sure you do . you got all that wedding stuff . 
we did n't know what to think . you were so weird yesterday and then this morning we go to the bank and no bag . 
she 's got it . 
what are you talking about you fool ? her fiancé 's in palermo . 
you got me . 
raymond raymond lower your voice ! what 's got into you ? 
shut up . they 'll hear you in the back . 
you were a tiger last night . 
you know in this light and with that expression on your face you look about twenty - five years old . 
what would he be doing down there ? 
is who down there ? 
what are you talking about raymond ? cosmo ca n't own the moon . 
what ? what ? 
marriage is happy news . 
and that is my last word on the matter . 
brown 's responsibilities are onerous enough already .   he has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed . the smoking - room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock . 
it is quite late enough . 
it is a disgusting habit bertie .   it should be discouraged . 
i do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me . doctor jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box ! 
... least of all my son .   it was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave . 
cold is good--   is that not so dr. jenner ? ! 
no dinners bertie .   why are you dressed for outdoors ? 
yes .   yes it was . 
you should never have gone out in such foul weather . 
then why send me back to them ? ! 
i will not hear any more about my safety ! !   you made me a promise and now you have broken it ! 
you are forcing me to do the very thing you know i fear most ! 
-- you stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me ! 
i can not believe you are saying this ? you who i have relied on all this time -- 
duty ? !   you talk about duty ? ! 
the queen forbids it .   i can not allow it because i can not live without you .   without you i can not find the strength to be who i must be .   please . 
i do not accept . 
has someone seen to those bruises ? 
i was told you were in a fight . 
the threat from the irish is greatly exaggerated i 'm sure . 
am i not safe enough with you john ? 
dear me you 'll be telling me to watch what i eat next . 
must they always follow us ? 
what is it john ?   john ? 
to keep out the cold . 
i hope they did n't go to any trouble john . 
what mr ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming .   literary appreciation does not begin and end with tennyson . 
of course i shall say what i have to say .   i always do . 
i do not do it for others .   but ponsonby thinks they are good . 
his remarks were directed at the quality of the writing not its subject . 
he has been attending at balmoral for many years . 
sir henry ponsonby tells me they are charming . 
i am told so . 
craobhan - geanmchno ...   how can i possibly say that with a straight face ? ! 
those over there there . 
what are those ? 
it is a fine spot for a bench is it not ? 
sir henry is not alone .   they all wish it .   the same people who refused to grant my husband the title of king because he was deemed of insufficient rank-- 
he thought so yes . 
prince albert was going to build a bench here .   he thought it one of the best views in osborne . 
the queen will ride out if and when she chooses . 
then why do you persist in doing it ? 
you have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so . 
mr brown . 
yes .   that will be company for you . 
yes .   you have a brother in service here do you not ?   i forget his name . 
my husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you .   he would have approved i am sure of my calling on you in this way .   i trust it does not inconvenience you too much . 
your family sent cards .   it was much appreciated . 
and the pony ? 
you are well ? 
you are here safely . 
mr brown . 
i have asked him to show you a little of highland life while you are with us at balmoral . 
this is my good john brown . 
i stay here because i am happy .   is that such a terrible crime ? 
i never thought to be bullied by you mr disraeli .   you i thought understood a widow 's grief . 
is that not enough ? 
then they may read about me . 
but i lack your prose mr disraeli . 
how ill is he ? 
why was i not informed ? 
no .   you are mistaken .   prince albert my husband had typhoid fever .   i asked what was wrong with my son . 
i will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy .... 
why am i being lectured in this way ? ! 
cold is good ! 
why was i not told earlier ? 
how long has he been this sick ? 
has he been hurt ? 
i made no request to go out riding today .   how long has he been there ? 
what is he doing there ? 
just them ? 
please tell the princess and other signatories to this letter that the queen will not be dictated to or made to alter in any way what she has found to answer for her comfort .   do i make myself clear ? 
what do they want ? 
my family is quite capable of communicating with the queen in person . 
from whom ? 
what is it ? 
is it not enough that she is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors ? !   i am not a fool .   i know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends . sometimes -- i feel that brown is all i have left of albert .   and now they attack brown too . 
no - one should think themselves wiser than me !   it is not for any of the queen 's subjects to presume to tell her majesty when and where she should come out of mourning .   it is the queen 's sorrow that keeps her secluded !   it is her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility work which she feels will soon wear her out entirely ! 
why not ? 
who told them that ? 
read it ! 
read it . 
and now i am back . 
we stayed a little longer than expected with mr and mrs grant .   it was most agreeable . 
no .   i shall be out walking . 
please make sure it does not happen again . 
sir henry mr brown is standing in the courtyard .   i have no wish to go riding . 
what is the matter with him ? 
then why are you not with him ? 
why is he not here ? 
where is my son ? 
that 's a very pretty shawl you are wearing alex .   silk suits you well .   but you are not eating enough .   one must not let vanity overrule one 's appetite . 
the donor .   maybe he 's alive inside the game . 
maybe he 's not dead . 
but how can it change every time ? 
how do you do that ? 
what 's the question mark ? 
we vere thinking there might be tricks . you know surprises that you 'd worked into the game ... 
we 're having some problems with arcade ... 
there 's something wrong with arcade . the game 's alive somehow ... 
neither are we .   something 's wrong with the game mr. difford . 
it 's the game arcade . 
how 'd you know it was us ? 
but you always lie so you did n't come from there .   that means the city on the left must be the city of truth . 
liar .   did you come from the city on the left or the city on the right ? 
did you play arcade last night ? 
everybody 's sick huh ?   it 's fifteen after .   we always meet here you know that . 
has anyone seen greg ? 
i just thought of something .   if we came back from the game ...   ... what if arcade did too ? 
never been on a snowboard . 
there never is . 
one of them anyway ...   did you see it ?   the screamer ? 
we do n't have a choice ! 
look around ... 
our time 's up . 
check your read - out . 
yeah that 's what worries me . 
the clock 's already ticking . 
the keys are supposed to be at the end of each level .   once we get all the keys we can unlock arcade 's heart . and then ... 
you 've got the schematics check . 
got it . 
yeah well i figure these are unusual circumstances . 
one .   in case ... 
you feel it ?   it 's different this time . 
i already have a boyfriend nick . 
and what if something happens to you ? am i suppose to go in after you alone ? ! 
yes i am ... 
yes it does .   do n't you see ?   we have to play by the rules .   that 's what it wants . 
put in a quarter . 
what are you looking for ? 
you did n't hear me ? 
dante 's inferno . 
you got the schematics ? 
i ca n't believe you made it ! 
what are you going to do ? 
no i 'm not ... 
virgin sacrifices ? 
i was afraid you 'd say that . 
and beat it at it 's own game . 
they made arcade .   it 's still a game right ?   it thinks like a game .   maybe it still has to play by the rules . someone had to program it in the first place did n't they ? . 
slip - stream . 
then where do we go ? ! 
the police then ... 
anywhere .   we have to stop it from getting out . 
... but then it hits the relay stations ... 
like the fractals ? 
nick what is it . 
where do we go ? 
we ca n't ... 
change the channel ! 
let 's go around back . 
this is like a movie or something .   i mean am i paranoid or what ? 
laurie 's . 
she thought benz was at school . 
if they 're sick great .   but let 's make sure .   come on nick . 
we have to find out what 's happened to them . i think they 're gone ... 
because i did n't know where else to go . 
all of them ? 
something 's happened to them . 
call the others .   laurie benz ... 
it turned itself back on nick . 
so how did it know my name then ? 
it is . 
no .   look i know you 're not going to believe me but listen anyway ...   i think the game 's alive somehow . 
turn if off ! 
can you turn off the game ? 
greg never came home .   a few hours is one thing nick but this is different . something 's happened to him . 
i 'm coming over . 
no in person .   now . 
i have to talk to you . 
listen to me !   greg never came home . i think the game has something to do with it . 
but he was playing the game .   i mean you saw him ... 
so where is he ? 
well it 's a long story ... 
go for it . 
and then keep on driving ? 
i 'm okay . 
i know . 
oh god ... oh god ... 
in this world wrong is right ! 
which way ? 
then we 'll go home . 
thought so . 
how did you get here ?   did you play the game ? ! 
i 'm thinking ! 
think !   i want to go to the city of truth and the truth teller is from there ... but which one is which ?   the liar ... think ! 
wait !   no !   that 's not it ! 
what did he do to you ? 
is ... is that where we are ?   did i die ? 
yes ... but ... how did you ... 
but i do n't understand ... 
mom ?   you 're alive ... 
okay but you do n't know what you 're missing . 
i 'm just offering a place to stay . 
i 'll call him then call you back ... if you want you could stay at my place . 
will you meet with him ? 
sort of funny boy . if i tell him the meeting 's on you 're to go to the top of beachwood canyon . there 's a corral up there where he 'll be . 
it 's been a very strange day . 
something tells me this guy is connected with what 's happening adam and i think you should do it and i think you should do it right away . 
yeah the cowboy . this guy the cowboy wants to see you . jason said he thought it would be a good idea . 
do you know somebody called the the cowboy ? 
i know but you 're broke . where are you ? 
you 're broke ! 
someone called me . when they could n't get you they told me you were as good as broke . i did n't believe then so i made some calls . 
i know .   where are you adam ? 
adam this is n't like you . please come to the office . there must be something we can do . 
home ! meet me at the office . we 've got to do something ... you 've got to do something adam ! 
you 've got to talk to ray you 've got to fix this . 
ray did ... and then they closed the set .... everybody 's gone . you 'd better get down here adam ! 
they fired everyone . 
they 've closed the set . they sent everybody home . 
adam where are you ? 
good luck honey ! 
get going . you do n't want to be late . 
naw ! he would n't have cared . just give him a good performance and he 'll be happy and i 've got a feeling you 'll do just that . 
his name 's wally brown .... great guy . been in the business since forever . 
it 's all right gorgeous . something wrong ? 
do n't make me out to be a sucker . louise bonner says there 's trouble in there . you remember last night . sometimes she 's wrong but if there is trouble - get rid of it . 
so i guess your grandpa and grandma know her . 
sweetie look at me straight . 
she wants to know who 's staying in her apartment . 
your aunt called me . 
you got it ! see you later honey . 
now i guess you and your aunt have an understanding . so here 's the key and you need anything just give a holler .   everybody in this building 's pretty much okay with me or they would n't be here . if you want later i 'll introduce you around . no hard feelings if you do n't and do n't forget the rooftop garden . it 's just up the stairs we passed . it 's open to all the tenants . you can see the hollywood sign from there . 
i told ya . 
that 's good . they 're allowed but i do n't like 'em ... for obvious reasons . one man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo . you would n't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let 's see your aunt 's apartment ... it 's a good one . 
sweetheart you do n't know the half of it . 
honey all the great ones came through here at one time or another . 
you probably do n't remember her but louise bonner lives right over there in number 29 . when she is n't drunk she runs a damn good acting class . 
damn lot of corn raised in hollywood these days too . 
i guess it was your grandfather was it ... he called me to check in said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in . nice man ... farmer i hear . 
right . see ya . 
thanks coco . i 'll let you know . 
thanks coco . it 'd be so embarrassing 
no no . i 'm on my way to my audition . before i go i wanted to ask you if you could remember the man 's name ... aunt ruthie 's friend who helped put this together . it completely went out of my mind . 
sorry to trouble you coco . 
you 're really something coco ... thank you . 
not really . i met her in junior college and she was from this other town . 
coco ... she 's very nice . we went to school together . 
it 's just for a night or two until she finds her own place . i tried to explain that to aunt ruth but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up . i kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she did n't know any ritas ... 
i was afraid of that . 
oh coco thank you . thank you so much . 
it 's unbelievable ! 
i can hardly wait coco . 
no i do n't . 
i guess i 've come to quite a place . 
have many famous actors and actresses lived here ? i was meaning to ask you that . 
well i ... 
yes he is . he raises corn . 
hi ... do you work with my aunt ? 
oh my god . i 'm sorry . i 'll let you get back to that . i 'm going to get unpacked . 
are you okay ? 
i understand . i saw the dress . i ... i'm sorry .    are you all right ? 
i 'm ruth 's niece . my name 's betty . i 'm sure she told you i was coming . 
no no i 'm fine . 
very pleased to meet you . 
stop ... just stop ! that 's what you said from the beginning . if i tell what happened ... they 'll arrest you and put you in jail so get out of here before ... 
i can call them ... i can call my dad . 
you 're still here ? 
was anyone hurt ? 
can you tell me what happened ? 
hi . i 'm inquiring ... well i heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and i want to know if there was an accident on mulholland drive . 
well ... we 'll leave her a note . 
but it said # 12 . 
hey let 's introduce the brand new you to hollywood . we have n't seen the roof garden yet . 
no . we should n't touch that money . we do n't know about that money . that might be dangerous money . you have to start all over again . you look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person ... whoever you want to be . 
rita ... i want you to stay here and you do n't have to give me that money . 
i know what you have to do but let me do it . 
rita ... i know what you 're doing . 
c'm on help me in . i 'll open the front door . 
keep going . go around to the back . 
do you know them ? ! 
what is it ? what do you see ? ! 
you 're not going to get in trouble . you 're going to find out who you are . finding out who you are gets you out of trouble . 
why did n't you ask him ? sol knows you ! 
when i get back i 'll have the cab waiting so be ready to go . 
i hope i 'm back in a couple of hours . do n't drink all the coke . 
everything is a - okay but i 've got ta get that sandwich ! 
you 've got to eat something . you 're just nervous about going over to see if you 're diane selwyn . 
oh no wonder i 'm starving . i 'm going to fix a sandwich . you want one ? 
i know you 're afraid of something . we 'll be careful . tomorrow we 'll go over there and we 'll find out . 
what 's wrong with that ? 
maybe the voice is n't diane selwyn . maybe that 's your roommate or if it is diane selwyn she can tell you who you are . 
call the number . 
strange to be calling yourself . 
we 'll take our check . 
not that i can see . 
come on ... let 's find you something to wear . 
just to see if there was an accident on mulholland drive . 
we could call anonymously from a pay phone ... just to see if there was an accident . 
maybe that 's where the accident was . there must be a police report . we could call . 
mulholland drive ? 
when you think about them ... the money ... the key ... does it make you remember anything ? 
the money . you do n't know where it came from ? 
you do n't remember anything else ? 
how do you remember how to talk ? 
well ... if you do n't remember anything i mean what goes through your mind then if you do n't remember anything ? 
well ...   what do you think about then ? i mean ...   well what do you think about ? 
what do you mean ? you 're rita . 
what 's wrong ? 
what is it rita ? 
all right but ... i'm going to check on you . 
if you have a concussion you should n't sleep . 
but this could be serious . 
she sure is . she 's letting me stay here while she 's working on a movie that 's being made in canada but i guess you know that .   i could n't afford a place like this in a million years . unless of course i 'm discovered and become a movie star . of course i 'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star but sometimes people end up being both and that is i guess you 'd say sort of why i came here . i 'm sorry i 'm just so excited to be here .. i mean i just came here from iowa and now i 'm in this dream place . you can imagine how i feel . 
i ... i mean ...... i ... it 's none of my business . 
thank you ... thank you very much . 
betty elms . 
yes sir . 
no we do n't . 
wally brown . 
to my audition . 
it sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new . 
but i want to . 
what ... i .. have ... to do . 
i do n't think ... 
no ... but ... 
those men in front in the car . 
do n't stop ! 
but i do n't know sol . i never heard of sol . i 'd just get in trouble . that 's why we should n't go see about diane selwyn ... it 's better not to get in trouble . 
good luck ! 
is everything all right ? is it bad for you that i 'm here ? 
i 'm all right . 
i 'm not sure about this . 
maybe ... maybe ... maybe . 
it 's not my voice ... but i know her . 
maybe it 's not me . 
no . just the coffee . 
there 's nothing ? 
okay ... but just ... just to see . 
no .... i do n't ... 
that 's where i was going ... mulholland drive . 
mulholland drive . 
unh unh . 
no   there is something ... something there i ca n't tell ... i ca n't describe it .   there are things there .... but i 'm ... here . 
i do n't know . 
nothing . i do remember the car crash ... i told you ... i remember the glass ... i think about that sometimes ... i remember walking here sort of . now i remember this place and you . that 's about it . 
what do you mean ? 
i 'm not . i do n't know what my name is . i do n't know who i am ! ! 
i do n't know who i am . 
i'm ... i'm ... oh no ... i thought when i woke up ... i thought sleep would do it ... 
it will be okay if i sleep . i need to lie down and sleep . 
no ... i need to sleep . 
i think i 've been hurt . 
she has pretty red hair ... she is very kind i think . 
no .......... i. 
no they 're not . i wanna be a writer i wanna be just like you . 
i 'm sure she found your lectures fascinating . 
people said she looked like me . 
her name was maggie muldovan . 
my mother took this course with you at ucla ... &quot;the foundations of poetic thought&quot ; . 
do you still teach ? 
umm where do you want this ? 
are you writing a poem ? 
i do n't even know your name . 
thank you . 
i do n't think you 're very polite . 
put that down i'll ... i'll call the police ! 
gee that is a problem . 
are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem . 
this is california anything is possible . 
where is he ? ? he was supposed to meet me . 
how did you know my name ? 
i 'm not supposed to talk to strangers not even nuns . 
do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life ? 
i 'm leaving sunday . 
his name is jeffrey pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 ford pickup black with red interior . please ? 
suspended from school my mother ? ? 
wow you walked out with my mother ? 
what do you remember about her . 
can i see him ? 
we have a baby ? 
what happened to shelly ? 
give my love to shelly . 
okay ... bye daddy i love you . 
i will . how 's shelly ? 
actually i wanna see jeffrey pommeroy . 
i just called to say that i 'm having a really great time . 
hi dad . 
i 'll be back in 137 hours . 
bye dad i 'll miss you . 
what does that mean ? 
no nuns got it . 
i used my own money and got a great deal it 's a q47nr five day fare which means that i have to change planes in dallas and stay over a saturday . 
i already bought a ticket . 
i think that if i 'm old enough to accept a new baby and if i 'm old enough to accept a new room i 'm old enough to go to california . 
you were just having a fight about me . would n't you like to hear my opinion ? 
was it a nice funeral ? 
oh is there anything else you remember how did you propose ? was it romantic ? 
there 's still a big spot on the floor . 
the collected works of alfred biedermeyer 
so you 're saying ... what are you saying ? ? 
it 's just a question it 's not about anybody . 
dad when a boy likes you does he pretend that he does n't like you ? and if he pretends that he does n't like you how can you tell that he likes you ? 
dad i 'm kidding you can have the room . 
do n't do that you 've got the whole garage . 
maybe i should just move to china . one kid per family that way you do n't lose your room . 
no it 's okay i understand really . 
i figured you did . 
shelly 's already told me all about sex . 
you 're passing up archie bunker to go bowling you 've got ta have an angle . 
so what 's on your mind ? 
visualize a spare ? 
okay no problem . 
you want me to move ? 
do what ? 
i do n't know if i can picture uncle phil body surfing . 
dad i 'm trying .   the chairs they wo n't scrunch . 
they sure did ! they got kicked out of school they married truck drivers ... these are my mother 's greatest accomplishments ? i 'm sure glad i came all the way out here to find them out . 
are you saying my mother had another husband ? 
what 're you saying ? 
his name 's harry sultenfuss . 
it 's okay really i was just a baby . 
are you the hillary mitchell who went to school with maggie muldovan ? 
i guess what i mean is my mother married my dad after you ... and then i was born so i thought that ... maybe you got divorced because of me . 
i thought that ... umm ... maybe you 'd be curious about how i turned out . 
umm ... didn't you ever wonder about me ? 
more than anything in the world . 
she 's beautiful . 
do you have any pictures if her ? 
and she saved it . 
i do n't know very much about her ... i was hoping that you could help me . 
special effects ? 
i told you it was a long story . 
oh she 's great ... she 's a little crazy though . anyway hillary said that you had a black ford truck and this policeman i know got in touch with motor vehicles and ... he gave me your address and here i am . 
we have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and i chose my mother . she was born in los angeles and since my uncle phil moved out here i came in to visit him and then i looked at her high school yearbook and ...   and i called a few people and one guy said that she went to ucla another guy said that i should call hillary mitchell so .... 
you are ? 
bye .   she looks a little like me when i was a little girl . 
i 'd like to thanks . 
you mean you knew about me ? 
i am vada margaret sultenfuss . my mother was ... 
well actually i was born in siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my dad . 
well ... i'm not supposed to talk about it but since i 'm gon na write about it i might as well tell you . she was a spy against the russians . 
hi wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow ? 
that 's ridiculous so if you really ca n't stand someone then you pretend that you 're really crazy about them ? 
likes me ? he said i looked like a grasshopper . 
what 's the matter ? 
see you ? he can smell you from there . 
what are you staring at ? 
neither can mine . she 's dead . it 's shelly who 's pregnant . 
you should be here when they bring in a body that 's been dead for a couple of days and they have n't found it yet 'cause it was in an apartment and no - one came to visit or floating in a river and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green you know like watery pea soup ? the arms and legs deteriorate first the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs . anyway this is why i 'm seriously considering cremation . judy ? ? 
it 's just a corpse . 
come on in ! 
that 's simple . she was pregnant with me ... when she went to russia and she did n't know ... and then when the russians found out they waited to shoot her 'cause you 're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world . 
no not here in pennsylvania she went to russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back . just when she was about to go home she got caught and they killed her . 
no - one invented gravity it just exists . 
but i wanna write about her . 
it 's okay with me hi kevin . 
are you jeffrey pommeroy ? 
you 're alfred beidermeyer are n't you ? 
he 's writing . hello ? 
o.k. thank you very much . 
this is really very nice of you . 
thanks but i think i 'm gon na stick to my mom she led a fascinating life too . 
great i have so much to say i hardly know where to start . 
i never met my mother . 
my mother . 
the poem is really about attitude . it 's about not giving up and ... it 's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but ... that 's when we should ... force ourselves to push on . 
i 'll write you ten poems .   bye . 
an adventure ? 
you mean ... it was n't that terrible ? 
... umm ... listen i 'm sorry ... you had to sacrifice your entire vacation . 
and i 'm gon na use the movies when i give my report . jeffrey says audiences love special effects . 
this has been a real confusing day . 
maybe this jeffrey guy is ... is my real father . i mean ... look at me i have the hair of a dead person and ... and my nose no one in my family has this nose it could be the nose of ... a ... of a complete stranger 
maybe not ... but maybe it does . if no one told me about this i mean ... maybe they 're trying to hide something . 
no but sometimes he drives a hearse . 
it 's not his fault ! 
marriage can really complicate things . so are n't you gon na say anything about my earrings ? 
oh no we would n't be from the same bloodlines or anything . we 'd be like two total strangers who ... accidentally had relatives that got married . 
yeah i guess ... sort of . 
hey look ! 
what 's he smoking ? 
that 's 'cause i was cursed with the sultenfuss bear claws .   my hands fit . 
my mother stood on this very spot . 
montgomery clift wait ' till i tell shelly . 
jerk ! you idiot ! ! ! 
leave me alone ! ! 
oh no ? ! ? ! ? ! 
in the tar ? ? 
what do you mean & quot;uh oh&quot ; ? ? ? 
don't ! ! ! 
don't come on ! ! ! 
just give it to me ! ! 
give it to me ! 
i want it back now . i never should have taken it off i want it back . 
do n't force it you 'll break it . 
ehh ... okay ... but be careful it has a lot of sentimental value . 
well i hope he 's not watching me all the time . 
well he was a boy he was my friend ... he was my best friend . when we were kids we were gonna ... move out here and move to the brady bunch . 
well it does n't open cans or anything but it ... it 's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine . 
this is n't just a mood ring . 
oh no wait i like that you bought me here . 
and i thought i was weird . 
at least it gives you plenty of exercise . 
he is one of the great poets . 
may i use the phone please . 
you would . 
this 'll be great in my report my mother was suspended for smoking . 
you ratted on my mother ? ? 
umm i 'm trying to find out her greatest achievement . 
why do you argue with everything i say ? 
i do n't think anybody should change their names that way you can always find them when you need them . 
change my name . 
i 'd never do that . 
it 's the leather bindings i love the fragrance of vintage books . 
look here she is . margaret ann muldovan - newspaper literary magazine french club drama club debate club girls basketball and swim team .   with maggie 's combo of good looks and talent we 're sure to be seeing her name in lights . she was gon na be famous . 
oh my gosh here it is ! 
what difference does it make ? 
just remember the needle in the haystack . 
what ? ? 
it 's not funny ! i mean what am i gon na do ? without that yearbook i 'm lost . i ca n't just walk around town looking for someone with a wilson high school letter sweater ! ! ! 
excuse me pardon thank you excuse me . 
well look i know that all you care about is your precious mini - bike . it 's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective i think we 're here . 
i was n't eavesdropping i was overhearing . 
i got it all figured out i know she went to wilson high school so first thing tomorrow i 'm gon na go there and get a copy of her yearbook . that way i can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were . 
my parents had a brief but intensely fulfilling relationship . she 's remained a woman of mystery to this day . 
i do n't need you to be telling me to ... 
he said it was a gift . 
dad already gave me this lecture . he 's gon na meet me at the airport then we 'll go for some pizza then we 'll have dinner in bed with shelly . 
i should do this myself . 
well i 've come this far ... the least i can do is knock on the door . 
a secret i like that . 
do you think i should tell my dad about jeffrey pommeroy ? 
i 'd like to see his house but ... i do n't know if i 'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door . i do n't think i can go through with it . 
i feel like before i can talk to him i have to see his face . 
do n't worry i 'll do it in my own subtle way . 
i had to be i only have five days . so just point me in the right direction and .... 
well then that 's not exactly dating is it . 
so does that mean that you sleep here every night ? 
sounds like you have a fear of commitment uncle phil . 
but ... are you engaged or something ? 
she lives here too ? 
he was very polite worth the entire five dollars . 
they 're great . 
bye aunt rose . 
yeah ... right it 's pointless to worry . 
shelly 's sick ... i have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there . 
not exactly . 
i 'm just tired . 
you 're nick 's mother ? 
let me hold him . 
did it hurt a lot ? 
he 's so tiny . 
but dad'll never go for it . 
yeah it would be kinda great . 
but what about you and the baby ? you need me . 
what do you mean ? 
i 'm definitely traveling some day . 
i wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere . 
is that why uncle phil moved there ? 
margaret 's my middle name but everybody called her maggie . los angeles have you ever been there ? 
this is one of my favorite things her passport . 
i do n't know dad does n't either . 
did she mention any contests that she won ? i mean she must have had some awards she was so talented and all . 
then grammoo said on christmas eve there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house . 
you 're telling me . 
why do they call them training bra 's ? it 's not like learning to ride a bike . 
when did you umm i mean umm ... 
is there milk in them already ? 
assuming the baby 's a & quot;supremes&quot ; fan . 
this is the street he walks down every day . when he needs inspiration ... 
well thanks for your help mr. rosenfeld and i 'm sorry my mother would n't go out with you i 'm sure she would have had a really great time . 
he 'll remember my mother for sure .   stanley it was a big class vada and ... but ... well of course he 'll remember who could forget maggie ? 
do you know him ? 
he 's a great poet . 
maybe he 's wet ? 
i was pushing as fast as i could . 
phil 's moving to la grammoo 's passing the baby being born vada 's report i think ... 
oh come on harry we 're talking about five days here . 
you 're being narrow - minded . 
she is not a child harry she is a young woman she 's on the brink of ... 
and some taco chips so i can dunk . 
never heard of him . 
yes i know it runs in the family .   new book ? 
listen if a boy wants to do homework with you it really means he did n't have nerve to ask you out on a date so you 'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying and the next thing you know you 're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars . 
look we react to every kick this baby gives maybe vada 's trying to tell us something too . 
i do n't know if i want to . 
then i 'll throw up a little bit . 
if i eat it i 'll throw up . 
you have no idea . 
i know look at his little hands . 
hey ! oh look . 
you leave your father to me . 
it would be fantastic . 
oh but i 'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so . 
how would you like to go visit your uncle phil in los angeles ... next week during your spring vacation you could do research on your mom . 
why not now ? 
well you 've got ta be prepared . 
uncle phil just needed a change a little adventure . 
no . you know they say that it never rains that you can barbecue on christmas day ... instead of riding your bike you just surf over to your friends house . oh and the place is just crawling with celebrities . i know someone who saw walter matthau picking up his dry - cleaning . 
oh vada she 's so beautiful . 
well it must mean something . she was obviously very sentimental . 
what 's this ? december 8th 1958 ? 
mmmmmm . root beer float that sounds good . 
oh no . 
i know i guess it 's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life . it 's not easy being a woman . 
oh i was a very late developer they used to call me & quot;shelly two backs&quot ; . all my friends had real bra 's not like the training ones i had . 
no the milk comes when the baby comes . 
they 're enormous i know . 
i bet your mom sang to you . 
i guess you have . 
well enrique is great and ... we are the best . 
what can i do for you ? 
you think this is easy for me ? you go out on the town and i get to be the bad guy . look i do n't want you to be some punk hoodlum delinquent but i ca n't do my job as a parent if you do n't do your job as a kid . 
make that sixty and i 'm docking your allowance for two weeks . 
you 're grounded ' till you 're fifty ! 
you 're so clever .

you like the way i cook ... you think i make out a great invoice .   phil you and nick and ... and this ... this garage are my whole life ... i love you . sure you do n't have the greatest taste in music ... but there 's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock . what i 'm try ... what i 'm trying to sa ... 
i think this place is just fine . 
i do n't want anything you do n't wanna give me . 
yes what kind of arrangement ? i 'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have . 
no that 's not a date a date is when i do n't cook .

weeping willow with your tears running down why do you always weep and frown is it because he left you one day is it because he could not stay on your branches he would swing do you long for the happiness that they would bring he found shelter in your shade he thought his laughter would never fade weeping willow stop your tears there is something to calm your fears you think death as if you forever part but i know he 'll always be in your heart .

stop hiding harry you run harry . when i first came here the idea of working with dead people did n't exactly thrill me but when i saw a family lived here i thought & quot;if i 'm living without a family at least i can work with one and maybe once in a while i 'll be invited in for supper.&quot ; 
open your eyes she 's eleven years old ! her only friend in the world is dead . 
i would never marry anybody i did n't love .

you can look in the bathroom if you want . people are always curious about that like what happens when you flush . 
i did it myself . i read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces . 
home sweet home . 
would you like to come in and see my house ? just for a minute . 
i had a good time tonight . 
you can be in a room with 100 men and not like any of them or you can be in a room with just one man and he 's exactly the one you want . 
kinda like men . 
oh i 'm just not lucky harry . 
i 'm gon na be putting makeup on some of these people very soon . 
i just had a terrible thought harry . 
does it make it easier to win ? 
i love going to movies especially at the drive in . i do n't think there 's anything more romantic than going to the drive in .   i 'll let you get back to work . 
you have to learn how to take a complement .   movies movies ahhhh & quot;love story&quot ; at the drive in i cried my eyes out did you see it ?

i should n't stick my nose in other people 's business . it 's just that i like vada very much . 
excuse me harry i 'm sorry i just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered . and the room 's all set up . 
harry i really think she ..... 
i do n't think so i think she 's confused about death . 
well the other night at dinner ... 
harry ?   i was just wondering if there is anything wrong with vada . 
i just wanted to get past this & quot;old school marm&quot ; image . 
i think she looks nice ! her lips are very thin so i used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality and her eyes just needed a little definition and her hair i 'm sorry nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972 . 
you do n't like it ? 
could you take a look at mrs. porter ? 
i promise i 'll take good care of these people they deserve it they 're dead all they 've got left is their looks . 
okay mr. sultenfuss you got a deal .

that was thursday . 
try less appropriate . 
i wish . 
i know that !   i was distracted by grief ! 
let 's not get carried away . 
beyond reason .   the feminist warrior will rise up in this kid and she 'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife selecting from a short list of body parts ! 
i am breaking her heart in the short run but doing her a gigantic favor ! she would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus ! 
i do n't know the meaning of the word guilt ! 
he was in love with me every day for nine years .   i can make him happier than she can . 
this is my whole life 's happiness . i have to be ruthless . 
there are 18250 nights in the next 50 years ... 
he takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit cuts his fingertip takes my hand does the same to me ... 
solid and genuine is not boring . michael can be completely insane ... 
he 's the salt of the earth .   kind and loyal and generous .   the one constant thing in my life is he 'll always be there . 
no he 's nothing like me .   he 's like you .   only straight . 
nine years we 've seen each other through everything .   losing jobs losing parents losing lovers ... travelled all over we 've had the best times .   the best times of my life maybe .   just drinking and talking .   even over a phone . 
no no the opposite .   that 's my best friend michael o'neal . he sounds desperate to talk . 
sometimes i do .   like for two months . 
is newsday a real interview or just some cute guy you 're setting me up w ... 
plus some guys whose food i do n't like . 
see the pull of a book like twenty chefs is not who i put in .   it 's who i leave out . 
is it sad to be an editor and bask only in reflected insincerity ? 
if your ass is n't chapped you are not a good - writer of note . 
i never want to go through this again . 
have you ever heard of . irony ? 
in one minute .   you are going to feel so foolish . 
yeah well lots of couples are imcompat ...

in six months he 'll be happy settled successful ... 
only .   if he wants to . 
what you said .   make it appear that he 's doing you the favor . 
gold nose hair clippers . 
... whatever is manly and independent . 
bad games bad towns bad pay bad flights bad hotels real bad food . homeless rootless lonely maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four ... 
probably am .   forget i brought it up .

jesus we 're trapped ! 
i 've missed a step . 
i was gon na predict that . 
well perfection can get wearing after whi ... 
do you get hysterical in small confined spa ... 
let me rephrase that ... 
do you get nervous in small confined spaces ? 
it 's been awhile .   i 'll take your word . 
a trademark move do n't touch it . 
how about ... 
well .   you 've been introduced to the symphonic range of ... 
... garden sports all .   little swing of maybe fifty degrees fahrenheit represents a packing challenge but there 's fine food and cocktails at a choice of embassy suit ... 
so your honeymoon is exactly where ? 
... most sentimental schmucks i pity want a honeymoon after their wedding .   just to top it off . 
... luckiest guy in the northern fucking hemisphere is all i 'm s ... 
do n't you have to be somewh ... 
that 's why michael and i were the wrong fit .   right from the start . 
what else did he tell you ... 
i thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress . 
which was the disqualifying factor ? 
uh .   how about promoting a bridesmaid ?   someone you know for at least forty - five minutes . 
... you want a menage on your wedding night . 
can you watch the road ? 
excuse me ? 
you need a few dollars .

i saw the show . 
right .   and then it did n't want to come off .   exactly . 
well .   see .   that was a ... reflex to see if it would ... 
... unless he has a hump . 
i need to make some calls . could i use ... your office ? 
nobody has .   so far . 
i told him get the important stuff kim 's ring .   i 'll collect the inconsequentials . 
then it could all come out sooner or later .   nobody should be in on this .   just you and me .   or more correctly i. 
he 's too proud to beg for help . and if you wait till this comes out your offer will be like charity . completely humiliating . 
he 's said some things over the past few weeks .   look this is why i came up with the idea of you offering him a job . 
i think he 's been fired . 
it 's a fax from sports illustrated from ben isaacson michael 's boss . 
sir this is important ! have n't you ever in your life cut one corner to make something important turn out right ? 
is anybody watching ? 
i think you 're making a mistake sir . 
nice meeting you too walt . 
i guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question . 
... me yeah .   and she likes tommy lasorda .   case closed . 
okay we 'll split up .   you go to every romantic place you guys have i 'll go ... someplace brilliant and the first one who ... 
that 's little egotistical . 
course if it 's later rather than sooner i 'd hate to be you at six o'clock .   you 've got a lot of explaining to ... 
you ca n't believe you 've lost her !   sooner or later you 'll find her and you 'll look in each other 's eyes and you 'll see all that love ... 
that is so romantic . 
it 's two weeks . 
why would she come here ... 
i 'm so glad you did n't jump on that train before ... 
actually .   lower .   i am the fungus that feeds on pond scum .   lower . the layer of mucous that cruds up the fung ... 
i did n't know it would get sent .   i just wanted you to ... get mad at kimmy ... and ... 
... wrote it yeah .   i 'm the bad guy . 
don't speak ! 
this is the dumbest thing i will ever do .   so dumb in fact that i ca n't .   i do n't think . 
the big hurt huh ? 
you never want to do that see that 's always a ... costly turnover .   as they say in the sport biz . 
... your one chance for true happiness ? 
well it happens . 
oh yeah . 
does that make it right ... 
she admits it 's her fault . 
because she 's as chickenshit as you are you morons are made for each other . 
and your point ? 
get married apparently . 
but the scotch salmon was so fucking good you decided to stay for brunch ! 
i had the craziest dream last night ?   walter and kimmy had asked your boss to ... 
if san antonio sweeps sacramento ... 
should we take a walk ?   or maybe some food sent up or something ... 
maybe tomorrow you 'll feel dif ... 
a bad combination . 
what happened ? 
michael ? what ha ... 
... maybe it 's congratulations . 
it means a lot . 
you 're right .   easy come easy go . 
we could use ... his computer to ... just e - mail those suckers right ou ... 
it 's just ... up there ... right in front of walter 's ... y'know computer . if memory serves . 
that 's my point ! ! 
i 'm up against a deadline . 
isn't there a guard ?   a janitor ? a fucking cleaning woman ? i'll take a burglar !   somebody 's gotta be in th ... 
no accents today . 
we danced to it .   just like this . 
the night we met . 
i 'll check .   i have it on powerbook these days . 
i would n't know .   i never had that many first thoughts . 
me either . 
except for the hot affairs we 'll have twice a year . 
you 've been the man in mine . 
well .   there 's a lot of memories to choose from ... 
have you . 
if you like . 
you miss her huh ? 
well you 've got the rest of your lives . 
you keep saying that . 
like i said dazzling . 
michael it sounds like a wonderful opportun ... 
waiter ! check please ! 
is there a coup de grace in here somewh ... 
quite the little eccentric . 
endearingly absent - minded . 
what 's next ? 
hate that . 
such as . 
i just admire your maturity that 's all .   i mean there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring .   day after day year after year ... 
best everything joe .   but i 'm going to dance with you . 
what 's the sec ... 
well maybe we should talk ab ... 
... thomas yeh . 
michael it 's wednesday night you ca n't possibly be getting married on su ... 
you 've met her parents . 
well sure . 
well somet ... 
well that 's great .   you have n't really had anybody since dingbat jennylee ... 
yeh well my old machine kept eating messages .   i tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement but finally ... 
that 's entirely understandable . 
why don't you just drive a stake through my heart ? 
i love him . 
... that this is all my fault ? 
do n't you see ... 
this must be ... very very hard on him . 
look at all this beautiful food so lovingly prepared ... 
we settled this .   and i reneged . that was n't fair . 
i just do n't want to freak him out . 
he wo n't get mad huh ? 
he 'll see right through it . 
exactly what ? 
so ... one almost has to ... 
gold dog collars ? they do n't have dogs . 
for the twins ? what in the world is th ... 
but he always says ... 
i mean he loves his job . 
i just think you 're wrong is all . 
about michael 's job . 
stop we 're embarrassing h ... 
it 's not just clubs .   this guy always knows the best everything . the best guitar store the best beef ribs the best horowitz record was he always like the ... 
he has you on a pedestal .   and me in his arms . 
you 're enshrined in his heart and memory .   unassailable . which works out great . 
you win . 
and the answer was so simple . 
i 'm not joking .   i had to face up to all my competitive drives and believe me i 've got 'em . 
you 'll always be there .   in his mind .   the perfect creature he loved for all those y ... 
... except one . 
but nothing ever could ever did give me a moment 's pause about this marriage ... 
so it 's sweet of you to be protective ... 
and loving him means loving all of this . 
after two weeks of cataloguing all his faults i made a command decision that changed my life . 
but he sure can kiss . 
he sucks soup through his front teeth . 
... cigars in bed ? i broke him on that .   but the bathroom 's a swamp he wears reeboks to dinner tells the same admittedly funny jokes three hundred times ... 
... his snoring yeah .   he says it 's worse than ever .   that snaffle one ... ? 
it depends .   if san antonio sweeps sacramento we could start there . or phoenix .   or depending on indiana- clevel ... 
i 'm excited sports illustrated gave him this kind of shot he 's only there a ye ... 
what ? because i 'm a little understand ... 
... just my bridal shower .   and michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at comiskey for a one - thirty game . 
he said that too . 
... you hate weddings you never go . 
not you .   you wo n't be comfortable unless you 're distinctive . 
the twin part .   i like to remain impartial in my contempt . 
the bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty . identical twin debutantes from nashville who are basically vengeful sluts .   with amazing bodies ! 
you ca n't believe what it 'd cost to bring in a temp . 
this is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav ... 
see .   dry .   it 's in the delivery . 
but i ca n't be dry . 
i can be quick .   i can even be funny . 
my heart 's in my throat here . right off i have to ask this monstrous favor ... 
i think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you . 
all i 've heard from the day i met michael is julianne this and julianne that ... 
michael ! ! 
well if that 's the way you f ... 
what is that sup ... 
all of a sudden i 'm supposed to drop out of school forget my family forget my career forget all the plans i had for my life ... 
and to m ... 
it would only be maybe six months ? or three or four ? it would mean so much to him ... 
he needs someone incredible someone really close who he can trust ... 
... and public relations is a big problem area for him . 
no it 's uh ... a real big favor . 
to the twins ' soiree ?   so they can paw you and drool ... ? 
the most important thing . is being together . 
well the school will be here . architecture will still be around . right now ... 
no those are socials you 're thinking of ... saturday 's usually . 
we have a bible study meeting tonight if you 'd like to come . 
you 're from out of town ? 
he 's a member of our congregation . 
no mostly his wife 's . she 's in paris france right now . my husband delbert is real friendly with him . delbert 's in law . does work for him . 
no i do n't . 
just my church and my boys . we all had to go to school and learn hand talking . i just thank the lord they can see . 
about three years . 
it just is . 
yes it is -- 
when i was little in church . 
yes -- yes they have . it was a real shock at first especially since my daddy 's a preacher but delbert and i have been blessed by their being here . 
that 's what you said before . 
that 's unkind . 
i 'm not sure . 
i ca n't . 
i have to go . he sighs . 
i have to go . 
does n't it have a name ? 
i do n't know who you are .

i 'm sorry but i have to go .

your hair fell out ? just like your father . weak hair . 
weather 's been awful . all those bombs dropping . it changes our weather . sure not like the good old days . 
well you 'll get it skin as sensitive as yours . 
he doesn1 t have fungus does he ? 
worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus . 
bet the sheets are grey . 
green ?   not owen green . owen green embezzled money from your grandfather 
how are you going to pay when you get sick ? 
next you 'll be sick . 
oh well i knew that before you- even left . i told you ' kenny that old nash wo n't make it down the road . '   but you had to go . 
oh ... well . 
i 've been so worried dear . where are you ? 
you 're not a man because of a job duff . 
i do n't think that 'll happen . 
where 're you going to go ? 
there 's nothing to say . 
duff i love you . 
what d'you mean ? 
not if you see them for what they are duff . 
just of getting hurt . they ca n't touch me inside . 
i do n't know . i guess i 'm not afraid of them . 
i ca n't stand to see you like that . i know you ca n't help it . 
do n't do that ! 
what 're you going to do ? 
day work . 
i could work even after the baby comes . a few hours a week anyway . 
i 'm trying to help duff . 
you know - we do have enough money . especially now . 
you can have what i 've got . it 's right there . 
about ten dollars . 
we can always do that duff . 
they wo n't . 
you will . 
do n't deny me duff . 
do n't duff . 
i keep thinking about him . 
what about your boy ? 
we 'll be all right . 
well i have n't come around . 
do n't look so scared . 
how would you like to have a baby duff ? 
my father 's never done a thing for any of them . 
i do n't want to hurt you . 
my kids want me to teach them . 
you know how to box ? 
you still did n't answer my question . 
you did n't answer my question . 
am i as good as they ? 
duff - you know those women you used to know-- 
oh really ? i thought it was pretty good . 
what 's wrong ? 
yeah that 's so . 
he could live with us . 
do n't call them that . 
that 's bessie hall . barney works at the mill . 
it 'll be fine when we get done with it . 
well what d'you think ? 
no . but a small one . 
what about that girl ? 
do n't push me duff . 
what happened duff ? 
thank you . 
what d'you mean ? 
i 'll have some coffee please . 
your boy . 
how did it go ?

that 's right . 
i 'm just going in to do my shopping . 
are you married ? 
i did n't know you had one . 
just for the day ? 
look duff - if you 're free i 'm not working tomorrow . 
what d'you mean ? 
that 's the way he is . 
' been up north ? 
why did you ? 
good night duff . 
look duff - most of the men i know - they 're kind of sad . when i met you the other day i had a feeling that you 're different . that 's why i went out with you . i thought we might have something to say to each other . 
you have some very primitive ideas do n't you ? 
no on the porch . 
i would n't have let you . 
what d'you mean ? 
but i would like to see you again . 
not here duff . 
it 's better than it used to be . eight years ago they still had a lynching here . they tied a man to a car and dragged him to death . my father knew who did it but he did n't say anything . 
it 's hard to see any change . but i 'm going to stay . another year anyway . 
well my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had . nobody bothers with those kids . 
let 's go duff . 
do n't duff-- 
well let 's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty - eight times . 
i see . that beer made me dizzy . 
how d'you mean ? 
i mean you 're kind of cut off are n't you ? 
i guess it 's hard working on the road like that . 
well they seem just like everyone else . 
they must work on the section gang . 
what is it ? 
no thanks . 
i like a place with lots of life . 
you keep asking me why i 'm here . 
you do n't think much of yourself do you ? 
how d'you mean ? 
what d'you expect ? 
that 's right . 
my father 's the preacher . 
yes are n't you ? 
your folks live there ? 
in birmingham . 
i 'm a teacher . 
oh yeah ? 
you working ? 
have n't seen you around have i ? 
you must be new in town . 
good - bye duff . 
i know he was n't much of a father . 
do n't be too hard on him . 
no thanks . i 'll take the bus . 
how ' you gon na live ? 
they 'll run you out . 
going back huh ? 
well what 're you going to do ? 
it 's just that i hate empty rooms . 
want to come up the house ? you can stay there till you get on your feet . there 's no point paying a hotel . 
nothing you can do . been like this for days . 
come back some other time will you ? 
he 's been hitting it pretty hard . got high blood pressure too . i guess it 's hard on him having you around . 
whenever he 's got an edge on . 
let 's go .

no . i only needed the code from you . 
they 're a bit too real for my taste . will you excuse me for a moment ? 
let me get you another glass of wine . 
oh my god i 'm terribly sorry . did i hurt you ? 
how 's the villa 's security ? 
we did a pretty good job of pissing them off . 
a little incestuous but at least it 's original . who 's the guy in the halloween costume ? 
what 's an a.i. 
hold on . 
you 're out of time man . 
what is it ? 
my god ... these people are insane . 
we 've still got to find the mainframe . 
... and if i guess wrong ? 
sure ... maelcom 's a rude boy right maelcom ? 
when they did my eyes i made them promise i 'd still be able to cry . sounds stupid does n't it ? 
once i kicked i swore i would n't let that happen again . i apprenticed a razor girl in osaka . went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up . been taking care of myself just fine ever since . 
i know .

we 'll find out soon enough . if you do n't pull the splices out . 
almost two days . 
hey ... you 're not supposed to be up . 
you 've been calling her name . 
what 's that supposed to mean ? 
i know who he is n't . not c.i.a. not sense / net . but ... money comes in . doors open . he 's onto something . 
for someone else . bodyguard . courier ... whatever . 
couple of months . 
since armitage sold them a program on it . put them years ahead of the competition . 
sorry . that 's not gon na happen . 
what is it ? 
you want to hear the pitch you got ta meet the man . 
because you 've exceeded your shelf life case . word on the street is you 're a dead man walking . nice time for an employment opportunity . travel to exotic locales .

anita when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you did n't think you could learn spanish fast enough who quizzed you on your verbs ? 
okay just so i 'm clear here -- neither of you think i can do this . 
you do n't think i can do it . 
i 've kissed guys . i 've just never kissed a guy . felt that thing-- 
when i finally get kissed i 'll know . 
the right guy is out there . i 'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him . 
i 'm concentrating on my career right now .

wow . that 's big . i mean sex is a really big deal . you should n't do it until you know you 've found the right person . 
maybe because we 're not supposed to be having sex with bananas . 
was n't even thinking about- 
rob -- thanks . for everything . this is really happening . i never thought-- 
thanks . and what are - 
she 's sixteen years old rob . that 's totally and completely illegal .

you 're twenty - three years old ! 
are you crazy ? ! you ca n't do this . 
i 've been in a horrible accident . this is a coma - induced nightmare . 
better than i ... 
yes desperately . 
is that true ? 
do n't you realize how much i wanted to be you in high school ? just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular ? 
rob . please focus . 
rob you do n't know how it was for me back in high school . no one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway . you never dreamed about being popular- you already were . all i wanted was to be accepted and they just fucking tortured me . i ca n't do all that again . i ca n't go back to southglen south . 
gus insists that i become friends with these kids . the popular kids . it 's impossible . 
i ca n't do this . 
are mom and dad here ? 
nauseated . i look nauseated . oh god . 
josie grossie .

for your information i am very happy . deliriously happy . i lead a very happy life ! 
how can you just give up like that ? you had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything . do n't you want more ? to move out of mom and dad 's ? pay your own bills ? 
this -- this is a luau that sells packing material ! 
i know this woman . she works in admissions at lakeshore community ? she might be able to get you in for the fall semester . maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship and i could help and-- 
better person than i. 
rob take the money okay ? it 's no big deal . 
because i bought the windshield last week . i 'm a hubcap away from owning more of bambi than you do . 
okaaaay ....   that car 's going to bankrupt you . 
that is so -- weird that you name your car . 
i finally found my story . 
please . please do n't walk away . 
i do n't ! look you could get to know me again . 
i did exist . i do exist . i 'm the same person ! 
but now you do n't have to--

when are you going to open your eyes ? 
you have to say that . you 're my teacher . 
that 's okay . it 's nice to have someone to talk to-- 
why do you do that ? 
i know . 
i do n't have to say that . 
you do . seem to . have passion . in the classroom . 
that 's what makes you interesting .   as a teacher . 
do n't look down ! 
of course . i remember everything from your class . 
oh right . the spiderman incident . 
you 're afraid of the ferris wheel . 
are you -- scared ? 
thank you . 
thanks . wow . that's -- really nice to hear . 
oh no no no no no . see my family we do n't go to college .   we just go right into sheep herding . 
college . have n't really thought about it . 
thank you . 
oh i do n't think so . 
well i 'm definitely seventeen and   now definitely late-- 
sure why ? 
but i think she wanted to be happy that 's why she wrote . i mean she was still writing about love right ? 
i love the way she writes . 
sorry . forgetful . 
i 'm josie . geller . i think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling me that . josie . 
the poem ! i knew he liked the poem !   billy prince is asking me to the prom . 
it 's romantic what you 're doing and they want to be a part of it .

yes it 's lame . 
are you kidding josie ? it 's lame . all they do is stand around and get drunk . it 's lame . 
i mean what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they 're actually brainiacs with super powers and they 're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until i die ? 
sometimes i wonder what they talk about . 
this one has been so hyped . we 're tied for most wins with northglen north . this year 's winner will determine the winner of the century . the theme is everything . so whatever southglen picks has to be totally unique-- 
southglen south competes every year for best prom and usually they win . we denominators do n't even go to prom . -but to everyone else it 's huge . 
how would you like to join the denominators ? the math team could really use a new brain . we lost our best logarithm guy last year . 
hey josie how are you at calculus ? 
sure . no problem . 
just so you know i think they recalled these cars in 1974 . 
professor of medieval literature . novelist . weekend flautist . 
i 'm going to be so happy to get to college . i hear at northwestern they do n't make fun of you for knowing the element table . 
yeah - is n't it amazing that those guys are our same age ? i mean they just seem so much younger you know . 
: because he 's guy perkins .   listen you want to walk to na- na 's and get something to eat ? 
until guy tells them to go . once they watched me for like two hours . i found my car the next day in the t.j. maxx parking lot . 
well do you ? 
guess . although what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now- 
when it 's not yours . my mom was going through her harlequin romance phase . 
guy perkins and his amazing lemmings . they push your car out of its space hide it then watch while you look for it . we 've taken to chaining ours together for safety . i 'm aldys . 
listen i do n't have any plans-- you want some help ? 
you should go out every now and then gus ; with some new ties the girls would be all over you . 
oh give it up gus . i 'm just making conversation . 
gus have you ever been in love ? 
you knit ? 
oh man ! who told ? 
well excuse me . 
right . right . 
i had a lunch break so i thought i 'd come by and see you . your teacher is a fox !   why do n't we discuss that after class . but the burning is totally normal .   oh look . class is over already . 
if you say so . 
well . i like a man who gets to the point .

so i was thinking about what you were saying - y'know about really being kissed ? i think roger could be the one . 
now this is cute . 
mama mia .   just because you were a nerd once does n't mean it 's going to happen again . that 's why you have me for fashion consultation . 
okay . that 's bad . 
please . that does n't make you a nerd . everyone wore those shoes . 
so you were a geek . big deal . 
senorita josie . 
jos that 's not what we 're -- 
no - it 's just a lot of pressure for your first piece that 's all . i mean it 's not a half - page article it 's a major undercover piece jos . look what rigfort did to dutton - and that guy 's his cousin ! 
jos - maybe you should turn it down . 
okay . if you 've never kissed a guy we got bigger problems than the underwear . 
yeah but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion . 
look . you 're way under 30 you 're cute some guys find white carter 's underwear sexy   if you talk to his nose you do n't even notice the eye . 
do you own any colored underwear ? stripes ? anything ? ! 
i swear to god jos . when is the last time you went on a real live date ? 
you stood for like a month . 
okay . remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it ? 
and what is your policy ? that if you 're not getting any no one can ? 
well that does n't mean it was going to happen for sure . 
who told ! 
guess who i did it with last night ... 
when he left he took a lot of equipment with him . 
he stayed a long time . 
ca n't you make other creations ? 
but i have to go out . something 's happening out there . 
i 'm not hungry .   what 's wrong ?   i spent all morning on that soup .   i thought you liked worm 's wart . 
but why ?   it 's < u > your</u > lunch . there is n't much there in the first place . 
nothing .   w - w - what are you talking about ? 
just me i suppose ...   i 'm restless .   i ca n't help it . 
that 's not true .   it 's a beautiful home wonderfully comfortable ... i 'm indebted to you for everything ... it 's just ... 
i know . 
i ca n't help it . 
i 'm grown up now .   i have to leave some time . 
i know . 
he ca n't hold you jesse .   he 's losing his grip - you can get out . 
i love you jesse .   come back to me . 
i 'm not afraid of you .   you could n't kill me ... he 's in there and i want him back .   i 'm gon na take him away from you and you 're going straight back to hell you son - of - a - bitch ! 
i want him back .   jesse talk to me . jesse ! 
where 's jesse ? 
oh god jesse - i know you 're there ! stop him ! 
jesse help ! 
we must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans ' hospital . 
you created him - you can destroy him . he lives off your fear .   fight him jesse ! 
no jesse .   this is n't happening . it 's got ta be everything you 've taken in -- schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it 's all mixed up . 
who ?   who 's doing this to you ? 
who jesse ? 
oh christ you 're hurt ... 
jesse god - what happened ? 
we 'll figure it out together .   we 'll stay up all night if we have to .   i wo n't let anything happen to you . 
you 're not being fair to me .   i 'm worried about you and i want to help you get through this thing . 
why wo n't you talk to me ? 
i wish you 'd talk to me .   we can figure it out you know .   we can figure it out together . 
you should eat something - you 'll feel better . 
you want to talk about it ? 
you did n't say more than two words to me the whole way here .   you had another nightmare did n't you ? 
will you stop and tell me what 's wrong ? 
oh jesse ... 
what is it ? 
what is it - what 's wrong ? 
ghostbusters are fearless . 
maybe we can do that .   strictly scientific of course . 
maybe it only happens when you 're sleeping - that 's the way it was with nancy was n't it ? 
i 'll get over it . 
about what ? 
shhh .   just concentrate . 
i do n't know .   concentrate or some- thing . 
c'm on cut it out . 
i thought you might be able to make a connection . 
so you feeling anything ? 
remember in the diary - nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room ?   fred krueger worked here .   it 's an old power- plant - a steam generator ! 
it 's a surprise . 
make a left at this corner . 
and heat and chemical reactions . where does it all go when you die ? 
look you got electricity in your body right ? 
you do n't have to .   you just have to believe in energy . 
research .   hi .   c'm on let 's go for a ride . 
i just got here myself .   went to the public library .   cut four classes ! 
i do n't know . 
this is amazing !   your dream told you where this was ? 
world history .   but i 'll see you in the morning right ? 
are you okay . 
i think it 's sad ... 
uh - uh .   before my time . 
i figured you might like some help . 
i know . 
you mean a shithead . 
you should n't be fighting with that jerk . 
let me look at your eye ... 
you okay ? 
that 's okay i wanted to . 
are n't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that ? 
how come ? 
mom 's trying to keep him upstairs . 
all of them . 
hi kerry . 
thanks mom . 
you 're going out ? 
what 's that ? 
okay ... thanks . 
i 'll get it .   please i do n't mind . 
i 'll need to take her things . 
i 'm sure you would . 
just some answers .   there are other kids involved its not just kristen .   all good kids smark kids . 
i 'm serious . 
did she always have nightmares ? 
mrs. parker was kristen acting different ? did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt ? 
kincaid -- we should find the others first ... 
you did n't think we 'd let you go alone ? 
last time it was me against him .   i was n't strong enough ... alone . 
he wears a dirty brown hat .   he 's horribly burned .   he has razors on his right hand . 
i know who 's trying to kill you . 
no she 's right . 
i 'm so proud of you all .   tell neil i ... 
i think so . 
let 's try this way . 
kristen can you pull us out ? 
he 's too strong !   he was never this strong ! 
i do n't know . 
how do we find him kristen ? 
you never lose a gift like that .   you just forget how to use it .   how about it ?   will you try ? 
you did it the other night . 
we 're not always as good at things as we 'd like . 
you like gymnastics ? 
he 's real . 
it 's an amazing gift . 
have you ever done that before ?   pulled someone into your dream ? 
i used to live in this house . 
you pulled me in somehow did n't you ? 
thank you . 
it 'll be my last chance .   pleese ? 
but max she needs me .   it could mean life or death . 
thanks max . 
i just wanted to be here for the kids . how are they ? 
max where 's kristen ? 
why is that ? 
a little basic but nice . 
crossed over ? 
it 's over .   it 's over . 
people are still dying .   after all this time .   stop running away from it .   daddy please ... don't make me beg .   you owe me . 
i think we can stop him this time . stop him for good .   but we need to know where the bones were hidden . 
you know what he did .   he 's doing it again . 
that 's not true .   you 're the one who 's trying to forget . 
it 's been a long time . 
neil it 's no use .   you saw how he is . 
i 'll be okay .   just give me a minute . 
there 's only one man ... and its time for him to talk . 
they burned him to death in his boiler room but they were smart enough to hide the remains . 
all right .   whoever she is i 'll admit she seems to know more about krueger than i do . 
assuming your mysterious nun in right . 
do n't you think i know that ?   i do n't have any choice . 
what are we going to do ? 
take it slowly .   remember this is a dream . anything is possible . 
we made it .   neil we made it ! 
we can try again . 
take us there kristen . 
remember -- open mind . 
only if you 're willing to put aside everything you 've learned and trust me . can you do that ? 
the truth . 
then maybe you 're ready . 
stop blaming yourself . 
c'm on .   let 's get out of this rain . 
to who ? 
do you think we can get the hypnocyl in by tomorrow ? 
do you ?   you told me they 're survivors ... and they are .   but how much longer they survive is up to us . 
i used to be like them neil .   i know what they 're going through . 
just until we get things under control . 
that 's right . 
all right .   then let 's eliminate the symptom for the time being . 
that 's what i know . 
what if i told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams ? 
i 'm serious . 
it was .   neil do you believe in other realities ? 
my father an i ... well the family just seemed to fall apart . 
my mother 's dead .   died in her sleep . 
must have opened while i was away at school . 
this is nice . 
all i can say is this is n't something that 's just going to disappear .   you 're all going to have to face it .   fight it . and if you 're willing to work together ... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears ... i think we can beat it . 
did n't get much sleep . 
just something children sing ... to keep the boogeyman away . 
call me nancy . 
call it a passion .   i 've got to get going . 
i 've had some experience with pattern nightmares . 
i would n't be so sure they have n't . 
oh god . 
but nightmares are the common thread ? 
tell me about the kids . 
we ca n't get to her .   i 've tried . 
okay straight talk only in here . 
sshhh .   no time for that .   come on . 
freddy krueger .   he was a child murderer before he died .   after he died he became ... something worse .   six years ago freddy killed my friends . he almost killed me .   i thought i got rid of him -- but i guess he was too strong . 
your dreams ? 
neil please -- 
you ca n't !   they 'll be defenseless against their dreams . 
and what are they ? 
please mom ?   i just do n't want to be alone . 
can we talk ?   just for a minute ? 
i had such an awful dream . 
i thought i 'd wait for you . 
and you do n't want to keep him waiting . 
he 's full of shit . 
it 's okay i 'm not tired .   really . 
i thought i 'd wait for you . 
hi mom . 
do you still ... see each other ? 
to old friends . 
i do n't know .   i 'm busy with school . new friends .   but i 'll never forget the old ones . 
i think new york was just what i needed .   so many people .   i never feel alone . 
he 's close ... 
he 's gone .   it 's over .   please do n't die nancy .   please . 
are you okay ? 
they sedated me .   we 're stuck here till it wears off . 
what 's that ? 
joey needs us .   i can feel him . 
he 's heavy in the halls ... 
that was different . 
i have n't been able to do that since i was a little girl . 
yeah but i was really not good . 
i was on the team at school .   i was never very good though . 
nancy ?   would you sit with me awhile ? 
that man in my dreams .   he 's real is n't he ? 
when i was still a kid .   my folks got divorced .   after a while i thought i 'd imagined the whole thing .   i guess i did n't . 
when i was a little girl .   three or four . if i had a nightmare i 'd bring my dad in . the dream would always get better .   he always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams . nancy when did it stop ? 
but ... it 's just a house i 've dreamed about .   i dream about it all the time .   thank you for what you did last night . 
i -- i think so ! 
lovely to meet you . 
i 'm a vegetarian . 
i wonder if you could tell me where the ... ? 
night night honey . 
you 're right .   i told you i was bad at acting . 
and may i say that 's a gorgeous tie . 
that was such a great evening . 
well ... a shot at it . 
wait a minute .   what about me ? 
oh ... no one ... no one .   just some ... guy from the past .   i do n't know what he 's doing here .   bit of an awkward situation . 
and then i ... right . 
so i ask you when you 're going to tell everyone and you say ... ? 
i said i 'm not listening -- and i think looking at something that firm you and your droopy little excuse for an ' arse ' would be well - advised to keep quiet . 
i 'm not listening . 
we have to .   i 've got to be in new york on thursday . 
fifteen million dollars . 
films mainly . 
well they can be . 
i 'm an actress . 
yes i 'm pretty sure i would . 
i hoped there might be -- but no i 'm assured there are n't . 
okay .   fine .   fine .   good decision . 
i see .   that reality is a real ' no ' is n't it ? 
... yes that 's fine .   of course .   i ... you know ... of course ... i 'll just ... be getting along then ... nice to see you . 
that 's fine .   there 's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict . 
you expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in england ? 
yes .   the thing is ... i have to go away today but i wondered if i did n't whether you might let me see you a bit ... or a lot maybe ... see if you could ... like me again . 
i actually had it in my apartment in new york and just thought you 'd ... but when it came to it i did n't know how to call you ... having behaved so ... badly twice .   so it 's been just sitting in the hotel .   but then ... you came so i figured ... the thing is ... the thing is ... 
no do n't open it yet -- i 'll be embarrassed . 
i thought i 'd give it to you . 
oh no .   it 's all nonsense believe me . i had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is ...   well yesterday was our last day filming and so i 'm just off -- but i brought you this from home and ... 
well ... how have you been ? 
you disappeared . 
drink tea -- there 's lots of tea . 
but ... wait ... there are things to say . 
it 's not going very well -- and it 's our last day . 
i was going to ring ... but ... i did n't think you 'd want to ... 
this is certainly ... ah ... 
you really do n't get it .   this story gets filed .   every time anyone writes anything about me -- they 'll dig up these photos .   newspapers last forever . i 'll regret this forever . 
excuse me ? 
you 're right : of course you 're right . it 's just that i 've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you 've had it for ten minutes .   our perspectives are different . 
and remember -- spike owes you an expensive dinner .   or holiday -- depending if he 's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal . 
i do n't want a goddamn cup of tea .   i want to go home . 
who knows it may even help business . buy a boring book about egypt from the guy who screwed anna scott . 
you can stay calm -- it 's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input maximum publicity .   everyone you ever bump into will know .   ' well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we 've seen the pictures . ' 
as far as they 're concerned i do .   and now tomorrow there 'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to timbuktu . 
this is such a mess .   i come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now i 'm landed in it all over again .   for god 's sake i 've got a boyfriend . 
really ?   the entire british press just woke up this morning and thought ' hey -- i know where anna scott is .   she 's in that house with the blue door in notting hill . '   and then you go out in your goddamn underwear . 
i do .   your furry friend thought he 'd make a buck or two telling the papers where i was . 
how do you think i 'm doing ? 
oh my god .   and they got a photo of you dressed like that ? 
damn i forgot the jam . 
can i stay a bit longer ? 
her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they did n't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me ? 
rita hayworth used to say -- ' they go to bed with gilda -- they wake up with me . ' do you feel that ? 
but ... they 're odd - looking .   they 're for milk .   your mum 's got them .   you must have seen a thousand of them -- what 's the fuss about ? 
no seriously .   i mean they 're just breasts .   every second person in the world has got them ... 
what is it about men and nudity ? particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them ? 
you and every person in this country . 
today has ben a good day .   which under the circumstances is ... unexpected . 
actually mel does his own ass work . why would n't he ?   it 's delicious . 
definitely .   ths is important stuff . 
i could have a stunt bottom yes . 
definitely .   ' you may show the dent at the top of the artist 's buttocks -- but neither cheek .   in the event of a stunt person being used the artist must have full consultation . ' 
the thing that 's so irritating is that now i 'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses . 
big feet -- large shoes . 
you know what they say about men with big feet ? 
you 've got big feet . 
yes -- happiness would n't be happiness without a violin - playing goat . 
i do .   it feels like how being in love should be .   floating through a dark blue sky . 
yes -- i mean -- you never get anyone in ' wings of a dove ' having the nerve to say ' inform the pentagon that we need black star cover . ' 
you think i should do henry james instead ? 
what do you think ? 
well get a message through to him too . 
my son 's name is johnny ? 
' cartwright wainwright whatever your name is i promised little jimmy i 'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that i may be a little late . ' 
damn .   ' and wainwright ... ' 
' thank you . '   how many mistake did i make ? 
' no turn over 4 trs 's and tell them we need radar feedback before the kft 's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the pentagon that we 'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15 ' -- and do n't you dare say one word about how many mistakes i made in that speech or i 'll pelt you with olives . 
i 'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster . 
would you ?   it 's all talk talk talk . 
yes -- start in l.a. on tuesday . 
just anytime i 've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it 's been a disaster . 
i have thought about you . 
i do n't know .   it got to the point where i could n't remember any of the reasons i loved him .   and you ... and love ? 
i 'm really sorry about last time .   he just flew in -- i had no idea -- in fact i had no idea if he 'd ever fly in again . 
a bath would be great . 
these are such horrible pictures . they 're so grainy ... they make me look like ... 
thank you .   i 'm just in london for two days -- but with your papers it 's the worse place to be . 
i do n't know where to go .   the hotel is surrounded . 
hi .   can i come in ? 
i 'm sorry ... i do n't know what to say . 
because my boyfriend who i thought was in america is in fact in the next room . 
you 've got to go . 
there are lots of reasons .   do you want to come up ? 
here we are .   do you want to come up ? 
i do n't know either . 
i 'm rash and i 'm stupid and what am i doing with you ? 
i should n't have done that .   i should n't have done that . 
no that 's fine .   i love that you tried ... time was i 'd have done the same . 
uh - oh .   that 's not good . 
so who left who ? 
step aside . 
you said ' whoopsidaisies . ' 
yes you did . 
what did you say ? 
you abide by rules like that ? 
let 's go in . 
i was . 
busy tomorrow ? 
too complicated . 
and the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident ? 
why is she in a wheelchair ? 
floppy huh ? 
well i 've been on a diet since i was nineteen which means basically i 've been hungry for a decade .   i 've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me : and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment . meantime it cost millions to get me looking like this ... 
if that 's all right . 
no i mean if it 's fine with you i 'll you know be your date . 
okay -- fine . 
ahm .   that thing i was doing tonight -- i 'm not doing it any more .   i told them i had to spend the evening with britain 's premier equestrian journalist . 
well it was nice to meet you . surreal but nice . 
and what happens next in the dream ? 
no it 's my fault i thought this would all be over by now .   i just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing .   i seriously do n't know what got in to me .   i just wanted to make sure you were fine about it . 
ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult obviously being set in space . 
no it 's a stupid privacy thing .   i always choose a cartoon character -- last time out i was mrs. bambi . 
yeh -- unfortunately things are going to be pretty busy but ... okay let 's give it a try .   four o'clock could be good . 
oh -- okay . 
you played it pretty cool here waiting for three days to call . 
probably best not tell anyone about this . 
do n't worry about it .   i thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint . 
thanks .   well ... 
i forgot my bag . 
thank you . 
no .   i better be going .   thanks for your help . 
really no . 
no thanks . 
okay .   so what does ' just over the street ' mean -- give it to me in yards . 
no thank you .   i need to get my car back . 
oh jesus . 
no that 's fine .   i was going to steal one myself but now i 've changed my mind .   signed by the author i see . 
thanks .   i 'll think about it . 
no thanks .   i 'll just look around . 
i have n't decided . 
nice surprise . 
really -- do n't do that -- i 'm sure this is not his job . 
tempting but ... no thank you . 
well that 's the signature -- and above it says ' dear rufus -- you belong in jail . ' 
what 's your name ? 
well no -- i 'm sure he was friendly -- to demi moore -- who acted with him in ' ghost . ' 
i ca n't say i know patrick all that well . 
is that right ? 
no . mister harding that is not true . 
yes mister harding ? 
yes mister harding ? 
no secrets mister harding . let 's get it all out in the open ... 
have you ever speculated mister harding that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements ? 
and yet you suspect her . 
but you have no proof . 
am i to take it that there is n't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter ?   mister harding you 've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men . 
he also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere but he did n't say how . he has been heard to say to his wife ' i hate you i do n't ever want to see you again . you 've betrayed me . '   so . does anyone care to touch upon this further ? 
at the close of friday 's meeting we were discussing mister harding 's problem concerning his wife ...   mister harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street . is that correct mister harding ? 
mister washington . 
get up billy . 
who ? tell me ! 
billy that girl could n't have pulled you in there forcibly ... 
i do n't want your mother to believe something like this but what am i to think ? 
you should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here ! 
you mean you do n't want their votes to count billy ! 
billy were you afraid of her or of her love ? 
what was it about her that disturbed you so billy ? 
tell us about it ... 
was it your idea to visit her on sunday ? 
yes billy ? 
mister sefelt ? 
would you like to start ? 
yes . good luck mister mcmurphy . 
certainly mister mcmurphy with pleasure . 
good . why do n't you join us ? 
i hope everything is settled . 
welcome back . 
mister mcmurphy . 
no it was irresponsible ! 
mr. mcmurphy you had no right to take these men out with you ! 
you men remain seated !

smells like piss . is this real candy ? is this really real ? i mean we are in an insane asylum an ' i wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene . 
are they dangerous when they 're awake ? 
is he one of the loonies ? 
what 's that ? 
whew ! hiya boys ! 
look she was n't a relative okay ? i do n't know who she is . 
of course not . 
no she was n't my sister . 
yes but ...   he was having an affair . 
really .   she thinks he 's here . even though she 's never met him . even though she 's never laid eyes on him . 
so she can drive through the streets of rome paging the man of her dreams . 
she 's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker . 
my friend has lost her fucking mind ... 
he 's gone .   he told me what happened .   he just left for the airport . 
what about larry ? 
well ... i ought to be getting home anyway .   the kids'll be back from camp soon .   the house is probably a mess . 
well i realized if you 're getting married you 're gon na be needing the maid of honor right ? 
uh huh . 
when you could 've found one in america . 
yes .   he is . 
or maybe it 'll turn him back into a toad . 
i thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you would n't need to change . 
and he is living proof . 
uh huh ...   okay we 'll be there . how is he anyway ? 
faith i 'm kidding .   is this how you plan to get what you want from life ?   when you finally find it you turn and run away from it ? 
it means you 're a completely worthless excuse for a human being and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable . 
whatareyoudoing ? ! 
joan collins stayed here . 
peter found him ? 
i 'll be back before you leave . 
you sure you 'll be okay ? 
i 'm just not ready to go home quite yet that 's all . 
who said i was going ? 
what about peter ? ... 
... and a fortune teller . 
i know but ... 
so you 're just quitting ?   just like that ? 
okay a lot of bad luck .   but that means the odds are probably in your favor now .   this is no time to give up . 
so you 've had a little bad luck . 
sightseeing ...   what 're you doing ? 
hi - iii ... 
men have ways . 
yeah .   sociopaths .   they 're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that . 
no ... like a psychiatrist . 
i think it 's time we got some professional help . 
that was really sweet ... 
and then what faith ? 
well nobody can say we did n't try . 
good luck . 
faith .   so far you 've trailed the man halfway around the globe .   at this point i do n't think another fifteen feet is gon na tip the scales . 
he 's sitting in the fourth booth down on the left hand side with his back to us .   he 's wearing a navy jacket .   if you turn around you can see part of his right elbow . 
he 's heeeeeerrre ... 
not if you do n't count the sixth grade . 
i never even got to be single . 
well how come we 're always looking for guys for you ? 
so what 's in a name ?   i wanna join him .   i do n't see why we ca n't join him . 
you 've travelled over six thousand miles and now you 're gon na play hard to get ? 
you 're right .   at least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself .   smile . 
what 's she saying ? 
what did you say to her ? 
her brother . 
he went out and bought himself men 's cologne the other day .   did i tell you that ? 
that was a long time ago . 
you know when larry and i got married i thought we were so lucky we found each other so early . people talk about spending their lives together how many of them really get to ?   but maybe i was wrong .   maybe sooner or later everything wears out . 
you think he misses me at all ? 
so what exactly is larry 's side of the story anyway ? 
well you do n't have to get snippy with me . 
what 's that supposed to mean ? ... 
i 'm hungry . 
we would 've had enough gas to get us there if you had n't gotten us lost .   besides a kilometer is less than a mile . 
could n't we just have taken a train ? 
your brother ? 
only what ? 
what is it ? 
we 're not looking to arrest the man faith we 're trying to locate him . 
a rich possibly fat slob . 
what 'd you find ? 
i just got a dial tone-- 
i do n't think he understood what you were saying .   what 's the airport number ? 
you ca n't really blame him for being upset .   it was an armani suit . 
what are you doing ? 
faith i 've seen it already okay ? if i spot somebody who 's got a head that 's an eighth of an inch around standing underneath a tuba i 'll recognize him from the photo . otherwise i 'm telling you it 's not gon na do me any good . 
you and the other 99 % of the women in the world . 
you gave it your best shot .   you tried . 
yes .   cathy lee crosby stayed here . 
this is a lifestyles hotel . 
the book said they have boats that are like taxis ...   vaporettos .   what 's the name of the place we 're staying again ? 
you okay ? 
i keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies . 
live happily ever after . 
a foreign land full of millions of italian men ...   speaking italian with italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin ... 
you 're just going to fly to italy and start combing the streets ? 
my god you have ... 
i ca n't believe we did this .   do i have to remind you that your wedding is in six days ? 
does dwayne know about this ? 
because you were afraid to fly . 
you do n't have a passport . 
what about your job ? 
but it 's july . 
it 's a coincidence . 
no ...   i can just tell . 
i think he 's having an affair . 
larry brought me flowers last night . 
i mean just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it 's all supposed to be perfect ?   well guess what ? ... it is n't .   not for you not for anybody . 
people have problems insecurities flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise to overlook to forgive .   it 's not settling faith it 's life .   real life . 
let me tell you something about love .   there are no prince charmings there are no glass slippers .   love is hard work . 
but one day you wake up and realize you 've been had .   of course life is n't like the movies .   that 's why there are movies . 
that 's the problem .   when you 're a kid you think life is gon na be like the movies .   dreams come true the good guys win people live happily ever after ... all that crap .   turn . 
but what ? 
i think it was sweet of him to pick it out . 
come on it 's not so bad . 
well i would n't 've if i had n't thought i was in love . 
he begged me to marry him .   i did n't even want to marry him . 
if you 've never been out with him how do you know you do n't want to go out with him ? 
why do n't you ask him ? 
you do n't have any idea ? 
what 's he do ? 
so ? ... 
is he gay ? 
is he married ? 
yeah well larry and his friends are hungry .   and i did say i 'd try to pick something up . 
no faith .   they came out of somebody 's imagination . 
so what 's your point ? 
yes .   you know all the shrinks on donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people 's fantasies . 
i think if you 're honest with yourself you 'll admit you 've had a chance at a number of amana appliances in your lifetime . 
it 's a metaphor .   it 's women who always think there 's some unknown out there that 's going to be better than what 's in front of them .   and instead wind up with nothing . 
so you got ta be a little flexible . look at your brother and me . larry 's not perfect neither am i.   but we work it out .   we 're not unrealistic in our expectations and we have each other .   i think you 've got the door number three syndrome . 
how about that guy at the bank ? 
how about the other one ?   his friend . 
what about that guy you work with mike what's - his - name ? 
you 're an accountant for cryin ' out loud . 
i do n't know i guess i never really thought about it ...   is larry here ? 
that 's exactly what you are . 
but i do want to . 
no you do n't understand .   it 's been wonderful meeting you .   but ... i have a husband .   i have two kids at camp .   i have a life i have to go back to . 
giovanni i want to thank you . 
how old are you ? 
i 'd love to . 
giovanni this is faith 's friend peter . 
a porco ? 
my friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is .   can you tell us what she 's saying ? 
no .   well i do n't know .   well maybe .   later . 
and you did n't tell her ? 
she what ? ! 
faith .   larry has something he wants to tell you about damon bradley . 
he missed me . 
larry you 've got to tell her . 
went to high school with him . but ... 
are you saying you just made the whole thing up ?   the guy never even existed ? 
what ?   you know him ? 
you said it differently then . 
do n't call me doll larry .   i hate it when you call me doll . 
sociologist .   and because .   pawn shops are just like prostitutes farm auctions and coal miners .   they 're all for sale but none of 'em would be if they were n't desperate for the money . 
not only is it tacky it 's exploitation . 
no why ? 
you miss me ? ... 
oh it 's you .   it 's only peter . 
that 's the guy you 've been waiting for all these years ? 
ten billion to one . 
that 's really romantic . 
good strategy . 
she went out to check into skywriting .   i ca n't believe you lied .   is this a genetic thing men will say anything just to get laid ? 
she 's not here . 
it was late in arriving .   but it 's here now . 
you do n't understand .   the man i 'm supposed to marry is on that plane . 
i-- i must 've misplaced it . 
so .   how do we get to rome ? 
no ...   it 's just very important that i find him okay ? 
nobody here has any idea which way he went ? 
he could n't have checked out-- i was supposed to meet him here . 
excuse me ? 
you ask what room he 's in okay ? 
what is it ? 
it 's alright ...   this is our destiny . 
we found each other did n't we ? 
do n't be afraid .   you can tell me . 
let 's find a telephone . 
i 've never been more sure of anything in my life . 
it just happened .   i did n't plan it .   i was alone .   and he was ... there .   but now everything 's changed .   i owe it to him to let him know .   i need to tell him . 
i feel like i 've been wandering in the desert for as long as i can remember .   with nothing but emptiness around me wind and sun ...   and suddenly out of the blue somehow i 've found the oasis . 
okay .   good idea .   you first . 
my hair 's kind of a mess is n't it ? 
dwayne pinsley .   from high school . that 's how i knew you were here . when you called from the airport . 
and he 's a friend of yours .   it 's dwayne . 
i 'm engaged .   i 'm supposed to be married in two days . 
there is one other thing you should know about me . 
my car bumper has never held a winning sticker . 
i 'm a liberal ! 
you do n't think this is just infatuation do you ? 
that 's it .   that 's it .   that 's all i need to know .   bless you thank you thank you . 
what 's mezzaluna ? 
ask her if she knows how i might reach him ?   if she has a telephone number ? 
ask her if she knows where he is ? 
what ? ... 
i 'll bring it back as soon as i can . 
please larry .   i have to hurry . 
do n't worry it 's a long story but i know who he is .   i know where to find him . 
larry can i borrow your car keys ? 
larry !   what are you doing here ?   mom sent you . 
we 'll know . 
if i live here then he lives here . fate would n't make a mistake like that .   and stop talking .   you 're gon na ruin the spell . 
do n't be stupid larry .   if he 's my destiny then obviously he has to be alive . 
wait .   i have to write this down . 
non .   please . 
so this is what you do ?   i mean when you 're not playing other parts ? 
no you gave a very convincing performance .   and you 'll be pleased to know that your eight - by - ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse . 
before you start picking your nose i know he put you up to it . 
venice ?   i love venice .   with the boats right ? ... 
where are you going ? 
uh-- in case dwayne wants to try to reach you . 
wait ! !   where are you ? 
damon bradley ... 
i can hardly hear you .   could you spell that ? 
i 'm sure he 'll be sorry to hear that .   who should i tell him called ? 
this is his fiancee .   who 's this ? 
he 's not in at the moment .   can i take a message ? 
hello ?   is anybody there ? 
i brought you that too . 
there is no us . 
that 's not the point .   and what if i had wanted to ? 
no it is n't .   i called off my wedding all because of you . 
gee i 'm flattered .   what an incredibly romantic gesture . cancel the roses i 've decided to lie to her instead . 
rational ? !   love is not rational ! are you crazy ? 
i would call it-- unforgivable . 
well i might 've found him again if i had n't left rome to make this pointless trip down here with you . 
you 're the reason i never met him . you knew it was the thing i most wanted in life and you sabotaged it . 
i ca n't believe you did that ! 
no one had to tell me .   he 's starring in the local play . 
who cares ? !   you hired an actor ? ? 
you want a hint ?   i 'll give you a hint .   you are the lowest most despicable most reprehensible form of reptilian swine-- 
get out ! ! 
i just need to run up and get my bathing suit . 
yes .   i am . 
thank you .   so since i have a few more days of vacation left i was wondering if maybe you 'd want to do something sometime .   i mean you know if you do n't have ... other plans . 
no .   i mean yes i 'm not .   i decided to call it off .   well actually it was kind of mutual . 
yeah ...   well anyway i also wanted to tell you i 'm not getting married . 
it seems like ever since i found out about this guy this name i 've been kind of crazy .   like i was on drugs or something . 
no .   i just came by to apologize . 
hi .   are you ... busy ? 
no .   course not . 
no it was more than that .   it was very generous of you .   it was very kind . 
i feel like the world 's biggest idiot . 
well how about those old romantic movies with those great stars huh ? like audrey hepburn . 
how about music ?   you like classical ? 
well what about books ?   you like hemingway ?   you got ta love hemingway . 
so were you . 
why are you doing this ? 
i do n't know if that 's such a-- 
you were saying ... 
what are you doing here ? 
thank you peter .   thank you so much . 
you too . 
just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs .   nothing fancy . 
well good .   good for you . 
oh .   that 's nice . 
you found him .   i do n't know how to thank you . 
hi peter . 
right now ? 
mickey spillane ? 
please .   i need to know . 
tell me . 
he likes to read ...   did he mention anyone in particular ? 
oh no i do n't think that would be a good idea . 
where 's positano ? 
why not ? 
who says i do n't love him ? ... 
do n't you see ? ..   we 're not the ones who are meant to be .   you 're the man of somebody else 's dreams . 
no that was n't a lie .   that was ...   a mirage . 
so it was n't real . 
look peter i do n't hate you . but what we had was an illusion . mutual wishful thinking .   we both wanted to believe it for awhile but it was all founded on a lie . 
why are you asking me this ? 
he wants to marry me does n't he ? 
so ? !   is there something wrong with loving somebody who 's safe ? 
because i know who dwayne is and he 's reliable and stable and wants to marry me . 
if it 's any of your business yes . 
i know i 'm limping .   i stubbed my toe . 
oh come on ...   what kind of an excuse is that ? 
how could you do this to me ? 
that was before i found out what it was . 
that 's not the point . 
so you say you 've been to italy before ? 
oh hello . 
uh the scampi sounds good to me too . 
you like shrimp ?   i like shrimp . 
what looks good ? 
do n't worry about it .   you 're my guest . 
excuse me ? 
well to-- new friends . 
oh faith .   my name 's faith . 
okay .   good .   see you then then . 
you would ?   really ? 
would you be willing to have dinner with me ? 
any night . 
i was wondering ...   do you have dinner plans ? 
i just got here too .   not yesterday .   but just now .   today . just a few minutes ago .   yeah we just got here ...   i mean i just got here .   i 'm single . 
been here long ? 
beautiful place ... 
you 're damon bradley ? 
larry did you rent a car ? 
i 'm fine .   have you seen peter ? 
i do n't know .   i 've just been thinking ... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do - it - yourself operation .   maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for . 
and larry ? ... 
actually no .   there 's not going to be a wedding . 
i did n't expect you back so soon . 
kate is that you ? 
so .   i guess i 've got a wedding to go to . 
i came all the way to italy in search of a weasel . 
i spent my whole life waiting for a creep . 
he 's a jerk . 
maybe if i kiss him i 'll feel it . 
maybe i can change him . 
no i think maybe you 've been right .   i think i may have been too critical in the past . 
no one 's perfect kate . 
kate .   thank god you 're there . i need help . 
my god ... you 're right . 
what if he does n't like me ? 
is damon bradley here ? 
he 's down in someplace called positano .   peter says we can make it there by morning . 
yes .   is n't that amazing ? 
i 'm sure .   and kate thank you for coming .   thank you for being such a good friend . 
no .   no you go ahead . 
the last dead end in a long series of dead ends that i am relieved to finally be leaving behind .   may as well start packing our cab 's gon na be here in an hour . 
peter ?   peter was a mistake .   an imposter . 
yeah well obviously it was n't meant to be .   i 've got forty - eight hours .   i can still make it home in time to marry dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened . 
it was a ouija board remember ? 
i thought you were the one who did n't think i should 've come in the first place . 
why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place ?   children are very impressionable you know . 
a little bad luck ? 
because i 've been kidding myself . because i realized you were right from the beginning .   this whole thing was just a wild goose chase . 
hi .   where 've you been ? 
but how could he know ?   he only just met me . 
do n't be silly .   how 's a psychiatrist gon na find him ? 
like a detective . 
i meant about my idea . 
and then ... we rent a truck or a car either one and we set up a loudspeaker and we drive through the surrounding areas and we page him . 
okay here 's what i think .   we find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system 's really not that big in rome we could narrow it down and-- 
right .   okay ...   it 's meant to be right ?   this is it . 
right right ...   okay ..   you do n't think he 's gon na think i 'm too aggressive ? 
is he looking at us ? 
oh my god .   where ? 
okay okay .   you join him .   but first will you ask if he 's here ? 
sure you did . 
because i 'm the one who 's single . 
i told you .   if he sees me here with another guy he 's gon na think i 'm here with another guy .   i just do n't want to send any confusing signals . 
i sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he 'd notice me first ? 
all of the sudden i 'm feeling kind of nervous .   god i hate blind dates .   why could n't we just have arranged marriages in america ? 
i do n't know .   i just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden-- 
right .   my brother . 
anna i 'm faith .   you do n't know how happy i am to meet you .   you see i 'm trying to find someone and-- 
larry bought himself cologne ? 
and you know what i thought then kate ?   i thought i hope someday i have somebody who loves me that much .   i still hope that . 
' course he does . 
i do n't know kate .   i just said that .   i 'm sorry .   i 'm just on edge .   i 'm afraid we 're losing him . 
you expecting somebody you know ? 
you know no offense or anything kate but i think i 'm starting to see larry 's side of the story . 
right .   so we should 've been able to cover more of them . 
i told you a liter was less than a gallon . 
the book said they have a lot of rail strikes in italy . 
what was i gon na do ?   tell him the truth ? 
only it 's in italian ... 
a phone message .   only-- 
we 're saved ! 
oh .   right . 
maybe there 's fingerprints on it ? 
a butterfinger wrapper . 
ah ha ! ... 
so maybe his room has n't been cleaned yet .   maybe there 's something in there that might help us .   maybe they 'll let us go in and take a look around . 
the guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago right ? 
did i or did i not offer to have it cleaned ? 
he fell out . 
just once more so you 'll be sure to know what to look for . 
i 'll never meet the man of my dreams . 
we lost him ? ... 
i ca n't believe we came all this way and he 's gone . 
well we 're here .   and more importantly he 's here .   we 'll cut back on everything else . 
are you sure ? 
i do n't know ...   maybe .   think of it as an adventure . 
it 's called ... the gritty palace . 
now what do we do ? 
sure .   i 'm fine .   i do n't know why i never did this before .   i mean what 's the big deal ? 
you 're coming with me ? 
how hard can it be ?   i 'll land there i 'll go to his hotel i 'll introduce myself and-- 
he was on his way to venice right ? i called the tourist bureau and i must 've called every hotel in the city but i found where he 's staying . 
thank you so much . 
no i have n't .   and you forgot about the fortune teller . 
look i know you think this is irresponsible of me but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person . 
of course not .   i told him i was going to visit a great aunt .   and do n't tell larry either . 
would you stop saying that ?   i need you to do me a really big favor . 
that 's where you 're wrong .   i got one nine years ago .   i just never had an opportunity to use it . 
i have vacation time coming to me . 
it 's still the new year ... 
it was my new year 's resolution to overcome it . 
the woman at my dry cleaners believes there 's no such thing as coincidence . 
it 's a miracle . 
after all he is my brother and i know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes but i know him pretty well and i really do n't think-- 
have you seen him with someone ? 
is that bad ? ... 
kate is something the matter ? 
i understand kate .   what do you think of this garter ? 
i know .   you 're right . 
yeah .   i guess you 're right .   i really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den . 
oh i do n't know .   i guess it 's just not quite the way i always thought it was going to be .   you know like in the movies . 
i know ...   it was . 
look how big it makes me look .   i look like an alp . 
yes you did . 
why should i ask someone out who i do n't want to go out with in the first place ? 
no .   he 's never asked me . 
he 's a podiatrist or something . 
i do n't know kate . 
so he 's not my type .   let me walk you to the elevator . 
i do n't know .   i do n't think so . 
i wish you did n't have to go so early . 
just that they came out of somebody 's experience is all . 
but somebody wrote those songs . 
is everything okay ? 
metaphorically i still do n't have an amana freezer . 
i do n't have an amana freezer . 
do n't tell me oprah did a show-- 
just moved in with his girlfriend . 
no .   he smokes . 
i do n't believe in statistics . 
yeah .   he 's around somewhere . 
they 're waiting for him to walk in . 
terry ... ? 
tommy what happened ? 
i 'm afraid i spoke out of turn last night . 
father barry . 
do n't turn away ! look at it ! you 're in this too do n't you see do n't you see ? you 're in this too father . 
how could anyone do this to joey . the best in the neighborhood ... . everybody said it not only me . who 'd want to harm joey ? tell me who ?   -- who ? 
time and faith ... . my brother 's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith . 
terry ... ? 
then go ahead go ahead ! go down to the shape - up and get yourself killed you stupid pigheaded son of a   what are you trying to prove ? with a decisive gesture terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt . then he goes to the wall and lifts joey 's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging . he puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way and grins at her as he does so ; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before . 
you heard what johnny said . no part of the waterfront'll be safe for you now . maybe inland the middle west somewhere a job on a farm ... . 
terry you better stay in for a while . i 'll come and cook your meals . be sure you keep the door locked . 
he 's going to have to grow up too . 
are you sure they 're your friends ? 
well it 's over . 
i thought you might want some hot coffee . 
no i ca n't let you . i ca n't you're 
terry for god 's sake . 
terry you 're bleeding . 
terry no no ... . 
i do n't want to see you killed . i want to live with you . live with you . any place it 's safe to walk the streets without ... . 
i mean it let 's get away from here first joey then nolan now charley and any minute ... .   ... i 'm frightened i 'm frightened . 
terry i 'm frightened . more and more frightened . 
i did n't say i did n't love you . i said stay away from me . 
get away from me . 
it 's just a scratch . you wo n't die . she turns away from him . 
i never mentioned the word before . in his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table . 
i do n't want you to do anything . let your conscience tell you what to do . 
it 's you who 's being hurt . by keeping it inside you like a poison . sooner or later it 's got to come out . 
how can you be with charley and johnny friendly and still be with me ? either way it 's a lie . it 's like there were two different people inside of you . you 've got to be one or the other . 
i do n't want to talk about it . i want you to go . 
lucky pop is n't home he 'd kill you . 
do n't tell me do n't tell me ! 
you ... . 
told him what ? 
terry what 's happening to you ? 
who says ? 
terry what 's wrong ? 
i know ... i know ... . 
pigeons ... . 
go ahead wear it . 
i i brought this for you terry . it was joey 's .   yours is coming out at the elbows . 
much more terry . much much more ! 
it 's true . 
look out for number one . always number one .   i should 've known you would n't tell me . pop said johnny friendly used to own you . i think he still owns you .   no wonder everybody calls you a bum . 
it was johnny friendly who killed joey was n't it ? 
what are you going to do ? 
i ca n't let myself fall in love with you . 
why should i come hollering to you at all ? 
why worry about me ? you 're the one who says only look out for yourself . 
it 's fun dancing with your eyes closed . i 'm floating . i 'm floating ... . 
i thought i felt mean tonight . but i 'm not i 'm just all mixed up ... . 
what for ? 
i do n't want it . but why do n't you stay and finish your drink . 
all right all right .. i should n't ' ve asked you . 
like joey ? are you afraid to mention his name ? 
but that 's living like an animal 
and if you do n't ? 
you do n't believe in anything do you ? 
but a priest ... ? 
his racket ? 
he was looking at everybody the same way . asking the same question . 
why terry who said it was ? 
and when things get in your way or people you just knock them aside get rid of them is that your idea ? 
i never met such a person . not a spark of romance or sentiment or or human kindness in your whole body . 
our lord said just the opposite . 
is n't everybody part of everybody else ? 
should n't we care about everybody ? 
what made you want to be a fighter ? 
now what are you doing ? 
a dive ? you mean into the water ? 
were you really a prize fighter ? 
no thanks ... . 
it 's quite   nice . 
wham ... . 
i am ? 
in a saloon ? 
i do n't know . 
even pigeons are n't peaceful . 
oh she 's a beauty . 
the things that go on . 
i would n't have thought you 'd be so interested in pigeons . 
that was nice of you . 
you do n't mind yourself at all do you .   joey used to race pigeons . 
the golden warriors . 
i changed my mind . i feel real mean tonight . 
i really do n't know . 
what for ? 
thanks anyway . 
i 'd better go in . 
do you like pigeons ? 
when mother died pop sent me out to school in the country . he was afraid with no one home i'd get into bad company . 
what 's that ? 
with a little more patience and kindness . that 's what makes people mean and difficult . nobody cares enough about them . 
maybe they just did n't know how to handle you . 
i remember you were in trouble all the time . 
the moment i saw you . 
i can get home all right from here 
i know . i thought i 'd never get those braces off . 
in braids ? that 's right . 
it is n't brains . it 's how you use them . 
i want to be a teacher . 
it 's a regular college . it 's just run by the nuns . the sisters of st. anne . 
you know how the sisters are . 
i better get home . 
what did that man mean when he said you were ... . ? 
everybody loved joey . from the little kids to the old rummies .   did you know him very well ? 
i 'll get home all right now . 
which side are you with ? 
thanks .   steel pipes and baseball bats . 
none of your business . 
give it to me my pop 's job 
let me by . 
pop do n't think i 'm not feeling grateful for all you 've done to get me an education and shelter me from this .   but now my eyes are open . i see things i know are so wrong how can i go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people are n't living ? i 'm staying pop . and i 'm going to keep on trying to find out who 's guilty for joey . i 'd walk home with a dozen terry malloys if i thought they could help me . i tell you i 'm staying pop . pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers . 
and learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice ? pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms his right one closer to edie ; he trembles with emotion . 
he wanted to see me again . 
he was n't abyssinian pop assyrian ... . 
he tries to act tough but there 's a look in his eyes that ... . 
are you trying to tell me terry is too ? 
who is he pop ? 
pop i 'm not ready to go back yet . 
you love me then ? 
i love you bob . i really do . forgive me ? 
maybe so . 
my old boyfriend tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this .   at least < i > he's</i > got brains . 
i still do n't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you . 
what can we do against them ? 
yes that sudden .   if it were n't for you we would n't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this .   it 's all your fault . 
i should hope not .   i hate you ! 
oh no i 'm not .   these heathens probably have an open grave for us . 
yes i feel it in my bones . 
be careful oh please be careful .   we 'll never get out of here alive i know it .   i just feel it . 
i 'm frightened .   i 'm so frightened . 
nothing is worth your life . 
be careful ! 
i 'm afraid i 'll faint . 
what can we do ? 
those creatures .. ! 
i 'm so frightened . 
what do you mean ? 
ca n't we get out of here ? 
could it be some kind of college initiation ? 
i ca n't imagine anything dead playing that music . 
what help will that do if something in there is n't dead ? 
i 'm not sure i care to find out what it is . 
what help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night ? 
then .. then what 's that music ? 
it frightens me . 
i 'm getting the jitters ! let 's turn back ! 
well fact or not i do n't see how we 're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight .   i ca n't see a thing !   let 's turn back . 
that 's life .   my kisses are alive . 
but horror stories !   why all the time horror stories ? 
but there 're so many wonderful things to write about bob . 
but does it have to be in a cemetery ? 
we sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery .   let 's turn back . 
no . no ! no ! 
i 'm so frightened . 
thank you master !   thank you . 
is there time ? 
you mean ... ! 
for what ! ? ! 
all others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff compared to < i > her</i >   this one would have < i > died</i > for feathers furs and fluff ... and so she did ! 
oh if there is only time ! 
the < b > moon</b > is almost < b > gone!</b > 
you had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session . 
the moon sinks lower into the hills !   we must hurry to the finish . 
there are others . 
i understand master 
i would have time for my own pleasures ! 
at the first sight of the morning 's rays ' light ... 
the moon is almost gone ! 
when ! ? 
she is to be < b > mine!</b >   it is so spoken ! 
it would seem so master 
at the first sight of the morning sun 's rays we must be gone . 
as you wish master 
it would seem so master . 
as i said a worshipper of snakes and of smoke and flames . 
el dia de los muertos ... a celebration in her country . 
she loved the bull ring and the matador .   she danced to their destruction . now she dances to her own destruction .   her dance is of skulls . 
a symbol master . 
tie them that they may watch . 
but they are not yet one of us . 
yeah that 's him .   buddy says glenn thinks you guys are real cool . 
well seeing as you have so much luck with cars buddy thought it might be better to bring two .   he got this guy he says you know from lompoc glenn something . 
and the one driving the other car ? 
emil the amazing .   the bastard fired me and hired another girl a redhead . i 'm working on a new business card pass out to the cafes .   how 's this sound-- 
what 's free about it ?   i 'm looking for work . 
so why do n't you come right out and tell me what you 're talking about ? 
did n't you tell me one - time calls are n't monitored ? 
till it 's not funny any more .   what do you want jack ? 
lie face down on the floor . 
who is it ? 
yes it is . 
you 're good . 
who are you ? 
that was n't jack 's fault .   no that was on account of buddy for some reason decided to call his sister and confess to a job < u > before</u > they 'd done it instead of after .   she called the fbi and they both went down ended up at lompoc .   i think buddy felt kinda bad about that . 
jack came out of a bank he just robbed in pasadena could n't get his stolen car to start .   battery was dead .   he looks over sees buddy sitting in a burgundy bonneville goes up offers him a thousand dollars for a jump . turns out buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing .   buddy says i 'll take the thousand but we 're leaving in my car not that piece of shit you come in .   they musta robbed fifty banks together . 
buddy'll take care of him .   keep him out've trouble .   he 's jack 's conscience . always has been .   he tell you how they met ? 
i 'll say one thing for jack he was never ugly or mean or drank too much . he was very considerate lights on or off if you know what i mean . 
huh .   problem is jack 's idea of a normal life is robbing banks .   it 's all he 's ever done . 
he did ?   i do n't remember .   did he say about me ?   in the trunk ? 
he 'd call every once in a while . 
i do n't know .   he was different after he was sentenced looking at thirty years .   said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer . 
he did n't want me to . 
he gets that way when he 's nervous sometimes . 
he did n't hurt you or anything did he ? 
i 'm getting ready to go out .   you can come in if you want sit down for a minute .   would you like a diet coke ? 
i know a glenn . 
they did n't < i > tell</i > me anything they asked questions . 
you were < i > both</i > in the trunk ?   together ? 
go away or i 'll call the police .

wait i know him --okay ? 
oh - kay ... 
come on raymond i 'm a federal officer i 'm armed . 
i 'll need a last known address . 
guy named maurice miller also known as snoopy a former prizefighter . 
listen raymond a year ago dea had this guy glenn michaels on possession with intent but could n't make it stick . in his statement glenn said he went up to detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that . 
detroit you must be pretty busy . 
no i did n't know that . 
i report to the fbi first thing they 're gon na do is ask me to go get some coffee . 
yeah .   i saw one of 'em outside . 
what is it with crack and transsexuals ? 
quite a mess . 
how are you raymond ? 
you know what i mean . 
i 'm sorry jack but i ca n't shoot you . 
what 're you now a desperado ?   put the guns down . 
you think i 'd shoot you ? 
come on jack -- do n't . 
i 'm trying not to .   i just wanna know what 's gon na happen . 
you 're not dumb . 
i do n't know . 
or i did it for some kind of kinky thrill .   score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade . 
i want you to know something .   i was n't looking for just a fuck if that 's what you 're thinking . 
i 'm just going to the bathroom . 
no you 're right .   or buddy .   i wo n't ask if he 's with you or what you 're doing here in detroit .   or if you 've run into glenn michaels yet . 
so she did help you ? 
you were going to see her ? 
i could n't believe it .   i was thinking of you by then a lot wondering what it would be like if we did meet .   like if we could take a time - out ... 
you waved to me in the elevator . 
what were you gon na do with me ? 
you believe that ? 
he killed a police officer . 
you kept touching me feeling my thigh . 
remember how talkative you were ?   in the trunk ?   adele said you do that when you 're nervous . 
you really wear that suit . 
you like taking risks . 
if i remembered you .   i came looking for you .   i would 've said sure let 's do it .   but for all you knew i could show up with a swat team .   why would you trust me ? 
if i had answered what were you gon na say ? 
oh god ... 
or once . 
well does it make sense to you ? 
it 's your game .   i 've never played this before . 
not yet .   do n't say anything yet .   okay ? 
no .   what do you do for a living gary ? 
it smelled . 
i had one just like it -- well it was the same idea but i had to get rid of it . 
i do n't have a problem with it . 
what as a sales rep ? 
i 'm a sales rep .   i came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because i 'm a girl . 
love it . 
no they 're all right .   i meant you just got here . 
do n't leave me . 
it takes hours to get a drink around here .   there 's only one waitress . 
whatta you mean < u > we'll</u > make it an island ? 
one last score that the idea ?   move to some island . 
unless you wanna tell me . 
something i 've been wondering what ever happened to your uncle cully ? 
my dad 's retired .   he was a private investigator .   forty years .   i used to work for him . 
why not ? 
there 's a guy here on the task force right now .   maybe i should put him on the phone let you two work it out . 
let 's see .   you could come on by my dad 's place drop 'em off . 
think i could have them back ? 
how do you know ?   wait-- you have my wallet . 
that 's my dad . 
none of your business . 
how 'd you get this number ? 
get your hands up and turn around . < u > now</u > . 
i mean romantically . 
i never thought it made sense though the way they got together so quick . 
with robert redford when he was young . 
you have to be kidding . 
you 'd probably tell me . 
bleeding on a country road . 
peter finch . 
< i > network</i > .   yeah she was good . 
faye dunaway . 
it was may 1934 near gibsland louisiana . 
they put a hundred and eighty - seven bullet holes in clyde bonnie parker and the car they were driving .   bonnie was eating a sandwich . 
i do n't recall his hat but i 've seen pictures of him lying dead shot by texas rangers .   did you know he did n't have his shoes on ? 
you must see yourself as some kind of clyde barrow . 
you know this is n't gon na end well these things never do . 
uh - huh . 
you were married ?   all those falls i 'm surprised you had time . 
what do you want me to do ?   scream ?   i do n't think it would help much .   i 'm just gon na sit back take it easy and wait for you to screw up . 
of course i am . 
i do n't have to .   i do n't rob banks . 
i know the difference .   you were in lompoc usp the federal penitentiary . i 've delivered people there .   so basically you 've spent half your life in prison . 
it was me i woulda left ol' gus on the floor . 
that 's funny . 
how many was that ? 
why are you famous ? 
so what 's < u > your</u > name ?   it 'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway . 
buddy .   that 's his given name ? 
must be quite a pal risk his own ass like this . 
you would n't have time anyway .   we come to a roadblock they 'll run the car find out in five seconds who it belongs to . 
the idea of going after guys like you appealed to me . 
i believe it .   you 've ruined a nine- hundred - dollar suit my dad gave me . 
in my bag in the car . 
for your breath .   you could use it . squirt some in your mouth . 
if i could have a little more room . 
i 'm a federal marshal and you 're under arrest both of you guys . 
if i did n't know you glenn by tomorrow you 'd be in jail or dead .   look at it that way .   go on . 
but listen glenn .   if you 're lying to me ... 
you want to get out of here run it 'll warm you up . 
gee i wonder why not . 
but you say he has n't shown up you think he backed out ? 
why 's that ? 
and is foley a part of this ? 
ripley ?   you mean the wall street guy ? 
but i thought the whole thing was your idea ? 
what 's going on glenn ? 
for the car for aiding and abetting a prison escape and conspiring to do whatever you came here for . 
glenn i know your life history who your friends are where you 've been and now it looks like where you 're going .   put your hands on the wheel . 
the two guys you were with -- that one that is n't maurice miller is it ? i 've seen snoopy 's mug shot and that did n't look like him . 
you 're not ? 
another one of those days huh nothing seems to go right ? 
glenn are you trying to steal this car ? 
glenn take the exit . 
take the next exit . 
wait .   < i > have</i > you helped him glenn ?   at this point technically i doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive . so you still have a choice .   you can help him and risk going down again get cuffed and shackled hope to god you pull a reasonable judge not some hard - on .   or if you want to play it another way ... 
look i can understand if you and foley are close . 
foley 's not going to make it .   and if he goes down glenn you go with him . 
do we have a gun in the car ? 
last fall i drove you from the palm beach county jail to the federal courthouse twice .   you 're glenn michaels .   i never forget anyone i 've cuffed and shackled . 
no that 's not what i 'm thinking . 
you do n't remember me do you ? 
i 'll send it to you at glades . 
how 's it going ? 
he took the week off so we 'd have time together .   so far he 's worked on his boat every day .   dad ?   ray nicolet . 
hi ray . 
you wanted to tussle we tussled . 
just a minute . 
you 're not my type . 
what 'd you fight middleweight ? 
i can tell . 
you 're a fighter ? 
the state theater ? 
where do you think i might find maurice ? 
what did you call it ? 
your dog was killed ? 
he said he stayed with maurice . 
he said he stayed here last november . 
no i 'm not .   maybe you know him . glenn michaels ? 
i 'm looking for a friend of mine i think maurice knows . 
that 's not maurice ? 
i 'm looking for maurice . 
moselle miller ? 
he knew what he was doing .   nobody forced him to rob banks . 
it 's possible .   why ? 
none i 'd like to share . 
so what i want to know is why buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in . 
buddy 's sister regina mary bragg got two calls from buddy up in detroit this morning called burdon .   she 's also the one gave burdon buddy 's address . 
i did n't have time . 
i could n't swear to it but i 'm pretty sure he did . 
foley < i > kid</i > napped me . 
my married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity .   i could n't believe it . 
i want to bust his ass put him in shackles . 
not at all . 
he 's pretty laid back confident . 
was it foley ? 
ray 's with the f.b.i. task force working on the prison break . 
no he looks a lot ... 
he does n't even look like that . 
the sig sauer you got me for my birthday . 
what 'd i say ? 
how 'bout i come next sunday and watch the super bowl with you ?

--sig - sauer .38 .   i love it . 
it 's beautiful . 
you fit another chanel suit in here ? 
so beautiful ! 
well ... sure . 
he told me he did n't want to leave me with regret .   now that 's all i have . 
i was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes .   do you think that 's why we 're meeting .   to help us say goodbye to rafe ? 
we got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident but it 's quiet .   except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us . 
he said you 're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him . 
you were more like brothers . 
he told me about you .   that he had no other friend like you . 
were .   is n't that what you mean ?   were . because he 's dead is n't he ?   and that 's why you 've come . 
you take care dorie . 
tell me something dorie .   a man as big as you -- and smart too you knew where to come when your ship could n't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect ? 
what do you get for winning ? 
how often you fight like this ? 
i 'm evelyn .   and i 'm just a nurse .   but i 'm not playing golf and that cut needs sewing or else it 's gon na make a big lumpy scar .   whatta ya say ? 
what 's your name ? 
how 'd you get this ? 
wait let me look at that ... you better come in here . 
our doctor 's gone too . 
it was .   i could n't have you go away wherever it is ... to war ... without knowing something .   you think i made a choice of danny over you .   i did n't .   i did n't have a choice .   i 'm pregnant . 
they were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along .   i wrote colonel doolittle and told him i needed to see you before you go . 
that 's what i have to tell you rafe .   it was n't a choice .   it -- 
rafe ... no .   you forgive me . 
there 's nothing you can do here they 'll die or they wo n't we just -- 
it 's not that i did n't mean everything i wrote .   it 's just that -- i thought you were dead .   and now -- 
it 's not your fault rafe .   the letter i wrote you they -- 
it 's been ... so different being so sure you were dead . 
i 'm just ... so amazed so glad to know that you 're okay .   you are okay are n't you ? 
how did you ? ... 
why were you sitting here instead of ... 
do one thing for me before you go . 
i do n't know if you can choose that rafe . 
you waited til tonight to tell me ? 
but you 're in the u.s. army how could you -- 
we 're all going away . 
it surprises me that i 'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way . 
whatever you 're trying to tell me is n't good is it .   or it would n't be so hard to say . 
i was hoping to meet him . 
danny 's not coming ? 
oh this is betty . 
you too lieutenant . 
do you have to wear that hat ? 
i hope so . at least i got to see you and grandma .   has it ever worked before ? 
what does grandma think you do at your meetings ? 
goodbye grandma . 
grandpa if you had a chance to do it all again what would you do ? 
that never changes .   you know when you and grandma are gone the family 's gone . i never see the cousins anymore . 
i remember that book !   grandpa grandma i want to tell you something . 
do you believe in all of that ? 
i do n't know . reunions do funny things to people . 
i feel ridiculous . maybe i should go home and change . 
not from the guy with the lowest prices in town . 
borrow ? ! this was my dress .   maybe it 's a mistake . what if i 'm the only one ? i do n't even want to go . everybody 's just going to say ...   hi .. where 's crazy charlie ? 
then we 'd both have a miserable time . what do you think ? 
but i want you and scott to understand .   do you think he loves janet ? maybe he 's smashed too many fortune cookies . 
how do you like my hair ? 
this is my old friend carol .. i told you about her . 
look carol maybe walter 's done you a big favor . you always said you wanted to get out of town . go for it . and be happy goddamnit i 'm rooting for you . 
welcome to the singles ' scene . 
what happened ? 
what 's the matter ? 
okay . but let 's have a girls night soon . maybe a pajama party . 
that loudmouthed little bitch~ 
you 're kidding ... ? carol you have beautiful hair . 
did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts ? 
on what ? 
he does ? 
he is kind of cute is n't he ? 
i do n't get it . 
yes . let 's stay in touch . 
that 's okay . i 'm sure i 'll remember the way . 
maddy what did you do to your hair ? 
where is it ? 
i ca n't . it 's all too much . 
well besides charlie of course . 
your first boyfriend . what do you think ? any sparks left ? 
oh it 's not so bad . i have two wonderful kids my own business .   still knowing what i know now if i had the chance to do it all over again i 'd sure do things a lot differently . 
it 's not the place . i do n't buy that .   trapped in the same town forever . the price she would pay for her teenage lust . 
we did for a long time . we just got married too young and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things . 
i do n't know how you do it . i 've never even dated anybody but charlie . 
1 just did it for the reunion . i thought it would be fun . 
do n't try to charm me charlie bodell . 
then hold me . 
you were terrific .   and i kept trying to push you away but you would n't give up . 
it could n't be me .   i hardly knew him . 
what about janet ? 
charlie i thought i knew everything about you . 
you look awful like you have n't slept in days . and so old . 
charlie ? was i dead ? 
i 'm trying . 
i 'll love you too charlie . i 'll love you for twenty years . 
i 've got to go now . 
do you think anybody in the fifties ever made love on a bed ? 
i know . 
oh charlie . 
will you take me back to my grandparents ? 
i might be crazy but i 'm not crazy enough to marry you twice . there 's a lot of things i ca n't change . i ca n't even think about them . i tried . but i could n't even help rosalie .   i do n't want to be bitter . i 'm a naturally optimistic person . but you took advantage of that . 
what do you mean you and my father decided ? who the hell are you to plan my life ? let 's get married and live happily ever after . bullshit . i got knocked up . i had to marry you . i never had a choice . 
how could you possibly know what i 've been going through ? 
let me got ! where are you taking me ? 
do n't be ridiculous ! they 're just a bunch of harmless old men . my grandfather was in there . 
what the hell did you do that for ? what are you doing here ? 
forget it it 'll never work . 
it means i care about you and what happens to you . 
just take a look at it . 
not exactly but with your great voice it 'll be a huge hit . honest . 
stop being defensive . i want to help you . i wrote a song for you . 
i 'd forgotten how much music meant to you . 
what were you doing there ? you never told me you were singing with an r and b group . 
i was at lena 's last night . you were terrific . 
well how about a walk charlie bell .. 
oh . i guess i always liked rusty better .   could you give me a ride to school ? 
i wanted to talk to you and i have one last thing to take care of at school . then i 'm going to ...   good dog rusty . good dog . 
i 'm trying to save you years of frustration ... waiting for a big break ... no . waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me . 
everything . i have a good head for business i should be franchising the bakery . and i want you to give me your word that whatever happens you 'll go to college . and finish . 
that 's just it . you can always get to me . there 's this window in my heart and every time i leave it open you climb in . unless i close it now nothing 's ever going to be different ! 
i just ca n't trust you anymore . 
that wo n't make any difference . we just ca n't live together . and you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo janet . 
charlie . i 've been trying to postpone this . but what 's the point ? it 's over .   i do n't want to hurt you . this is very hard for me . i 'm doing this for both of us . i really want you to be happy . 
and why do you always refer to yourself in the third person like napoleon ? how come it always turns into an argument with you ? 
you know i never could stand your sarcasm . 
i bumped into him after you dropped me off last night . i did n't feel like going home so we went for a ride . 
what are you doing here ? 
charlie . i just had the strangest dream . 
what am i going to do with you ? 
but i 'm not . i 'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you could n't possibly understand . 
charlie . about last nights .. 
what do you know about classical music ? 
i 'm sorry charlie . 
this is a mistake . we better forget it . 
you know . your love machine ... the throbbing thrill hammer ... your thing ! 
i probably meant it when i said it .   does n't lucky chuckie want to come out ? 
a lot 's happened since last weekend . 
charlie let 's make love . 
you really love me do n't you ? 
mmm . this is nice .   i always loved the way you kiss .   i missed you . 
you 're pretty charming when you want to be . 
come on let 's dance . 
he 's trying . 
charlie what do you think of richard norvik ? 
seriously . what 's it like to be eighteen ? 
charlie how are you ? 
right . i promised my mother . 
it 's really fifties . you sort of clash with the world . 
where did you get that sweater ? 
rejected worthless miserable . 
i thought it had a lot of merit . 
would you ? 
they 'll learn to live with it . 
why wait ? 
maybe i blocked it out . 
refresh my memory . 
oh yeah ? 
you drive like a maniac ! 
not now charlie . i 've got a headache . get used to the word . roll it around your tongue for a years . 
pretty strange . 
charlie ! am i dead ? 
are you taking janet to the reunion tonight ? 
i know . put scott through college . 
i do n't buy them anymore . you were the only one who drank them . 
well today 's saturday and it 's still not here . 
i 'm still waiting for the mortgage check . 
there 's something pathetic parked in front of my house . 
yeah . come on charlie turn it off . 
i ca n't . i 'm too embarrassed . 
do n't say that ... 
have a nice day . 
i beg your pardon ? 
sorry . these fountain pens are so tricky . 
touchy touchy ! 
dolores ca n't you be a little kinder to people ? you do n't even know the boy . if you were n't so neurotic and insecure maybe you 'd shut up for a while and show some compassion . 
first of all richard is not a creep . he happens to be an exceptional person . if any of you gave him half a chance you 'd find that out . 
it was my idea grandma . i always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings . 
my children make me happy . i miss them so much .   beth . scott and beth .   i 'm going to name my daughter after you . 
but i 'm remembering the future . 
i wish she had n't . 
fine .   ) grandma would you teach me how to make strudel ? 
i 'm not going to marry him . i just went out with him once .   i know ! why do n't we go to the movies tonight . just us girls . it 'll be fun . 
cool it kids . he 's free to see other girls if he wants . 
he 's very interesting . for all his pretending to be a tough guy he 's really got the soul of a poet . 
she 's unbelievable . who needs satellites when we 've got dolores 's mouth ? 
do n't get your hopes up . 
beth 's boyfriend is playing in the band . 
it was beth 's idea . 
i thought i knew everything about him . 
ssh . he 's great . 
it 's charlie ! 
yes . we had a glorious night together . one day you 'll remember and write about it . 
that 's a terrific line . you 're going to be a wonderful writer . 
michael you and i are light years apart . you should go but not with me . 
i hate chickens . 
i ca n't do that . 
utah ? i thought you 'd be going to new york or paris . what 's in utah ? 
for everyone . 
i should n't have put you through that . it must have been agony . let 's do something . 
i 'd love to . 
is that one of your poems ? 
i already did that . i want to be a dancer i want to dance . 
they care about you . they 're just a different generation . 
do n't you get along with your parents ? 
what are you shooting for ? 
yeah . i 'm surprised . it 's really old ...   travels well though .   you know the world looks a lot better from up here . 
hey man i 'm a hip chick . 
coffee and a donut . 
the young man leaned back in his chair . no bulls would die today . 
maybe you 're confusing his life with his work . 
you do n't ? 
i was impressed with what you said in english class today . 
oh you 're both so naive . 
oh no ! 
how did it go with the pantyhose ? 
wrong dad . your idea . 
you need a partner . there 's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars mr. fitzsimmons . i 've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night . 
ta da ! pantyhose ! the death of the garter belt ! of course once they 're manufactured they 'll look better than this . what do you think ? 
he 'll win . 
but when john f. kennedy 's elected president men'1l stop wearing hats . 
the hat business is in trouble . 
quiet today ? 
i wanted to apologize for this morning . 
i closed my christmas club . 
open it . 
hi dad . 
listen dad please . buy ibm buy polaroid buy apple computer . no no . not yet . buy xerox ! 
oh boy that 's another thing that 's going to change . who 's going to think for us ? our husbands ? you know you treat mom like a maid . it 's not entirely your fault . those were the attitudes in the fifties and that 's the way you raised me . but give nancy a break encourage her to go to art school . 
i think they 're going to deregulate it . 
i want to help with the family finances . i want you to buy some stocks . and gold . by 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce . then you sell . 
calm down . just listen for a minute .. please . 
dad .. it 's not a big deal . did n't you ever stay out all night when you were young ? 
at my age ? do n't be silly . 
it 's not charlie . it 's me . 
i think i 'm way ahead of them . 
mom is there any coffee left ? 
that would be impossible . 
dad i never knew you had a sense of humor . 
grounded ? ha ! the story of my life . i do n't wanna go to my room . i wanna import japanese cars . i wanna go to liverpool and discover the beatles . 
just a little . i 've had a tough day . 
he 's a liar ! he has no such thing ! it 's my own fault . i should have had it patented first . he 's a crook damnit . 
yeah i know peggy sue gets married . case closed . period . mom if you could live your life over again would you do the same thing ? get married and settle down after high school ? 
you know mom it 's okay to have male friends . besides it 's over with me and charlie . 
no just a friend of mine . i do n't think he likes jello. 
mom how about a machine that 's like your blender only it slices vegetables kneads dough chops meat and even make fresh pasta ? 
we 've got to move fast . this is an idea whose time has come . 
instead of a girdle . and light as a feather . 
way to go mom ! 
i went for a drive . up in the hills . 
i do n't feel very festive . 
for what ? 
what do you mean ? 
i 'm confused about a lot of things right now . charlie 's only one of them . 
i 'm sorry mom . i 'll call grandma back and apologize . 
she did ? i love her so much and i have n't seen her in such a long time . and grandpa barney . is he all right ? 
i had a dream that grandma died . 
it 's grandma . i ca n't talk to her now .   i 'm sorry grandma . 
sure mom .   hello . 
it was great to see everybody again . but it 's so boring and regimented . most of what they teach is useless . the worst thing was lunch . 
who was that man ? 
the house payments . 
sort of . 
oh yeah . charlie . how am i going to handle him ? 
oh . ah ... recently . all the kids drink it . 
i 'm still here are n't i ? i may as well enjoy myself . i 'm going to go to school today .   dad i want to apologize for yesterday . the car is a classic . use it in the best of health . 
oh . i forgot . 
oh mom i forgot you were ever so young . 
i 'm home now . 
chanel number five . that always reminds me of home . 
i 'm excused . 
i have a note . 
of course he 'll love it . you 're a terrific artist . 
mom sit down for a minute . this is so nice all of us being together again like this . 
you know you two are wonderful parents . i 'm really going to try to behave myself . 
they 're bad for you . they cause ... red lips . 
do n't eat the red ones . 
it 's unbelievable . the man never ages . 
let 's do something together .. do you want to play monopoly ? or careers ... clue ... snakes and ladders ? 
i 'm sorry about that . i really want us to be closer . i have enough unresolved relationships in my ... life . 
i 'm just happy to see you . 
rosalie please listen to me ! you have to stop . 
but accidents can happen . 
i know you are but you have to stop . i could n't tell you before i did n't know if i should . but you have to stop before you hurt yourself . 
i think you should give up diving . it 's dangerous . 
you have an incredible memory . 
rosalie testa ! 
you ca n't . you 're going to be valedictorian . 
no ! no ! no ! peggy sue got married ! case closed . i do n't want to marry anybody . goodbye richard . 
yeah yeah . i 'm taking a big gamble . i 've loved him for a long long time . 
vision ? i 'm a walking anachronism ! i 've upset my parents . i miss my kids . i could be trapped here forever ! and poor charlie ... i got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married . tomorrow 's my birthday ! i 've got to get out of here now . 
you were meant to   you 're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to . 
i came to say goodbye . 
you were meant to . you 're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to . i have to get out of here . 
it 's all gone wrong nothing 's working out . 
oh go feel up your hamsters ! i hear rodents put out . 
god dammit ! how'm i gon na got out of here ? 
that 's just perfect is n't it ? did it work ? did you find out why i came back ? 
richard ! you should be ashamed of yourself . 
i could n't help it  i loved him . 
yes every day .   maybe i should n't have worn that dress ? i told beth it was a bad idea . that 's why they made me queen . 
no . the pill will be for birth control . but girls do like sex . maybe not the first time . 
no . the pill will change all that . then he would n't have blamed me . we were just too young . 
we were lying in the sand . it was my eighteenth birthday ... we were so awkward ... i would have married him anyway ... 
i think it 's called silicon . charlie told me that . 
ah ..... they 're very tiny ... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set ... 
peggy sue kelcher .   or peggy bodell .   i 'm not sure . 
look i 'm desperate . i 'll try anything . but what if you ca n't snap me out of it ? 
what do you know about hypnosis ? 
like what ? 
for god 's sake forget the money ! i 'm going crazy ! i 'm a walking anachronism . i 'm a puddle of deja i 'm worried about my kids scott must be scared to death i think my daughter 's doing drugs again . i ca n't have any fun here i do n't have that innocence any more . i ca n't keep all this in anymore . i feel like i 'm going to explode . 
it was an unfair fight . he did n't have a chance . i 'm taking a real gamble . i loved him for a long long time . 
yep . it 's going to be a law .   i broke up with charlie last night . 
jogging . i was running now i 'm jogging . 
hi richard . 
the wave of the future ! i 've decided on our first fortune ! i 'll see you later . you just think high tech . 
richard ! they do n't have any ! they never heard of them ! is n't that wonderful ? 
oh . and huge portable radios . everything else gets small but for some reason portable radios get enormous . 
you do n't have to use pig latin ! nobody could possibly know what we 're talking about . 
not for you . okay there 's lots more . 
there are major fortunes to be made here . leisure time and lifestyles . 
ah . this is a biggie . forget sneakers . running shoes jogging shoes tennis shoes . fifty to two hundred dollars a pair . 
when do we start ? 
wbat're you talking about ? 
give me some credit will you ? 
how come you never ask me any important questions ? do n't you wonder if there 's going to be a nuclear war ? or a cure for cancer ? what about your family ? what about people ? 
richard take it easy . 
i tried to tell them but they would n't listen to me . 
i 'm just not the type . besides i want to get out of here . 
i 'm trying . i 'll see you tomorrow . 
i told you i 've already lived my life . i do n't know how or why i 'm here but you have to help me get back . i want to get back to my real life ! 
what if it 's beyond science ? what it it 's god ? 
what 're you doing ? 
am i dead or not ? 
come on richard i 'm serious . 
that 's why i was getting a divorce ..   what i really think is that i had a heart attack at the reunion and died . 
i do n't know . 
because i 'm telling you the truth . i know what 's going to happen . there 's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants . and an american named neil armstrong is going to walk on the moon . on july 20 1969 . 
you have a blind grandfather . one day you 're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people . i read about it . you 're going to be famous . you 're going to invent a lot of things . 
this is serious . nobody can know . ah i 've returned from the future . i traveled back here 25 years . 
listen you 've got ta keep this a secret . you ca n't tell a soul . promise ? 
so you think time travel is possible ? for people ? 
what 's inside ? 
i know what a burrito is .

what a great kite . 
it 's not that . can we meet after school ? please ? 
i have to talk to you . it 's very important . 
congratulations on the math contest richard . 
you know i never told anybody this but i always had a feeling that when you die before you go to heaven you get a chance to fly around high school for a while . 
you 're a sweet man richard . 
what was ? 
well you showed them . you 're rich and famous and successful . and you have a beautiful wife . 
he 's not here . we 're getting divorced .

i was once . richard ! ? richard norvik ? i did n't recognize you . 
what a i going to do for the rest of my life ? i do n't have a boyfriend anymore . 
after charlie told walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field walter decided he should do the same thing . 
it 's that jerk walter . 
are n't we a little old for that ? 
i bet dolores told charlie . 
come on . what 's with you and michael ? 
just what you underlined . 
all right . what 's the scoop ? 
yeah . you 're so lucky . he really loves you too . he 's always telling walter how wonderful you are . 
that 's because you ' re not a total moron like they are . 
i 'll call you later . 
we 're going to take you home . 
were taking you back to the nurse . 
go on . you can do it . 
they 're waiting . come on . 
the only one ? 
who knows . remember ...   whatever walter wants ... 
hi peggy . god that walter getz can still dance . 
would n't we all . 
after you got knocked up my mother did n't want me to talk to you . she thought it was contagious . 
you should have left here years ago like i did . 
so he started having affairs and you got depressed . 
you just have to remember ... men are like houses and trade upwards ... i thought you had a pretty good marriage . 
welcome to the singles scene . 
you 're probably the only one who could carry it off . 
peggy sue ! 
do n't be silly . it 's saturday . date night ! 
you better watch out for her . she 's after charlie . 
i hear she does more than talk with her mouth . 
charlie really has a great voice . 
why do guys do such stupid things ? 
lucky lady . hi . 
mr. fitzsimmons is a very prominent man . 
jack i was just trying to help . 
does everybody have to hear ? 
please do n't shout . 
you have four seasons you have four slumps . 
a new car . we ca n't afford a new car . 
jack take it easy . she gave blood at school today . maybe she 's just a little lightheaded . 
sheerotards . catchy name is n't it ? like leotards . 
what ? when did it happen ? your dad and i always expected you two to get married . 
what does charlie think about that ? 
you know dear i think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea but the next time you come up with something please do n't stay out all night . just tell us . we 'll believe you . 
is n't that awfully forward ? 
would they go over my girdle or under ? 
i 'm not the maid ! 
where have you been ? 
you accepted an invitation maddy 's one of your best friends and i baked the rice krispie squares . 
maddy 's party . 
charlie 's downstairs . why are n't you ready ? 
peggy do you know what a penis is ?   stay away from it . 
is charlie pressuring you to do things you do n't think you should be doing ? 
that 's a good girl ... i hate to see you so upset .   tell me sweetheart . are you having problems with charlie ? you mentioned something this morning . 
yes he 's fine too . you saw them at easter . 
well she is getting on but she 's fine . i told her you were n't feeling well yesterday . she called to find out how you are . 
what happened to you ? 
peggy ! what 's the matter ? who is it ? 
would you get that dear ? 
it was nobody . ah ... he 's a poll taker . i 'm thinking of voting democrat this year . but do n't mention it to your father . how was school today ? 
what about ? 
what 's the matter ? did you two have a fight ? . 
when did you start drinking coffee ? 
you 're looking pretty chipper this morning . 
what happened to your hair ? you have such a pretty face . why are you always trying to cover it up ? 
my little baby . do n't try to grow up so fast . 
of course dear . you 're home now . 
why do n't you go lie down for a while . 
how do you feel ? 
the nurse called and said you 'd be coming home . 
thank you . 
answer the question please . 
do you have any lesions on your face at this time ? 
and it 's your contention that when the partners were made aware of the lesions they jumped to the conclusion you had aids and fired you . 
you 've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with correct ? 
you could have infected him is n't that right ? 
is n't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you 're not so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you ? ! 
as a homosexual one is often forced to conceal one 's sexuality is that right ? 
do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks ? 
did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk ? 
while you were employed at wyant wheeler you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual correct ? 
do you need a break ? 
you 'd < u > heard</u > of aids in 1984 85 ? 
but you < u > were</u > having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985 ? 
were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there called aids and that you could contract it through sexual activity ? 
when ? approximately what year did this event take place ? 
do men have sex with each other in that theater ? 
gay < u > pornographic</u > movies ? 
what kind of movies do they show there ? 
have you ever been to the apollo cinema on sansom street ? 
in general . do you take risks in other areas of your life ? 
do you take risks ? 
thank you . 
were you recently promoted ? 
miss burton ? do you still work at wyant wheeler ? 
we object your honor . it would unfairly influence the jury . 
i 'll withdraw it . mr. beckett ? were you living with miguel alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater ? 
fact . andrew beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level . fact . he made a grievous error on a multi - million dollar lawsuit ... fact . he claims he is the victim of lies and deceit . fact . andrew beckett lied to his employers going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them . fact . he was successful in his duplicity . the partners at wyant wheeler did < u > not</u > know andrew beckett had aids when they fired him ... 
does n't seem like enough to turn back on does it ? 
leave the sled let 's go go go ! 
bring the light ! 
no we 'd never .... oh god honey you shoulda told me sooner . 
bottle - count . 
liquid oxygen canisters inside . start ripping them out . quick hits only -- try to make it last . 
but i 'm human . i know you view that as a weakness but i 'm sorry -- i < u > do</u > feel fear theirs too . goddamnit riddick -- yes . i would die for them . 
i would try for them . 
but they ... they could still be .... 
do n't do this to me .... 
i can't .... i ca n't .... 
no you see i < u > promised</u > them ... i have to ... i have to go and .... 
you 're fuckin ' with me . i know you are . 
just come with me ! 
< u > i trusted you</u > riddick . goddamn i trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race . 
what you 're afraid ? 
i promised them we 'd go back with more light . and that 's exactly what we 're gon na do .. 
you 're not leaving . not until we go back for the others . 
tell me the settlement is right there ! riddick please ! 
riddick ? how close ? 
you sure you can keep -- 
we 're just here to carry your light are n't we ? just the torch - bearers . 
how many you see ? 
get out of our way . 
what about her ? 
think about what ? 
riddick ? what the hell are you -- 
what do you see ? riddick ? 
where are the sand - cat tracks ? why are n't we still following them ? 
we can ca n't we ? trust you ? 
but i just wanted to say -- 
riddick ... was thinkin ' we should make some kind of deal . just in case you know this actually -- 
why what 'd you hear ? 
you scare me riddick . that 's what you wanna hear is n't it ? there i admit it can i get back to work now ? 
entered our minds . 
i got the quick - and - ugly version . 
they 're coming . 
then where is he ? he 's not in the hole . we looked . 
heard about it . just never seen it . 
you did this ? to yourself ? 
show me your eyes . 
what whispers ? 
tell me about the sounds . you told them you heard something right before ....   if you do n't talk to me johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull . 
what switch what ? 
let 's move .   just a detour . he 'll get us there . 
we 'll have to carry the cells ... drag them ... whatever it takes . 
awright . so maybe we 'll have enough light . 
those umbrellas the ones that mist . would they burn ?   if you got a receipt ? 
how many bottles ? 
... one cutting torch ... one handlight here two more in the cabin ... i < u > think</u > two more .... 
it hurts them . light actually hurts them .... 
christ you do n't know what 's out there ! 
cargo hold everyone in the cargo hold . lesgo lesgo lesgo . 
it 's starting .... 
this is it ? booze ? < u > that's</u > what you have to drink ? 
we can not go through there .... 
would you rag your stupid hole ! 
just shut up okay ? 
this does not help us johns . 
are you fucking high again ? just listen to -- 
i was wrong . i admit it . my bad okay ? now let 's just go back to the ship . 
stay in the light ! everybody ! stay in the fucking -- 
riddick . < u > riddick</u > . 
i do n't get it johns . what is so goddamn valuable in your life that you 're worried about losing ? huh ? is there anything at all ? besides your next hype ?   got no right to be so scared . neither one of us . 
we 're just burnin ' light here . 
because you 're 79 kilos of gutless white meat and < u > that's</u > why you ca n't come up with a better plan . 
how much ? 
how much you weigh johns ? 
for your own fear . 
oh do n't use her like that for a smoke screen . 
we can stick to the plan . if we get four cells back to the skiff we 're off this rock . 
stop it stop it stop it ! 
you coulda helped . and you did n't . 
anything < u > else</u > we should know about you johns ? christ here i am lettin ' you play games with our lives when -- 
< u > you</u > made it a problem when you let owens die like that . when you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule - team . 
and here you got two mornings every day . wow were you < u > born</u > lucky ? 
never said you were a hype either . 
you 're not a real cop are you ? just some mercenary who goes around talkin ' about the law like -- 
dancin ' on razor blades here ... 
you know he has n't harmed any of us . far as i can tell he has n't even lied to us . just stick to the deal johns . let him go if that 's what it -- 
you mean if he learns that you 're gon na royally fuck him over . 
oh this is a dangerous game you 're playing johns . 
you said we were going to trust him now . you said there was a deal . 
okay maybe that 's a < u > good</u > thing . maybe i can use him to help with -- 
he can pilot ? 
< u > get the fucking cells over here</u > johns . what 's the discussion ? 
wait for what ? until it 's so dark we ca n't even find our way back to -- 
... need those cells from the crash ship . shit still got ta check out the hull patch the wings -- 
60 years ago . 
so what happened ? where are they then ? 
15 6 - gigs here ... 90 gigs total ... other ship carries 20 - gig cells so ... five . five total to launch . 
okay that should buy us a sys - check . but we 'll need more cells . 
nothing we ca n't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts . 
thanks for the tip johns . 
what you think i 'm doin' this to prove something ? 
nobody else is going down but me okay ? 
thought you did n't believe his story . 
< u > we're gon na find the body</u > johns . christ you 're a cop . why am i tellin ' you this ? we got ta go down and find it . 
let 's just be sure . 
so why is n't it all bloody ? 
he used that ? 
ease up ease up . johns ! just tell me what .... 
like what ? 
no juice looks like it 's been laid up for years . but we might be able to adapt -- 
so now you know . 
during the landing ... when things were at their worst ... owens was at his best . he 's the one who would n't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin . 
promise me . swear to me you wo n't -- 
better keep moving .... 
no no i wanted to get away . 
probably makes it worse . dehydrates you even more . 
thought you found his restraints over there . toward sunset . 
i do n't need his life story . is he really that dangerous ? 
we just keep him locked up forever ? 
and him ? 
carolyn fry . i 'd shake hands but ... 
hey me . over here . 
johns is leaving you a gun . just do me a favor huh ? get my crewies buried ? they were good guys who died bad . 
imam . we should leave soon . before nightfall but while it 's cooler . 
ask if anyone has anything in cargo ! anything to drink ! 
somethin' knocked us off - lane . maybe a rogue comet . maybe we 'll never know . 
it 's the atmosphere . too much pressure not enough oxygen . might take a few days to -- 
and there was n't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site ! < u > that's</u > how they train you ! on a fucking simulator ! 
company 's not here is it ? 
so what we should both go down too ? out of sheer fucking nobility ? 
ca n't get my nose down ... too much load back there .... 
1550 millibars dropping 20 mb per minute shit we 're hemorrhaging air . < u > somethin'</u > took a swipe at us . 
you hear me ? captain 's dead . owens too . 
he 's dead . cap'n 's dead . christ i was looking right at him when -- 
oh no . no no no .... 
and what about the cells ? 
do what i say . please . 
do n't stop just slow down .   little more space ' tween us and them . 
imam . slow down . 
no i 'm not . but < u > he</u > can . 
they 're afraid of our light . that means we do n't have to be so afraid of them . 
i saw the cut - marks on the bones . was n't a natural die - off . 
for now . 
frightening thought . 
you were on a pilgrimage ? to new mecca ? 
some prophet guy ? 
so quiet . you get used to the sounds of the ship then .... 
i do n't suppose .... 
next time you try that mr. mitchell ...   .. do n't . i 'm warning you . 
i think you 're drunk . 
i do n't like being referred to as babe or addressed as baby . i do n't like your possessive attitude nor your hints of secret knowledge . in fact to be very frank mr. mitchell i do n't think i like you . 
please be a little more careful how you talk mr. mitchell . 
i think i 'd like to dance . 
how do you do ? 
if i change my mind . 
would you mind ? 
i 'm trying very hard to be polite about it . 
perhaps i 'd better get you straightened out mr. mitchell . you 've been rather nice to me in a couple of ways . and i 'm grateful . but i do n't think this entitles you to put me on a leash . 
i have n't been invited . 
i 'm sure you have . 
i 'm not in the mood for dining and dancing . 
not tonight . 
i 'm supposing . 
thank you . 
very nice mitchell turns . 
i do n't know . 
i really do n't know . 
is it ? i expected to go to the vancouver royal . should i have a reservation ? 
perhaps i do n't take it so lightly . 
i 'm going to vancouver mr. mitchell . 
how far does this train go ? 
i 'm afraid there 's nothing i can do about it mr. mitchell . 
no thanks i 've seen seattle . 
they might think i was running away from something . 
immigration officer ? 
how long would that take ? 
how soon can i get a plane to seattle ? 
i 'm carrying quite a large sum in travelers checks . how much of a deposit would you like ? 
i 'm miss mayfield . is mr.   campbell here ? 
do you think i was faking ? 
yes .   you .   you 're not really a murderer yet . 
if it has to be -- do you mind if i do it myself ?   oh i do n't mean with the gun . this is no trick .   when i wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either .   it 's not so hard for me as you think . i 'm not crying about it i 've been skating close to it for quite some time .   the water is cold down there--   but so is everything else .   and there 's you . 
every day of your life you 'll want me .   you 'll never get over it . every time you see your face in the mirror-- 
but the next one is murder .   first the little step then the longer step   and then the step you can never take back .   you could tell about mitchell .   you could tell about magruder -- and the detective . it would hurt but you could do it .   you could never tell about me . 
magruder does . 
and that nasty man that followed us last night .   you did n't kill him . 
yes .   yours .   you have n't murdered anybody .   you killed mitchell . was n't that an accident ?   it must have been .   if you kill a blackmailer you kill him dead -- so that he ca n't talk anymore . 
and i 'm begging for my life -- and yours . 
you 'll never make it .   you 've out- smarted yourself . 
so that i will never be found . 
i guess i 'm a little screwy .   maybe i could believe it .   should i try ? 
you - killed - him ? 
he 'll come back ... they always come back when you give them money . 
that man that was following us last night -- he did n't come back this morning .   i 'm beginning to wonder about him too .   was he really following me -- or you ? 
the money that makes you mr. clark brandon .   let 's you live in a penthouse on top of the vancouver royal .   lets you own a cruiser . lets you do as you please go where you please .   you big open - handed generous guy .   that 's the kind of money it takes is n't it ? 
what your father did does n't condemn you . 
if it was an accident you could have told the truth . 
larry mitchell found out .   so you killed him . 
including killaine ... i still ca n't think of you that way . 
funny i never thought of you that way .   you were so close too .   we were all pretty stupid about you . 
i thought you had to be back to the hotel .   to leave my -- my note . 
if you 're doing all this just for me . 
i decided i did n't want a drink ... i'm beginning to wonder . 
i can still see the shoreline . the moon is rising . 
killaine 's wise to what ? 
you leave it . 
you would n't like it .   i 've been there . 
do you have to leave the note ? 
this must have cost a fortune . 
but that 's what i 'm doing .   could n't they think of that ? 
and betty mayfield-- 
they 'll look for you . 
i was tried for murdering my husband .   guilty .   the judge set the verdict aside .   there was one man on the jury--   --but he was afraid .   they were all afraid -- of my father - in - law . that man followed me last night-- he came from him of course .   my father - in - law will never give up . never .   he promised me that .   so i came to vancouver b.c. as far away as i can get from north carolina .   and it happens all over again .   almost the same thing . almost the same way .   do you wonder about this-- 
take me where i have n't the courage to take myself . 
yes .   i 've never been very far from it for a long time .   will you do something for me ? 
that was n't why i called you .   why did i hope -- when i had n't any right to hope ? 
wrote it in the waiting room of the hudson bay store .   with somebody 's pekingese trying to climb into my lap .   perhaps you 're right .   perhaps i did n't mean it . all i know is that i 'm licked . 
i have my own warrant .   stop a minute please . 
they 're going to arrest me . 
i hated to go to that place .   i almost went to the police station instead . 
there 's another man -- right outside the booth here .   i never saw him before . 
i 'm in the hudson bay company 's store .   that man last night -- the one that followed me-- 
so have i. 
nothing matters . 
take me home -- and forget you ever saw me . that 's a silly remark is n't it ? 
no matter . there 's nothing i can do about it . 
all right -- following me . 
he was following us -- but he 's not a policeman . 
you do n't know who he is ? 
absolutely sure . 
then he 's got to be a detective . 
we walked right passed him . he 's following us . 
that man over there . he was in the hotel lobby . 
they know you here -- know your name . 
dance ? here ? 
is this the best you can do ? 
you too ?   my name is betty mayfield . i was born and i am here . message ends . that 's what i told him . he did n't like it . 
certainly not to me . 
dance ? tonight ? 
there 's a lot of night left to live through . 
what time is it ? 
that 's putting it mildly . 
bad enough . 
there 's one thing i may as well tell you . you 'll find it out anyhow . i tried to run away -- when i found him out there on the balcony . there was n't any plane . 
no thanks . 
there was n't any plane . 
go ahead ... if you want to . it does n't matter . 
that 's all there is . 
he knew the immigration officer . he eased himself in . 
on a train . he said he lived here and he offered to make a reservation for me . 
i do n't . 
no . and i 've never fired a gun in my life are n't you supposed not to touch it ? 
not with my consent strange as it seems . i do n't know how he got in . i do n't know anything . 
there is n't one .. that anyone would believe . i went for a walk after dinner down to the ocean ... alone ... i came up and went to bed . i did n't sleep very well . then there was a thunderstorm . and it began to rain . i went across to close the french door . that 's the first time i saw him out there . 
there 's one less tonight . 
you said it was n't a tragedy . 
much too late . 
no thank you . 
you 're sure mr. brandon wo n't mind ? 
do you think i do n't ? 
i hate to be alone . but i 've heard all the approaches there are ... even yours . 
i did n't say anything . 
would it make you anymore amusing ? 
you 're drinking it . 
and do you amuse the guests ? 
you 're not paying for this . it 's quite enough that you let me sit at your table . 
as i said before ... 
you do n't sound as if you liked him very much . 
what did you say his name was ? 
i do n't need it that badly . i do n't enjoy crashing other people 's parties . 
i see . 
your liquor laws .. 
i see . 
no please . 
ale . i do n't mind . 
beer ?   well all right . 
i 'd like a dry martini . very dry please . 
but i tell you --- if you 'd only understand . 
no jeff .   you do n't .   he 's not a murderer i tell you .   he;s not a murderer . 
he could have killed me a dozen times .   you 'd never have known . 
not sometimes .   always .   just because it is the hard way .   you 're that kind of man jeff . 
you do things the hard way do n't you ? 
but even if you were in love with me . 
what proper grounds ?   you ca n't be in love with me .   you hardly know me .   i 'm not in love with you . 
what are you going to do -- toss your job into puget sound ?   because i make you think of magnolias ?   i thought policeman was something like a soldier .   that his duty came first .   however much he might happen hate it . 
you 're still a police officer jeff .   i saw you send those two men away . i know they were watching me . 
what will they do to you ? 
to do what ? 
because you think your in love with me ? 
they 'll only find someone else-- who wo n't be so kind . 
i always wear gloves when i shoot people .   a bad joke -- but better than tears . 
looking for peanuts i suppose . 
jeff .   shall we go now jeff and get it over with ? 
what do your friends call you?-- the ones that know you well?--and like you very much ? 
very ridiculous . 
what does he see ? 
points very straight to her . 
you would n't even try   there must be some copper in you or you would n't be an inspector . 
i expected nothing else . 
i do n't want to talk . 
there is n't anything you can do . 
you understand perfectly . 
nobody can help me . you least of all . 
you 're a police officer . a very nice one -- but you have a job to do . i 'm a girl who 's in a jam and it 's your job to keep me there . do n't go considerate on me . i might start to bawl . 
you -- or the vancouver police department ? 
the police always do do n't they ? 
you were there when i last saw him . 
is it a crime ? 
who hasn't -- one way or another ? 
you were a galahad compared to some cops i 've known . 
we would n't have met at all . 
i 've never been to florida . 
deep blue ? i 'd call it grey - blue . 
good morning mr. killaine . i 'm sorry i ca n't give you the name of my bank -- because i have no bank at the moment .   that was a crude trick . 
why do n't you arrest me and be done with it . 
a graduation present . 
would you be satisfied if i said i shot him ? 
i 'm sorry . 
your family coat of arms mr. killaine ? 
who told you i was married ? 
it is ? 
you did n't ask a question . you made a speech . 
i 'm sorry that 's all there is . 
i was born in new york city . i grew up . and here i am . 
i do n't know her .. or particularly want to . 
oh many things .   inertia ... stalin and the cold war ... a failure of nerve .   we took the seediest most inefficient fifth of the economy into state care paid out millions for it put the same old duffers in charge .   a new broom with very old bristles .   when the tories were returned i went and sat in the bm and wrote my little book on chartism . 
did he ?   i left school and worked for the labour party .   my older brother george had just been killed in greece and he 'd been an active member .   i hero - worshipped him .   he was 25 years old ...   it was an exciting time for us those first couple of years after the war .   we thought the country was about to become a true democracy .   i can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time .   they feel betrayed .   they want to know what went wrong . 
then i began to listen to what the well - off were saying about the poor now  the war had just ended and the language was much the same as it had been before the first reform act .   a small minority thought that england was really theirs they had made it they owned it .   the rest the wage earners were foreigners outsiders intent on wrecking it all . 
shall we go ? 
hello .   anyone for a walk ?   tom is n't i can tell you . 
these are transcripts of various radio broadcasts including gaitskill 's the one they tried to stop .   you ought to have that ... 
the references are to hansard or to newspapers .   i have n't got the actual speeches now .   you 'll have to chase them up . 
we 'll see you next week and if-- 
do n't be silly .   i 'll look out some more suez material for you . you 'll be very welcome . 
she 'll be here next weekend .   why do n't you come too james ?   i 'll                        * show you the marshes properly .   if you 're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from siberia . 
it 's a pity she could n't make it up here today . 
i do worry about susan .   have you known her long ?   she has n't mentioned you . 
i think you 'll do very well . 
if you like .   but do n't be too modest james .   the citizen 's duty is to remember not necessarily to write books .   you are highly qualified .   you 're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job .   every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history .   a genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you . 
here i am lecturing you .   have some pâté . 
if we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost .   everyone must have a memory everyone needs to be a historian .   in this country for example we 're in danger of losing hard - won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present . 
to james .   i remember what it was i was going to say .   we were talking about forgetfulness .   the czech writer kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting . 
and i 'd like you to call me ann . 
since you are a friend of my daughter 's i think i 'm entitled to call you james do n't you think ? 
my husband apologises for not joining us .   it 's not too cold for you mr. penfield ? 
good .   suez was a minefield for both parties . 
i see .   are you a socialist mr. penfield ? 
it was n't much more than a pot boiler . suez was very important for our generation .   i did n't want it to be forgotten .   and that 's why i 'd like to be able to help you . but really mr. penfield i looked through my notes before you came they 're all very much out of date there 's been so much published since .   i do n't think i 'm your man . 
my first husband worked for the bbc .   i doubt if anyone there remembers him now just another long dead diligent administrator . he would have been useful in the fight to preserve the bbc 's independence during the suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about .   i became involved too .   i started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of suez . then he died and i loots the will to write it .   by the time i was over his death other books had been published and it was n't worth going on . 
he 's a little unhappy .   i hope he was n't a nuisance ? 
tom daddy would like to see you in the garden .   and will you ask betty to bring us some coffee . and remember to say ' please ' . 
mr. penfield .   i am sorry to have kept you . 
i know .   i 'm sorry . 
oh ... excuse me .   there 's nicholas . 
in your car 
he 's making plans for brighton . he thought we could travel down together . 
jeremy phoned this morning 
yes .   might .   remember you 're here to talk to my mother . 
i might . 
no .   it 's a bit of a madhouse . for some reason a lot of my mother 's friends specialise in monologues . 
well you should . 
do you think she 's invited you up for her sake or for mine ? 
did she talk about me ? 
i think we 're ready now thank you .   and how was norfolk ?   did you get on with my mother ? 
you just might . 
i bet .   thanks for the drink . 
i do n't trust anyone .   that 's what comes of working in television . 
two or three years ago i would have stayed .   and fucked you . 
i have to be up early . 
yes if you like .   call me at work . 
well you know ... 
i called you a taxi . 
damn .   they 're early . 
that must be rather nice in a way .   i mean you do n't have any-- 
it makes me weepy just to remember it .   so we were fine again and then she got married to matthew who 's a womaniser and a bit of a yob but quite nice really makes tv commercials .   what about yours . 
mummy and i we were more like lovers really or sisters .   then a couple of years after daddy died and not long after i left oxford she started seeing various men and i was furious .   i really was upset . i stopped going home .   i never phoned .   i went round telling everyone how awful her books were . and she hardly seemed to notice and that made me angrier .   then i got a job i was interested in and i started to see lots of men and i suppose i grew up a little and began to understand .   so i wrote her a long letter almost seven pages saying how sorry i was and how i was worried that we were drifting apart .   and do you know she wrote me a poem a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters . 
yes .   you 're much too old to making a drama out of alienation or whatever you call it .   you 've got to take responsibility for your own happiness .   that 's what i think anyway . 
i think you 're exaggerating .   and if you are n't you should jolly well change your job . 
and you 're at this third stage 
my real father ?   well he was a flashback . 
good theory .   but i like my mother . i have no aversions to what she does . 
and the shape of it all .   it was sort of ... shapeless . 
and i did n't like that man . 
i think it went on rather too long . 
i quite liked it .   i was n't as enthusiastic as everyone else . 
no it 's all right .   i can get a cab .   night night . 
yes that 's right .   i 'm being terribly rude .   bob ?   oh bob . this is bob tuckett .   bon was at oxford too . 
was that your chapter then ?   it was very good . 
so it 's all worked out perfectly ... 
no he was n't .   he just lowered himself into a bar stool and said ...   ' oo i do feel bad .   i ' ad three pints of lager and six onion bajees ! ' 
it 's true !   i was here last year doing a piece remember ?   i was in the bar with all these northern trade unionists and their sponsored mps .   they were all incredibly fat and beery huge trousers and braces . and so sweet .   they all stood round me like children saying ' you ! working for television ?   you 're just a young thing . '   they would n't let me buy drinks even when i told them the programme was paying . they kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying   ' oo can i ? ' 
it was incredible .   he came back made a pompous little bow and said ' my dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish . ' and he 's promised not to talk to the press . 
oh yes !   where 's mine ?   i want to look like you . 
what have you got there ? 
do n't point it at james ! 
oh no ! 
it was last year . 
we 're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools .   world history since 1945 .   twelve programmes lots of stock film . 
you 're so famous now . 
jeremy !   how fantastic . 
actually i 've been once today already .   i 'll stay here with him . 
do n't you want to walk tom ? 
tom . .. bed !   go on . 
i wo n't .   goodnight . 
fuck you johnny utah .   fuck you ! ! do n't you have a soul ?   goddamn you to hell ! 
you tell me the fucking truth johnny ... did your parents really die in a car crash ?   did they ? ! 
jesus christ johnny -- you 've been using me !   your jacket 's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing 's half out of the pocket ... oh god it 's all part of some case is n't it ? 
but you look like you been in a train wreck how 'd he just drive away ? 
so what 'd the other guy look like ? 
betadyne does n't hurt . 
johnny ... what 's going on ?   i do n't get it ... did i do something ? 
those are cold . 
you do n't have to . 
well usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration like you 're doing this for a school project or something ... i do n't know like something 's driving you .   see it 's gone .   if i did n't know better i 'd say you looked almost happy . 
look at you . 
you had enough ? 
come on .   at least no one 's gon na see how bad you are . 
swell 's here johnny .   bodhi always knows . 
i 've seen that kamikaze look johnny .   you 've got it .   and bodhi can smell it a mile away .   he 'll take you to the edge ... and past it .   hey bodhi . 
bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies . i hope you 're not buying into this banzai - bullshit like the rest of bodhi 's moonies . 
yeah he thinks he 's evolved to a higher plane of existence or something .   maybe he has .   you 've seen him surf ... that frenzy .   it seems like anger .   it 's not .   it 's the energy of lovemaking .   the sea is the woman in his life .   she 's his only true lover . 
we went out for about five minutes ... which is four minutes longer than most of them .   but you ca n't hold it against him he 's ... different . 
people are expendable to bodhi . 
catch of the day . 
he rents it for the summer .   bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around .   most a these guys ca n't keep a job .   when the swell comes they 're gone they have to ride . 
stop here .   do you agree to do exactly what i say when i say it ? 
tomorrow 6 am .   here .   if you 're a minute late i 'm gone .   and stud ... i did n't take you to raise .   i can show you a few things but after that you 're on your own . that 'll be four fifty . 
this gon na take long ? 
what is it ?   you all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing ? this is a line right ? 
i can see that .   but forget it . stick to tennis or whatever you 're good at .   miniature golf .   here your number 's 37 . 
gimme a break .   one shrimp and fries to go !   anything to drink ? 
i mean what do you want ?   what are you doing hanging around here . 
what do you want ? 
he 's not really my uncle . 
i dunno .   do thigh high leather boots go with a cocktail dress ? 
well ... i might be going out to dinner . 
you do n't know anything about me . 
it 's ... it 's not like that . 
please we hardly know each other . 
huh ?   oh ... yeah .   s'okay ?   uhm ... how 're ... business things going . 
it 's not your fault .   you 're right .   kit 's right .   but i want the fairy tale .

it was good .

why do guys always know how to hit a woman ?   right across the cheek wham so it feels like your eye is gon na explode .   what do they do take you all aside in high school and show you how ? it pisses me off ! 
it 's all just business to you . him .   me .   your life . everything 's business . 
last time i saw him he was this strong guy .   now he 's beaten . and you < u > liked him</u > . 
what did you do to him ? 
you just did . 
i know .   hey do n't mind me .   i 'm being stupid .   i 'll think about it okay ?   it 's a real good offer for a whore . 
i 'm sorry .   that 's very sweet edward and i know you mean it ...

yeah you 've been pretty tough to take .

i more than liked it . 
but do n't they have it in english ? 
if it 's in italian how will i know what they 're saying ? 
you mean besides elvis ?   i 'm a human being .   sure .   once . first time i ever ran away from home i got as far as atlanta . i met this boy .   he 'd been with his parents on their way to chicago .   they stopped at a gas station .   he went to the john . when he came back they 'd split . we sorta started looking out for each other .   aw he was sweet . and boy was he good looking y'know dark hair and eyes . the chicken hawks were on him all the time .   he hated that . sometimes we 'd find a safe place to crash nights and we 'd curl up together and we 'd talk about all these crazy things .   the two of us getting married someday . having kids .   stupid stuff . 
sorry .   you 're not paying me to ask you question like that .

hi viv .   carlos you know my roommate viv . 
then why is there fear behind your eyes ? 
i do not marry tonight . 
should i be ? 
why not ? you ca n't hurt me . westley and i are joined by the bonds of love . and you can not track that . not with a thousand bloodhounds . and you can not break it . not with a thousand swords . and when i say you are a coward that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth . 
yes i am a silly girl for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear . 
you never sent the ships . do n't bother lying . it does n't matter . westley will come for me anyway . 
every ship but the four you sent . 
every ship but your four fastest you mean . 
he will come for me . 
my westley will always come for me . 
if we surrender and i return with you will you promise not to hurt this man ? 
oh my sweet westley ; what have i done ? 
you mocked me once never do it again -- i died that day ! 
and what am i ? 
nothing you can say will upset me . 
you mock my pain ! 
on the high seas your ship attacked and the dread pirate roberts never takes prisoners . 
you can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces . 
you 're the dread pirate roberts ; admit it . 
i know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything . 
i have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream . 
he knows i do not love him . 
i never said he was my dearest love . and yes he will save me . that i know . 
i was giving you a chance . no matter where you take me ... there 's no greater hunter than prince humperdinck . he could track a falcon on a cloudy day . he can find you 
if you 'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you 'll get it i promise you ... 
to think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned . 
who are you ? 
well no we sort of skipped that part . 
i got married . i did n't want to . it all happened so fast . 
oh westley will you ever forgive me ? 
oh westley darling .   westley why wo n't you hold me ? 
we did it . 
westley what about the r.o.u.s. 's ? 
we 'll never succeed -- we may as well die here . 
what ? -- go on -- 
but how is that possible since he 's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago ? 
you ? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            58 . 
we 'll never survive . 
i will never doubt again . 
well ... you were dead . 
move ? you 're alive . if you want i can fly . 
but how can you be sure ? 
but what if something happens to you ? 
i fear i 'll never see you again . 
farm boy . fill these with water --   --please . 
farm boy . polish my horse 's saddle . i want to see my face shining in it by morning . 
i do n't care if you do or ... i want to see mary ... before she gets in any deeper ... 
not even a hunch . just hope . 
sam if she 's here ... 
sam they do n't want to prosecute they just want the money back . it was all in cash ... 
i do n't know . 
i do n't know . 
i still feel ... 
did he say anything about my sister ? 
what difference does that ... 
he said he was dissatisfied ... and was going back . 
go out there ! find somebody ask some questions !   i 'm sorry if i seem over - anxious to you . i keep thinking ... something 's wrong . i have to know what ! 
he did n't mention the money .   what he said on the phone is n't important is it ?   he was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother and he did n't ! that 's what i want you to do something about ! 
mary had been there one night and had left . 
forty thousand dollars . 
she stole some money . 
she left phoenix a week ago yesterday . and no trace until ... 
will you help us ? i think something 's wrong out there ! 
i could stand something regular . 
why not ? 
sam that old woman whoever she is . i think she told arbogast something ! and i want her to tell us the same thing ! 
yes .   but maybe this proves that bates found out about the money . 
that 's proof mary was here !   it would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to ... 
it did n't get washed down . it 's figuring ... the kind you tear up and get rid of .   some figure has been added to or subtracted from ... forty thousand . 
the bathroom . look at how clean it is . the one in our cabin is clean ... but this is clean ! 
hospital clean . 
arbogast ! sam he liked me ... or felt sorry for me ... and he was starting to feel the same about you . i heard it when he called ... in his voice a caring . he would n't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us .   unless he was stopped . and he was stopped so he must have found out something ! 
there must be some proof that exists right now ! something that proves he got that money away from mary ... some way ! 
sam if you owned a useless business like this motel ... one you probably could n't even sell ...   what would you need to get away to start a new business somewhere else ?   forty thousand dollars ? 
we have to go into that cabin and search it sam ... no matter what we 're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt . 
we should have asked for cabin one ... the one mary was in . 
someone was at that window . i saw the curtain move . 
i believe it . 
we 're going to register . as man and wife . and get shown to a cabin ... and then search every inch of that place inside and ... outside . 
you going to wait here for me ? 
i suppose ... when you were able to marry her she 'd have presented you all shiny and proper ... she always tried to be proper . 
do you know how i found out about you ? i found one of your letters ... it was a nice letter sam . 
i wonder so many things about her now .   why she never told me about you ...   funny when you think there 's an answer to everything you think you know all the answers . 
i did n't . i got a job too .   i wonder if that hurt her my not letting her sacrifice for me ?   some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you do n't let them . 
i wonder if we 'll ever see mary again . 
i wo n't feel satisfied unless i got out there sam . 
you 're not . 
all right ! then call ! at least call ! 
no thank you . it 's my problem too . 
does that mean we ca n't ... 
who 's he ? 
sam he called me when he had nothing definite nothing but a dissatisfied feeling . do n't you think he 'd have called if he had anything ... 
without calling me ? 
where could he have gone ? 
just wait here ? 
why ca n't i go out there with you ? 
sam i 'm going . 
sam ! why call when we can go ? 
an hour ! or less ! 
patience does n't run in our family . sam i 'm going out there ! 
where 's the old highway ? 
whenever i start contemplating the panic button your back straightens up and your eyes get that god - looks- out - for - everybody look and ... i feel better . 
you have an awfully nice habit sam . 
are we just going to go on sitting here ? 
sam . he said an hour . or less . 
where ... can i stay ? 
you want me to stay here ? 
i came flying up here expecting to get some explanation ... for all i know she may be trying to get in touch with me at home . i 'd better go home . 
no . i just think ... anything can be explained . but mary doing a thing like this ... i do n't know how to handle ... 
i need to ... i need to believe something . this is the first time i 've ever come up against anything i could n't ... understand . 
she have n't even called you ? 
why not ? sam is she hiding here ? are you two planning to go away with the money ? 
i ought to call the police right now ! 
no . the man whose money she ... he talked so loud and fast and i ... i should 've called the police . 
i just listened ... and believed everything they told me . ' she stole the money . ' ' we do n't want to get her in trouble . ' ' no do n't bring the police in ' ... 
yes ... i just ... did . the moment they told me ... 
not that kind ...   you men and your egos . 
i hate tears . 
look if you two are in this thing together i do n't care it 's none of my business ... but i want to see mary . i want her to tell me she 's all right and it 's none of my business . then i 'll go back to phoenix and ... 
what do you know about it ? 
mr. loomis you 're so busy being defensive that you have n't even reacted to the most serious fact of all . mary is missing . 
a good reason i suppose . 
last friday . she left work and home ... i was in tucson over the weekend ... i have n't heard from her not even a phone call . 
to begin with where mary is . do you ? 
do n't you know ? 
i do n't know where . in your store somewhere in your town ... anywhere . 
with you . 
i want to know if my sister is here . 
is mary here ? 
i 'm mary 's sister . 
may i talk to you ? 
i 'd like to be ready when he gets back . 
but what ?   is there anything so terribly wrong about ... making a decision and wanting to hurry ? do you think i 've stolen ... my car ? 
i 'd really rather not . please .   ca n't we just settle this and ... 
i think i have the necessary papers . is there a ladies room ... 
all right . 
five hundred . 
of course not . please . 
it looks fine . how much will it be with my car ... ? 
how much ? 
no . thank you . i 'm in ... a hurry . i just want to make a change and start ... 
yes it 's ... nothing wrong with it i 'm just ... 
can i trade in my car and take another ? 
i do n't need pills ... just sleep . 
were there any calls ? 
it 'll pass . headaches are like resolutions ... you forget them soon as they stop hurting . 
is n't mr. lowery back from lunch ? 
i 'm late ... and you have to put your shoes on . 
do n't miss your plane . 
i 'm thinking of it . 
i 'll lick the stamps . 
sam let 's go get married . 
i have n't even been married once yet ! 
i pay too . they also pay who meet in hotel rooms . 
you make respectability sound ... disrespectful . 
sam ! no ! 
we can see each other we can even have dinner ... but respectably in my house with my mother 's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three ! 
i have to go sam . 
you could n't be a criminal if you committed a major crime . 
can you ? 
it is tragic ! or it will be ... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax - deductible excuse for flying down deductible here ... 
i have n't time to argue . i 'm a working girl . 
this ! meeting you in secret so we can be ... secretive ! you come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and ... i wish you would n't even come . 
sam . this is the last time . 
i 've lost my girlish laughter . 
when you 're married you can do a lot of things deliberately . 
checking out time is three p.m. hotels of this sort are n't interested in you when you come in but when your time 's up ...   sam i hate having to be with you in a place like this . 
what do i do with my free afternoon walk you to the airport ? 
good night . 
very early . dawn . 
i 'd like to but ... 
i stepped into a private trap back there -- and i want to go back and ... try to pull myself out .   before it 's too late for me too . 
i 'm very tired . and i 'll have a long drive tomorrow . all the way back to phoenix . 
yes and just one time can be enough .   thank you . 
i am sorry . i only felt ... it seemed she was harming you . i meant ... 
i 'm sorry ... i did n't mean it to sound uncaring ... 
would n't it be better if you put her in ... someplace ... 
no not like me . 
why do n't you go away ? 
except you . 
she sounded strong ... 
if anyone ever spoke to me the way i heard ... the way she spoke to you i do n't think i could ever laugh again . 
you should ... mind it . 
sometimes we deliberately step into those traps . 
why do you ask that ? 
i 'm looking for a private island . 
only my share . 
you go out ... with friends ? 
is your time so empty ? 
a man should have a hobby . 
i imagine so . 
it 's a strange hobby . curious i mean . 
i 've caused you some trouble . 
i 'd like to . 
thank you . again . 
i have ? 
thank you mr. bates . 
the bathroom . 
am i that close to fairvale ? 
i want sleep more than anything . except maybe food . 
los angeles . 
i thought i 'd gotten off the main ... 
you have a vacancy ? 
now what ? 
i 'm sorry . 
is there what ?   i 've told you there 's nothing wrong ... except that i 'm in a hurry and you 're taking up my time ... 
please ... i 'd like to go ... 
of course not ! am i acting as if ... something 's wrong ? 
then i 'm free to go ... ? 
i did n't intend to sleep all night ! i just pulled over ... have i broken any laws ? 
yes . as i said i could n't keep my eyes ... 
yes .   i did n't mean to sleep so long . i was afraid i 'd have an accident last night from sleepiness ... so i decided to pull over ... 
well thank goodness that 's settled . 
yeah but they leave you plenty . 
no ? give me a chance baby . money is music in my ears and when his old man kicks off there 'll be a million dollar tune . 
i 'm hungry . i 'll eat the first child i see . and i 've an appointment with young winton at 8:30 . 
ouch ! eat ? you can do a solo if you do n't step on it . i 'm going to bow out on you . 
i ca n't convince the inner woman that we can wait . she 's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on santa claus and the other dummies . i 've only had a cup of coffee since last night . 
i 'll have it for supper .   so long . 
then marry ralph ... you 'll be the happiest couple in the world . 
he can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough . 
all right you raise the kids -- i 'll raise the roof . i 'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers than expire in a pan of dirty dish water . 
i 've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but i 've never hit one with dough . this love - in - an - attic is n't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon . 
i do n't have any affairs . what do you mean ? 
in the can .   the hoosegow ! mrs. winton 's little boy . the pawk avenue wintons you know ... and plenty of do - re - mi .   he 's in the jail - house now ... 
i met one last night ... all the money this side of peoria . 
i just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you did n't have the rent but ralph is awful sweet . 
i wondered . did he invite you to lunch or did you invite him ? 
nothing doing . this is my percentage . you birds are going to get yours . and anyhow i found this dump . 
i do n't know what he was but he made frankenstein look like a lily ! 
not a very good one i guess . he was n't like anything human . he hobbled and swayed like a monkey and the face from the glimpse i got of it in the light from the street was like an african war mask . 
how quaint . but i can go any place you can . 
whatever you are you 're the only one of it . 
listen copper get a load of this . while you 're chinning yourself on a bar rail i run down this story ... my story . consider yourself my assistant . 
do n't take my word for it . get down there yourself and give a look . 
i 'm not kidding . joan gale 's body is packed in the box in the basement and i saw the most horrible thing down there . 
the body of joan gale ! 
i 'm going to get even with you you dirty stiff ! i 'll do it ! 
listen stupid could i do anything that would possibly meet with your approval ? 
i 'm going to make you eat dirt you soap bubble ! i 'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go ! 
was there any art on judge ramsey ? 
say you 're always razzing everything i do but this is one time i 'm in . 
this one 's a story but i 'm not going to tell you what it is . every time i tell you anything it goes haywire . 
mit me kid . i 've got a classic . 
almost ! i 'll still bet i 'm right and let you write your own ticket . 
no kiddin ' ? 
what do you mean ? 
all right master mind .   but there 's something cockeyed about that joint and i 'm going to find out what it is . 
let it go . 
and it came to life and divorced you . i know all about that . now my idea is this : somebody swipes the girl 's body takes impression makes a mold produces wax figure ... bingo ! ... peddles it to this old skate down there ! 
listen jo - jo . does this mean anything to you ? joan gale 's body swiped from the morgue -- did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask ? 
just this -- i got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they have n't got a wax figure of joan gale in that line - up then i 'm crazy . 
all right you poor baboon you can guess the rest of it ! 
i asked you to keep your trap shut ! 
jim there 's a little hokey - pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th street . 
listen jim -- and if you wisecrack while i 'm talking i 'll crown you with the inkwell . 
i am right ! i know i 'm right ! 
so you can give me an argument and tell me i 'm wrong . do n't be sil kid . 
i want to see the original pictures of joan gale . 
which one is me ? the horse ? 
no there 's another point i want to iron out . 
on the square jimmy if you 'd seen winton down there -- i 'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he 's a dirty pup but he 's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ... 
nope i 'm through ! 
all right you said i was fired . well i quit ! give the assignment to somebody else . 
well that 's got nothing to do with this case . can i handle this my way ? 
or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him . 
and they never proved anything against him . 
well i wo n't work on it from that angle . 
well anyway he could n't have copped that body -- he was in jail . 
you give me a pain ! 
no i mean it . i think this kid 's entitled to a break . 
i would n't be trying beloved . i would hang him ! and another thing all this gaga about the body disappearing . eight bodies have been stolen in new york within the last eighteen months . does n't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle ? 
if this kid was some unknown soda jerker they would n't have pinched him . but he 's george winton and they 're playing him up . it 's a roman holiday for every paper hat editor in new york . 
quick watson the cookbook ! 
and how does one go about getting these human documents may i inquire ? 
well is it my fault if nothing happens ? 
what do you mean you poor ham ! this is new year 's ! 
meaning what ? 
charming . more delightful people crippled . 
where did you get the news item ?   from a little bird ? 
as i live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince . 
do n't give this to anybody else will you ? 
make it snappy colonel . 
hotcha ! saved one job ! 
what does that prove ? 
say if you 're stringin ' me old - timer ... 
they do n't suspect < i > him</i > ? 
old howard winton 's cub ? 
no foolin ' -- any suspect ? 
yes she committed suicide yesterday . that 's not news . i heard about it last year . 
i 've got to make news if i have to bite a dog .   hey kelly ! oh mi gosh even he walked out on me . 
i 'm people which the old year saw out . i 'm canned fired ! 
how 's every little thing ? 
stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner 's banquet and he says bring me a yarn . all i have to do is get a story . 
ai n't that something . the mad monk of manhattan . here goes nothing .   listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion . 
plain - clothes man .   come on slaves drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to washington ... a fate worse than death . 
he 's not a stag hound . his name is kelly and he 's a police dog . 
ralph come here a minute will you ? 
no . i wanted to do it without saying anything . i think he 's worth it . 
well i 'll tell you a secret . i kinda like the old gent and i 'm trying to build a special sunday magazine story out of him . it might help him a whole lot . but that 's a side issue -- something i do on my own time . 
i 'm after news as usual . i wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory ? 
who ? old santa claus there ? that 's easy for anyone with my sex appeal . he 's a pushover . watch me stand that old dodo on his ear . 
he might get some publicity out of it . 
do n't worry -- she 'll get used to it . 
fine thanks . 
do n't ask any questions . come on ! 
well that being the case i 'll take it up with the board of directors . hey listen aviator here we are ! 
how much money have you got ? 
oh is that what caused it ? 
it does n't usually take that long but i 'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when i met you . 
--and so determined to live that i 'm going to get out and take a taxi if you do n't watch where you 're going . 
darned if i do n't ! 
there she is ! you 'll find joan gale in that box . 
i told you what to do . drive around the corner out of sight of the house . i want to get a closer look at the place . 
all right brother . then you can go to some nice warm place and i do n't mean california . 
what ! and let every rag in town grab a red - hot story ? not so you could notice it ! now look i want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me . 
not even if it gives you a clean bill of health ? 
that 's what they 're going to ask you . 
that happens to be the truth . 
hold on hold on . i 'm trying to help you if you 're on the square and i think you are . 
well let 's get back to the case in hand . they ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue . 
you were n't going with her ? 
i see . was that all she said ? 
uh - huh . do you remember what she said ? what did you talk about ? 
hmmm . why did n't you tell that to the police ? 
your dad has stood for plenty . now let 's get down to cases . when did you see the dale girl last ? 
that 's what i said . 
listen kid . you 're in a tough spot and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry - baby stuff -- 
come on old man that wo n't do . you know you 're innocent until proven guilty . 
i think so . 
if you 're going to be indiscreet i wish you 'd be a little more discreet about it . rich men like winton love you and leave you . 
you would n't get mixed up with that little rotter would you ? 
what 's the rush ? there 's no first act . they 'll all be there and we do n't have to appear at any particular time . 
why did n't you eat last night ? 
there 's no hurry . it 's early . 
but what about lunch ? 
you think money is the only requisite . it happens that the poor people are happier . 
you would . 
i do n't agree with you . 
i do n't think you could have a real affair . you could n't care for anyone . 
did you ? where ? 
i do n't see any big - moneyed boys running after you . 
what are you laughing at ? 
i wish you would n't be so sarcastic about ralph . he 's the sweetest kid i know . 
yes why ? 
i 'm glad you told me . good night mr. burton . 
so that 's the way it is ? 
i 'd call it stupid at any time . 
are we going to have the same quarrel over again ? 
she thinks it 's funny to talk the way she does but-- 
i wo n't let you say that ! 
nonsense . she 's one of the nicest girls i know . 
but why ? she 's the best friend i 've got . 
delighted i 'm sure . 
disappoint me ? why what do you mean dear ? 
please oh please i have n't done anything to hurt you . 
ralph ! ralph ! 
let me go ! let me go ! 
oh please mr. igor i 'm terribly ashamed . i should n't have put you to so much trouble . 
i 'd love to . 
but it was really my fault . 
no -- i -- wanted to speak to ralph . we had a silly argument last night and i said something unkind . 
oh ! mr. igor ! -- i 'm so glad you 're here -- i do n't know why i should be but i was a little bit afraid . 
but i think these things are beautiful . 
we 'll be coming to the opening . 
i 'd love to at any time . 
thank you . 
so i can move on .   you too . 
i 've been dreaming about this . 
i did n't want to leave things the way we did .   not this time . 
and glow happily ever after . 
she 's in l.a. he 's in the bay area -- 
no .   i did n't .    i 'm listening . 
like now ? 
what did it want ? 
of what ? 
the buddhists have been saying that for a millennium . 
what universe are you in paul ? 
we flopped the first time out . 
why am i doing this ? 
a place you 've never been . 
could you ? 
i 'm heading out of town . 
day or night ? 
i said she is n't here . now you go home . be a nice boy and go home . 
she is n't here . and i 'm sorry but mr. hillyer does n't want her to have callers during working hours . 
she must have gone out for a walk with the children . 
this is n't punishment i do n't believe in punishment . it 's for your health . obviously you 're sick if you can act like that . 
i do n't think you are sufficiently in awe of it . get the castor oil . 
but we must respect that power we must be in awe of it . 
sex is n't ugly sex is one of the most beautiful things in life the creative power of the universe is behind it . 
now i have a plan about rose an educational plan . she 's getting better and we do n't want any more trouble --   brother you ought to hear this . 
i do wish you 'd speak to brother . it 's true he 's been looking at those horrible little books again . 
oh yes it 's thursday .   hello rose dear ...   ... my you 're ... looking pretty ... 
what 'd you say brother ? 
children children ! be quiet all of you !   the vibrations in this house are strange today . where 's rose anyhow ? 
no you did n't say that brother . 
what did you say brother ? 
stop gagging like that and putting on a show and swallow it . 
this is for your own good . when you look at negative destructive things like those little filthy comic books you are sick . here take this . 
oh brother i am so disappointed in you . you must n't look at those horrible things they degrade the human image . 
brother when i have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you 're either sick or you were up very late last night .   and you were n't reading huckleberry finn . i looked and its not in your room . now what were you doing ? 
walked in all that heat ? it 's a wonder she has n't got sunstroke . i 'll phone daddy and you go get doll baby and waski . 
all right all right . doll and waski are upstairs taking their nap you go get them and bring them down to the living room . where is the girl ? 
your impression is very reassuring brother . of course she 's had troubles poor thing but i sensed that was that the girl was like and i 'm glad to have it reconfirmed . 
wonderful . what 's she like brother ? what is your impression of her ? 
yes i think so . he adores her it 's almost pitiful the way he worships her . i just hope she is n't too much for him . 
well yes she 's happy . of course dave does n't have her life force not at all . there is n't much furniture in his house just a table and one or two chairs whereas rose has furniture coming out of the windows . 
i do n't understand it . even in the wild days she was never as late as this . 
how is she ? 
better off ? how could she ever find love and happiness if you did what you 're talking about ? are you insane ? 
rose is n't oversexed that 's ridiculous . if you 're going to talk nonsense i do n't want to talk to you at all . rose is exactly the same as the rest of us except more so . 
i ca n't believe you really meant it if i did i 'd want to die . you are n't a male monster that man is but you are n't . look me in the eye and tell me do you really want to take rose 's womanhood away from her when it 's all she has got ? 
i thought i knew you . i thought i knew you better i thought in your heart you were a good and kind man . well i ca n't believe what i 've just heard in this room . a defenseless girl depending on you for protection and you propose to mutilate and destroy her . how could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man ? 
over ... my ... dead ... body ! 
this conversation is making me a little sick . 
i 'd say about three months . are you satisfied ? 
what did you forget ? 
but she must know ... unless ... unless ... rose was there more than one person ? 
that 's why i 'm asking her who the father is . it 's the most vital question of all . who 's the father dear ? 
poor thing do n't cry rose . i know you feel awful but do n't cry honey nobody 's perfect . who 's the father dear ? 
it sounds like a farm to me . calling it a dairy establishment that 's just trickery and flummery . 
honey rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life . now i do n't think -- 
she 's just nervous and worried . and you would be too if you had no job and no place to go . 
she does look a little peaky . 
she ca n't get a job it 's a depression . and we ca n't just throw her out on the street . 
she has n't actually done anything ... 
she 's like a different person . being so sick made a big impression on her . i really think she 's learned a lesson . 
sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit .   your real trouble is that you 're anti - intellectual . the irony is women are supposed to be emotional but i never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do . 
honey dr. martinson is n't a rascal he 's one of the finest physicians in glenville . he studied at johns hopkins university . 
i do n't see how you can even think of it now . 
you do n't like him because he 's a yankee . he 's a brilliant doctor . 
honey please ... 
i 'll talk to her i 'll reason with her . 
what she does n't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people . she 's young she 's got to learn to restrain the life force that 's in her . its creative but in her case it 's too creative . 
if you mean sex you could n't be more wrong . rose likes those boys and men she has love in her heart and that is what they want . it 's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her . 
how could rose really be a bad influence on dolly ? she has a loving nature you ought to want someone like that around your children . why do you think those boys and men like her ? 
but what i said is the simple truth . and now i see something else i see more deeply into it ... 
but morals come from the heart not from rigid rules and empty laws . and in her heart rose has never hurt anyone and she never would . therefore she 's not immoral . not really . 
who is to say our morals are better than hers ?   but maybe you 're right . she could ... influence dolly ... 
well she does seem to cause a lot of trouble i admit . but she does n't mean any harm and it 'll break the children 's hearts they all love her . 
well that 's very reasonable . howe i hate to bring it up but she 's got an awful toothache we 've got to carry her to the dentist . 
it is n't her fault if she 's popular ... what ? 
just a moment ! you are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends not while there is breath in my body ! 
and when i try to talk to you seriously when i try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts what do you do -- you mock me ! 
yes ! yes i say that to you they were boys ! boy friends of rose chat 's what they were and why should n't she have boy friends ? do you want her to be unnatural ? do n't you think she 's human the same way you are yourself ? it 's the south that 's what it is the south with its horrible traditions of slavery and crime and the oppression of women who are just as good as men and just as human ! 
scoundrels ? they were n't scoundrels they were just boys . 
you certainly are ! she has an awful toothache look at her jaw it 's all swollen . 
i will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl . 
well it is n't rose 's fault boys and men like her . you ca nt blame her for that hon . 
that sulky boy was here again this afternoon . i was almost scared he would n't go away . 
well time will tell wo n't it ? 
well i wish you 'd stop criticizing and picking on her . 
why should n't she go out and have boyfriends ? 
is she all right ? 
what time is it ? 
be kind to her . she loves you so much .   in a perfectly proper way of course . 
but that 's a wonderful quality not a bad quality .   have a little patience with her . she 's such a good - hearted little thing and tries so hard . 
he and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children . 
i do n't think you understand her . it is n't sex she wants it 's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it . 
well i admit that outfit is n't very modest . but she does n't mean any harm she just wants to attract attention . 
i wish you would n't pick on rose and tease her like that . of course her clothes are silly but she 's ignorant naive she does n't know any better . 
rose you and brother wait in the car . i want to speak for a moment lo mr. hillyer . 
you 're not having lunch ? 
well it is a little tight . but it is n't as bad as all that . no one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place . 
i 'm serious . we forget he 's just a child . i wish you 'd speak to him . 
why they wo n't either . she looks pretty . and i wish you would n't pick on the poor girl all the time . do n't listen to him rose you look pretty even beautiful . 
what 's the matter hon ? is anything wrong ? 
i think about what i 'm doing all the time and i 've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody . besides i want you to stay and help rose with the dishes the poor girl is n't feeling well . 
be nice to rose . she 's never had a real home . 
i 'm not in the fourth dimension --   -- you are in the fourth dimension when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control . as blake said if god had doubt the sun would go out . 
hotcha character . if i had to live with your cynicism i would n't want to live at all . what you ca n't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive not negative . 
hope for the best ? i do n't understand all this skepticism . i thought you liked rose . 
there are no flies on rose i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
and she 's such a good - hearted thing there is n't an ounce of harm or malice in her . 
honey she 's perfect . she works all the time and she 's wonderful with the children . and they love her even brother likes her though he wo n't admit it . i think she 's just perfect . 
oh . did you say something ? 
slow hon . but at least i can concentrate now that rose is here . 
yes it 's so nice i thought i 'd work outside . 
it is n't the fourth dimension . to you it 's the fourth dimension maybe to me it 's simply the truth . 
buddy sex do n't mean a thing to me . it ai n't nothin' but a mosquito bite .   i 'll tell you a secret . girls do n't want sex buddy girls want love . 
a saint just like your own mother . she 's up in heaven right now her and lunette there ai n't no doubt about it . 
boy did i get sick of rabbit . but later on after momma died and daddy was n't doin' nothin' but drinkin ' i sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew . you know i ought n't to of told you about what daddy done when i was a child . until them rabbits ruined him he was a real good man buddy . 
he thought he could sell 'em but nobody but country folks eat rabbits buddy and they ai n't got no money . we had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves . every dern one and it took about four years to eat 'em all up . 
yep we had 'em in orange crates all over . it was daddy 's dream . he was goin' to get rich raisin ' rabbits . it was what killed daddy . he did n't drown hisself till a long time later after momma and lunette died of typhoid but it was them rabbits what killed him . 
did you know when i was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits ? 
i guess i 'll work as a waitress buddy . i done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know but i ca n't stay here no more . why did you get rid of your rabbits buddy ? 
take a little walk with me huh ? 
makin ' homes for purple martins huh ? we had 'em on the farm . they 're the prettiest things . that 's what i wish i was a bird . just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun . 
hi buddy .   how 's my sweetheart who never told on me when i was bad ? 
i do n't want to know ... 
buddy i 'm scared i 'm scared ! 
oh buddy they 're gon na cut me all up ! they 're gon na cut my stummick all open i 'll die ! 
i ai n't neither . listen here buddy besides all his vast medical knowledge he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he 's got some real interestin ' ideas . 
well i like him . i used to be afraid of doctors but not any more . why he could operate on me any old time and i would n't even be scared . 
he 's got doubts about hisself and that 's the saddest thing of all . would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him ? 
you do n't know the bedside manner that man has got . why it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin ' in his bag like he 's gon na cure me which he did of course . and even more important he loves me like a patient i mean the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin ' to my heart beat . 
oh he 's so kind so gentle inside and so unhappy with that rich wife who does n't understand him her being a southerner and everything and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts ! 
but i do n't know who they are . 
i got an awful toothache . 
well he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day . but i do n't know who he is buddy i really do n't . 
you 're my sweetheart . 
did your momma really give you castor oil ? 
i have a knack for designing clothes . but i had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook . 
buddy mr. right is out there somewhere and i 'm gon na find him ! 
well ill tell you this . i have learned a lesson tonight . i was n't gon na run around but when i start botherin ' your daddy and worse robbin ' a cradle i got ta face the facts of life .   tomorrow mornin ' i 'm gon na get myself up and go out . 
oh buddy you do love me ! i knew you did knew it all the time ... 
buddy i have to ask you as bad as i 've been please have pity on me and do n't ruin me by telling them what i did . i know it was bad it was bad and dumb . but mostly it was dumb i did n't mean you no harm i 'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that 's the truth . i love you . but they 'd think i did they 'd think i was awful they 'd despise me and hate me ... 
i hate to turn on this light you daddy 's awake downstairs but i have to take the chance .   buddy please do n't tell on me . 
i sure hope you do n't .   i got ta get outta here good night . 
buddy you would n't tell nobody would you ? 
no . no i 'm all right .   oh god what have i done ? i have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell !   i must be crazy a child like you . oh god oh lord . this is awful this is terrible i got ta get outta here ! 
you would n't understand .   oh god i must be outta my mind . what would your momma think ? 
no . no you 're not hurting me .   but i think you better quit it . 
i must be outta my mind . buddy quit it . 
you better quit that . 
well nothin' . 
buddy you 're just a child . 
well you 're sweet but you do n't really love me . 
of course you ca n't ! i 'm ... i 'm shocked at you buddy real shocked ! now you be quiet or i 'm going back to my own bed ! 
no ! you ought to be ashamed of yourself astin ' such a nasty things a child your age ! 
well now that is just too bad ! curiosity killed the cat . 
why buddy shut your mouth ! what an awful thing to say and where did you get any such idea as that anyhow ? 
most men would n't do what he done . if they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- i guess to hell they do just like a dern rabbit . ' course later they 'll tell her she 's no good when they done the same thing their selves . they 're a bunch of monkeys . i like 'em but they 're a bunch of monkeys . 
there ai n't none in your daddy . you know what happened has just made me love him all the more . i not only love him i respect him i admire him . 
you know buddy sometimes i ca n't figure you out at all . you can be very nice but like your mother said there 's an evil streak in you . 
who would want to do such a thing as that ? 
do n't mention it . 
all right that 's enough .   you 're just a child and would n't understand it but that type of thing can stir a girl up . now lie back and we 'll talk . 
' course it does . 
well are you satisfied now ? can we just lie and talk huh ? 
you don ' t need to know that . it 's none of your business . 
buddy you do n't realize it but what you 're doing is n't nice . 
buddy what 's come over you ? a child like you askin ' such things . 
no you ca n't . and i 'll tell you this -- he scares me . as kind as he is he scares me . you ca n't fool around with him not with that man . and boy i sure better not try nothin' like that with him again he 'll fire me . 
you know that daddy of yours is the funniest man the things he says you never know what 's going to come out of his mouth next . 
buddy quit that you 're just a child you 're not supposed to be interested in such things . 
ha ha ha that 's some idea a cantaloupe . 
what did you expect ? 
i fell madly in love with him when he called me rosebud . you know that first day when i come and he said i looked graceful like a capital letter s and called me rosebud ? i fell madly in love with that man right then .   but it 's a lost love buddy . he 's a good man and wo n't have nothin' to do with me . 
promise not to tell doll ? -- or nobody ? buddy it 's your daddy ! i 'm so much in love with him i am out of my mind ! 
why it has just made me ill buddy . i 'm sick . i do n't want to eat nothin' i do n't and me i got a good appetite that ai n't nat'ral for me . i 'm ill . 
buddy i was horrible . i ca n't tell you who it was but do you know what i did ? i sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know a child like you . why i let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and i let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers ...   but to get back serious to what i was sayin ' it is not only buddy the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so ... 
it 's so terrible i ca n't tell you . oh buddy you do n't know how it hurts to have a broken heart what a terrible feeling it is and i 've had a broken heart so many times . men i do n't understand them i ca n't figure them out and they break my heart that 's all . i ca n't find mr. right buddy i ca n't find him no matter how hard i look all i find is a whole pile of mr. wrongs . but this is the worst ever because it was n't his fault . it was my fault oh yes my fault i was bad -- oh god i was bad you would n't believe how bad i was . 
i thought i 'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to . as a child i never had no room all to myself we were awful poor . buddy ... i have got a confession to make . 
buddy i am wandering in a wilderness lost .   i just feel awful . do you mind if i get in bed with you for a little while ? 
buddy you are in one of your evil moods i do n't want to talk to you . i 'm going out and sweep the patio . 
i do n't hear you . i just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away . 
i did n't hear you . i did n't hear that . 
what terrible thing in cave springs ? 
your daddy is a wonderful man i 'll say that . he 's the best and most kind - hearted man in the world .

toons are n't given imperfections . 
oh ... well i ... i just had to see you . 
hello mr. valiant .   i rang the doorbell but i guess you could n't hear it . 
last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir .   maybe that 's what he was after ? 
what if this mixture do not work at all ? shall i be married then tomorrow morning ? 
be not so long to speak i long to die . 
if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help do thou but call my resolution wise and with this i 'll help it presently ! 
are you at leisure holy father now ? or shall i come to you at evening mass ? 
romeo i drink to thee . 
farewell . god knows when we shall meet again . 
no madam . we have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow . so please you let me now be left alone and let the nurse this night sit up with you . for i am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business . 
o god!--o nurse how shall this be prevented ? what sayest thou ? hast thou not a word of joy ? some comfort nurse . 
o sweet my mother cast me not away . delay this marriage for a month a week . or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim   monument where tybalt lies . 
what ? now . st. peter 's church and peter too he shall not make me there a joyful bride ! 
madam in happy time what day is that ? 
o god . did romeo 's hand shed tybalt 's blood ? o serpent heart hid with a flowering face . was ever book containing such vile matter 's so fairly bound ? o that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace . 
well thou hast comforted me marvelous much . go in and tell my lady i am gone having displeased my father to father lawrence to make confession and be absolved . 
speakest thou from thy heart ? 
i have . 
here 's such a coil ! come what says romeo ? 
where is my mother ! how oddly thou repliest ! your love says like an honest gentleman where is your mother ? ' 
i ' faith i am sorry that thou art not well . sweet sweet sweet nurse tell me what says my love ? 
but all this did i know before . what says he of our marriage ? what of that ? 
how art thou out of breath when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath ? is the news good or bad ? answer to that ; 
i would thou hadst my bones and i thy news : i pray thee speak . 
o honey nurse what news ? nurse ? 
by and by i come : -- to cease thy strief and leave me to my grief : to - morrow will i send . 
i uh by and by i come -- but if thou mean'st not well i do beseech thee-- 
three words dear romeo and good night indeed . if that thy bent of love be honourable thy purpose marriage send me word to - morrow by one that i 'll procure to come to thee where and what time thou wilt perform the rite ; and all my fortunes at thy foot i 'll lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world . 
madam i am here . what is your will ? 
romeo . what 's here ? poison . drunk all and left no friendly drop to help me after . i will kiss thy lips . happily some poison yet doth hang on them . thy lips are warm . 
o god i have an ill - divining soul . methinks i see thee now thou art so low as one dead in the bottom of a tomb . o fortune fortune . be fickle fortune for then i hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back . 
then window let day in and let life out . o think'st thou we shall ever meet again ? 
it is it is ! hie hence be gone away .   o now be gone . more light and light it grows . 
that light is not daylight i know it i. it is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to mantua . therefore stay yet . thou needest not be gone . 
wilt thou be gone ? it is not yet near day . 
come gentle night . come loving black - browned night give me my romeo . and when i shall die take him and cut him out into little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun . o i have bought the mansion of love but not possessed and though i am sold not yet enjoyed . o tedious is this day as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them . 
i will not fail : ' tis twenty year till then . 
romeo ! at what o'clock to - morrow shall i send to thee ? 
a thousand times good night ! exit above 
i gave thee mine before thou didst request it ! 
what satisfaction canst thou have to - night ? 
do not swear : although i joy in thee i have no joy of this contract to - night : it is too rash too unadvised too sudden ; too like the lightning which doth cease to be ere one can say ' it lightens . ' sweet good night ! this bud of love by summer 's ripening breath may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet . good night . 
do not swear at all ; or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self which is the god of my idolatry and i 'll believe thee . 
o swear not by the moon the inconstant moon that monthly changes in her circled orb lest that thy love prove likewise variable . 
thou know'st the mask of night is on my face else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak to - night fain would i dwell on form fain fain deny what i have spoke : but farewell compliment ! dost thou love me ? i know thou wilt say ' ay ' and i will take thy word : yet if thou swear'st thou mayst prove false . o gentle romeo if thou dost love pronounce it faithfully : 
if they do see thee they will murder thee . 
how camest thou hither tell me and wherefore ? the garden walls are high and hard to climb and the place death considering who thou art if any of my kinsmen find thee here . 
art thou not romeo and a montague ? 
' tis but thy name that is my enemy ; thou art thyself though not a montague . what 's montague ? it is nor hand nor foot nor arm nor face nor any other part belonging to a man . o be some other name ! what 's in a name ? that which we call a rose by any other word would smell as sweet ; so romeo would were he not romeo call'd retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title . o romeo doff thy name and for that name which is no part of thee take all myself . 
romeo o romeo ! wherefore art thou romeo ? deny thy father and refuse thy name ; or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love and i 'll no longer be a capulet . 
ay me ! 
you kiss by the book . 
then have my lips the sin that they have took . 
saints do not move though grant for prayers ' sake . 
ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer . 
good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much which mannerly devotion shows in this ; for saints have hands that pilgrims ' hands do touch and palm to palm is holy palmers ' kiss . 
sir a ring my lady bid me give you . 
where is my lady 's lord ? 
i come for my lady juliet . 
and from my soul too . else beshrew them both . 
faith here it is . i think it best you marry with this paris . o he 's a lovely gentleman . i think you are happy in this second match for it excels your first ; or if it did not your first is dead -- or ' twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him . 
then hie you hence to father laurence ' cell ; there stays a husband to make you a wife 
have you got leave to go to confession to - day ? 
o lady dear ! are you so hot ? henceforward do your messages yourself . 
your love says like an honest gentleman and a courteous and a kind and a handsome and i warrant a virtuous -- where is your mother ? 
lord how my head aches ! what a head have i ! o my back ! other ' other side -- o my back . 
well you have made a simple choice ; you know not how to choose a man : romeo ! no not he ; though his face be better than any man 's yet his leg excels all men 's ; and for a hand and a foot and a body 
what haste ? can you not stay awhile ? do you not see that i am out of breath ? 
i am a - weary give me leave awhile : fie how my bones ache ! what a jaunt have i ! 
[ within ] juliet ! 
[ within ] juliet ! 
i bade her come . god forbid ! juliet ! juliet ! juliet ! 
go girl seek happy nights to happy days . 
nay bigger ; women grow by men . 
nay he 's a flower ; in faith a very flower . 
a man young lady ! lady such a man as all the world- -why he 's a man of wax . 
thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er i nursed . 
o she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps and then on romeo cries and then falls down again . 
sir . ah sir . death the end of all 
if ye should lead her into a fool 's paradise as they say it were a very gross kind of behavior as they say : for the lady is young ; and therefore if you should deal double with her truly it were an ill thing and very weak dealing . 
his name is romeo and he 's a montague ; the only son of your great enemy . 
madam your mother craves a word with you . come lets away . 
i do n't know .   i was thinking ... maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire that sort of thing . 
only the stupid ones .   cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets .   besides i 'm not ira no more . 
you go shoot me if you want vincent but you 'll be dead before i hit the ground . 
well i do n't ! 
i do n't know . 
of course . 
very good .   now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid . 
is that right ? 
coordinate all you want but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me .   are we in sync on this vincent ? 
i drink what every civilized man woman and child in the world drinks : guinness . 
budweiser ?   you talk to me of beer and you 've the unbridled gall to mention budweiser in the same sentence ?   that 's not beer !   christ it 's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss . 
best beer in the world known to man or god . 
some places not all .   italy for instance they 're serious about their food .   but try bloody britain anywhere in the u.k. you do n't get much fancier than a deep - fried bar egg .   food 's not our thing you see . 
that 's why you were riding with him . 
and you believed me ?   but it was n't my people who did it . 
and then ... 
which leads us to ... 
the deal ?   the deal is we leave for nice at first light . 
and who are you ? 
the name is deirdre and i 'm running this show . 
it 's good to see you 've all got such faith in our little undertaking . 
no seamus .   i heard you the first time . 
you 're thinking with your gun seamus and not your head ... 
you better be careful seamus before something happens a plastic surgeon ca n't fix . 
they 're good ! 
not yet ... 
you lose them ! 
that 's him . 
they 're part of the team .   one of them 's the guy i told you about . 
would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there ? 
not to me you know that . 
so you thought that maybe i 'd grown too attached to this charade i 've been playing is that it ? 
and what 's that supposed to mean seamus reilly ? 
when we 're done with this i want to do for that one myself . 
come off it sam -- if we were n't friends already we would n't be here now would we ? 
alright ?   it 's bloody fucking freezing in here ! 
bloody fucking hell ... 
where do you get off saying word one ? all the time pretending to be one of us it 's the same thing we were doing seamus and myself .   and here you are so high and mighty like you 're so different from the rest of us . 
i 'm a patriate . 
well if it is n't mr. interpol himself .   i ca n't believe i misjudged you like i did . 
that we 're too stupid to trace his calls . 
i bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using it was in his contract .   cost a nice penny too especially that goddamned phone : gregor had expensive tastes . 
exactly .   gregor he was the russian 's man .   it was my people came up with the idea for this run but the russians who had the capital to finance it .   gregor he was their insurance and i was ours . everybody else was supposed to be neutral .   gregor must 've got to swede ... 
i do n't know ...   well i do n't !   it 's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you .   but i do know who we 're working for .   my people and the russian mob . 
just business . 
i better be getting that . 
exactly .   and last night i wanted to be with someone who was just like me . 
look sam do n't take it the wrong way when i tell you we wo n't be doing this again . 
i probably do .   but for the time being i 'm willing to forget about it ... 
nobody 's saying they do n't . 
that 's right . 
i still am . 
i feel as if i 've wandered onto the set of enter the dragon .   could you teach me to do that ? 
the two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information and instead you went to fucking war ... 
you were a soldier were you ? 
he 'll kill me anway sam shoot though me and kill this fucker . 
do n't do it sam ! 
that fucking figures ... 
where 's the case ? 
alright gregor i 'm ... 
now then let 's run through it one more time shall we ?   what 's your job ? 
but would you stake your life that 's the question ... 
you sure about this ? 
good because it cost enough .   there 's cheaper phones by far than that one man : you better fucking use it . 
from here on in you want something you pay cash for it : no credit cards no bank accounts are in place : ten percent up front the rest when the job is done .   you .   what do you do and what should we call you ? 
not likely .   once yeah i was -- but there was n't an inch of profit in it and i 'm a cash oriented girl if you take my meaning .   i 'm a hired gun same as the rest of you and that 's all any of us needs to know about the other . 
you know i do . 
i do n't believe it . 
do you wanna tell me what that was all about ? 
yeah i guess you 're right .   it 's just ... all so sudden ... 
i do n't know .   my friends ... 
i 'm not sure why .   it 's just i 've never been anywhere else ... 
can you rely on how much they said you 'd get ? 
when do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out ? 
i do n't know booth . 
how are we going to do all this ? 
a satellite dish ? 
i love you . 
so do i. 
it 'd have to be switzerland to make sure dwayne never finds us . 
i hate it when you talk like this .   go on . 
i used to think he was something once ...   i was eighteen i did n't know any better and he had something steady to offer . 
he does n't slobber he just snores . and i told you we haven't ... done anything in over a year . 
i know . 
it 's ok booth it 's no big deal . 
he started digging through my closet something he never does . 
i told him i bought the lingerie as a surprise .   i do n't think he suspects anything but now you know if he mentions it . 
well i ca n't let you down now can i ? 
and i 'd end up a widow in two ways .   let 's forget it .   i 'll just be a little more careful next time . 
let 's not get into this again . i know him .   if you said something he 'd take it out on me . 
booth .   do n't .   it 's nothing . it 's not worth it .   remember what happened the last time ? 
he 's not he 's ... 
dwayne got a little tipsy is all . he does n't handle pressure well .   it 's over . 
you got me something ?   what 's the occasion ? 
i 'm in here . 
ok .   i love you . 
are you sure you 're ok ? 
oh .   you coming by tonight ? 
what 's wrong ? 
it was all over the local news . dwayne was there acting all official . 
heard you had quite a night . 
get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours ... 
has he ? 
he 's irresponsible . 
there 's an atm on speedwell avenue . 
what for ? 
dwayne please calm down ! 
dwayne put the gun down -- 
it certainly is ... 
no dwayne you go ahead and relax have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the tv and come upstairs and pass out .   and do it all over again tomorrow ! 
well i got the tires rotated i went shopping and i made dinner . 
do n't you want to hear about my day ? 
just trying to be civil dwayne . 
i did n't say that .   you did . 
that has n't stopped you before . 
i 'm saying you 're about as romantic as a bag of sand . 
it was going to be a surprise ! 
i ca n't hear a word you 're saying ! 
i do n't know ... 
thank you honey .   are you sure you do n't want it ? 
well i do n't know -- 
do n't you want it ? 
this whole place ? 
that 's great earl ! 
well what do you know !   an air conditioner . 
and what happened ? 
you do ? 
are you hungry ? 
i tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent . 
did they ever find out who they were ? 
people have been asking me about that story in the paper .   i told them you were the first person on the scene .   they were asking me for all the details . 
how 's work ? 
is that the mail ? 
i did n't know you were coming . 
the real question is where are the plates ?   if we can find the plates we can stop the whole operation . 
they use an optical transfer ink from india that burns red -- the real ink burns black . 
in 1959 the united states was very friendly with the shah of iran .   we wanted his oil so for the shah 's birthday the government gave him a gift -- a u.s. treasury intaglio press .   the only one to ever leave the country . five years ago ricky tan bought that press on the black market . 
it 's much more than a counterfeit .   14 out of 15 world banks ca n't tell the difference .   the paper is crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on u.s. intaglio presses . 
they think i 'm a crooked customs agent . 
look i 've been working this case for months now ... 
we need to get out of sight .   come down to my suite . 
i 'm an undercover agent for the united states secret service . 
you see no bomb .   now stay away before i throw you both in jail for obstruction . 
i 'm sure because this is my friend 's yacht .   and it 's his party . 
well i 'm very tempted .   it 's such a beautiful yacht .   what 's it called ? 
el capitan ? 
this is your ship ? 
i do n't think so . 
isabella molina from san juan .   that seat is taken . 
now you know . 
i 'm fine . 
i 'm asking for real now -- will you help the secret service ? 
dip me ! 
the secret service almost busted reign at his casino in macao but the place burned down before we could move in . 
if i 'm wrong then my cover is blown . 
behind me is the soft count room .   we 're pretty sure the plates are back there . 
look over there .   that 's the eye in the sky room . 
you move well . 
i 'm undercover .   i had no choice .   you have to trust me . 
i need your help . 
put your arms around me . 
yes .   they 've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars and there 's only one way to spot a fake . 
it was n't hard to spot the fakes until this past year .   then tan got hold of one of a kind swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills . 
no .   it 's a sample .   you guys ever heard of the superbill ? 
i know who you are inspector lee . 
how about a lift home ? 
look at me ! my dress is ruined . i look like shit . 
we saved the girl and got the bad guys did n't we ? 
you do n't like it ? 
yeah if you 're superfly . 
wait a minute . i 'm not riding in that . 
it 's called a dress . 
this is my city . i 'm a cop . i 'll find em . 
jesus ... what do you want ? 
you made a fool out of me ! in front of the fbi ! 
you got a lot of guts calling me . 
well .. i would n't want to be in the way . 
ok . well ... make us proud .   and be careful . 
well ... listen if you need any help you know back up call me ok ? 
they put you in charge ? 
with the fbi . what do you think i 'm talking about ? 
what 's wrong with that ? 
no ... what ? 
the feds ? ! 
last night 's as much my fault as yours .   if he 's gon na put the blame on anybody -- 
carter just because you saved my butt does n't mean it 's yours . 
where 'd you get it ? 
good . that 's standard military packaging for plastique . get a look under it . 
i 've got news for you .   no amount of sugar and water is going to turn like graham into something you want to take on a picnic . 
i 'm not running . 
you do n't understand this guy . 
at the wedding ?   you invite him ?   bob do n't you realize he 's writing another article about me ? 
bob -- are you making friends with this man ? 
what is he up to now ? 
of course . 
of course . 
i 'm really sorry that i hurt you brian . 
weird .   like after all those years you would remem-- 
god ... of course .   i 'm sorry -- i mean i 'm ...   brian -- i 've got to go .   the man 's a lunatic but i know exactly where he 's going next . 
good one !   thanks . 
and what did you say ? 
what did he ask ? 
what ?   you talked to him !   did you tell him we dated before you were a priest ? 
he 's here ! ... he 's here ! 
it 's hurting . 
okay -- have a seat ... gently carefully . 
i borrowed it from this guy i know . so ? 
they 're mine .   i 'm turning in my running shoes to you . 
i did n't .   and you being the one at the end of the aisle did n't just fix that . 
i think so ... when i was walking down the aisle ?   i was   walking toward somebody who did n't have any idea who i really was .   and it was only half the other person 's fault because i had done everything to convince him that i was exactly what he wanted .   so it was good that i did n't go through with it because it would have been a lie but you -- you knew the real me . 
i wanted to talk to you about why i run or ride away from things . 
it 's something i 've always wanted to do . 
i 've been making friends with your cat .   is it okay that i 'm here ? 
so we 'll ... 
i 'm okay with that . 
and the church . 
yes you ! 
to who ?   are you asking me ? 
i love you too . 
me either . 
okay .   so ... what uh ... what just happened ?   just now ?   jus then ?   in there ? 
about a minute ... ? 
i kissed him back . 
come on it 'll give you a great view . it 's perfect .   hey . 
no .   no -- actually let 's make ike the pastor . 
yes i do ! 
that 's called changing your mind . 
what ! ? 
every one of those times i was being supportive .   something you wo n't understand . 
brian told you that ? 
i already explained about that . 
that was very interesting research george was doing ! 
it 's fun !   it 's high . 
i had it under control .   now they feel sorry for me . 
you humiliated me ! 
excuse me ? 
where did you disappear to ? 
yes it is .   and it does n't mean anything . 
yeah .   it 's kind of nice . 
wrenches .   my dad 's gon na love that one . 
first i have to find some tools .   i need a half and a nine - six - tenth . 
your filter 's clogged .   this takes unleaded . 
watch your leg dad .   i 'm so tired of this . 
no -- i 'm cleaning an attic .   i would n't attempt the impossible . 
no .   you take it . 
it was in the attic .   it was jus sitting there gathering dust . 
ike ... hi grandma . 
you know there 's no ... 
what was that ?   i ca n't order   my eggs without sarcasm ? 
i 'll have the same . 
fine .   the newspaper 's upside down . that 's better than fine . 
even with everything that 's happened i 've still never been married and i still deserve a beautiful dress . 
maybe you should ask her some time . ever thought of that ? 
you do n't know . 
now that 's romantic .   a proposal like that and you did n't find eternal bliss ? what went wrong ? 
so ?   is that what you said to her ? 
what do you mean ?   it was incredibly romantic ! 
it was one of the most wonderful moments of my life .   cal ripken even applauded . 
he 's an entomologist !   i thought it was very unique . 
still sweet . 
what an incredible chauvinistic observation . 
no i 'm not afraid .   just ... maybe someday . 
maybe someday . 
i think so . 
it 's a birthday present for my cousin . put your finger in . 
six - fifty . 
seven - fifty . 
because i think you 're writing on spec and with a first person interview you might actually sell that thing . 
oh but making up the facts as you go along is ethical ?   actually i meant you .   you probably got severance or expenses or both .   i 'll take your check . no credit cards . 
my point is that one again you 're getting it all wrong .   that wo n't improve your reputation any and it 's not very flattering to me either .   so i 'm going to give you a chance to write the truth . 
you 're welcome .   your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction .   your observations are distorted ungrounded an incomplete . you must be very proud . 
how do i do it ?   i 'm not that beautiful . 
you misinterpret everything .   we 've all been friends our whole lives .   but that 's the types of relationship you would n't understand . 
you 've been here for three minutes . what did you do to her ? 
he is not ! 
give me that ! 
grandma made me the cutest outfit .   i ca n't wait to show it to you . 
we think so . 
without oxygen ... 
despite what you think i do n't do it on purpose .   and i have no intention of doing it again . 
i 'd love to stay and chat but i 've got to get back to work .   i still have my job . 
you 're going to be very disappointed . 
did something happen to make you care about reality ? 
you have one ? 
nervous ?   not at all !   no .   i 've never been more certain in my life .   except -- i am having all kinds of weird dreams . 
well instead of a haircut how about a wash ?   you know get all that city grit out of it . 
i hope you have a different angle . it 's pretty much all been covered . 
thank you .   you still think that he was .... 
what are you talking about ? 
no i 'm just going to head home . 
i 'm just finishing up too . 
no sauntering down the aisle .   just make time .   let 's just get there . 
you and your lucky geese .   you always see geese . 
he 's not coming .   watch .   he 's not coming . 
... i do n't even want to talk about the luau .   what 's this ? 
yep .   i want him to be front and center and to watch everything . 
i have n't seen him in twenty - four hours . it just gives me the creeps a little bit . i 'd feel better if i knew where he was . 
lighten up what ? 
thanks .   will you fix my hair ? 
it 's only funny at camp birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt . it 's not anymore . 
i think you 're right .   is there anything i can do to make it up to you ? 
peggy there 's distinct possibility that i might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up .   despite that i love you and i can promise that i will no longer flirt with cory and i beg your forgiveness . 
but i 'm weird . 
but you have n't lost your mystery ! you 're very mysterious ! 
i 'm going to kill myself . 
on anything male that moves ?   as opposed to anything male that does n't move ? 
thank you .   do you think i flirt with cory ? 
there he is .   snoop doggy - dogg . 
ya think ? 
that 's what he says but if he thinks that i do n't realize he 's writing another article then he 's an idiot . 
okay he 's on base .   can we talk about my life now ?   -- ike 's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that i was never serious about gill blah blah .   he 's totally out to get me . 
she 's the boss . 
i did n't even need to change this gasket just put in a little hydraulic fluid . 
yes i 've seen it .   and i have to say it 's the rudest and most offensive ... joke anybody 's ever played on me ! 
no it 's humiliating and you 've been doing it since i was a kid .   i do n't like it .   stop .   you may not like having a daughter with problems .   but guess what ?   i do n't like having a father who 's drunk all the time .   i 'll eat in my room . 
no .   it 's my life . 
just stop it .   do n't say another word like that . 
thank you dad . 
his name is skipper dad ... steady . 
i 'm not exactly having fun either ... steady . 
not this one .   this one 's on me . 
yes rubbing your ears is very soothing . cory does that to me when i hyperventilate . 
his hair ... any color . 
bob is making her visualize the ceremony . 
oh sure .   that was a long time ago . see she 's not a man - hater at all . she 's very supportive of men ... 
this game is pretty important to him . he made all - stars in high school you know . 
no she 's talking about your hair . 
yep .   maggie -- someone to see you . 
and you are ? 
peggy phleming .   not the ice skater . 
no about her getting that asshole from new york fired . 
it 's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview maggie . 
are you a reporter ? 
quick .   very quick . 
wedding .   wedding .   you just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row . 
want to go to butch 's for a drink or something ? 
you okay ?   i 'm closing . 
let 's go . 
not eight ... 
see this is a mature relationship . she 's really found it . 
it 's for the bell . 
what happened at the luau ? 
he 's going to be the pastor ? 
would it ? 
this party is for you and bob .   get your mind off the reporter . 
lighten up wahine . 
you 're right .   it 's not funny now . maybe we both grew up . 
something that brings warmth to my heart .   duckbill platypus . 
i 'm not worried about you and cory or cory and me or even that you 're irreversibly screwed up .   but maggie you 've been like this since we were kids .   and i think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people 's feelings maybe it 's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own like bob if he 's the one . 
no .   you 're quirky .   quirky and weird are two different things . 
no .   i 'm weird .   weird and mysterious are two different things . 
i know .   i think sometimes you just sort of spaz - out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves . 
good morning to you too .   you look good . 
he looks better with that stuff out of his hair .   he 's an attractive man . 
not that he does n't deserve to get fired ... look !   cory 's going for second ! ... sneaky ! 
it 's probably because you got him fired . 
for what reason ?   some personal satisfaction ? 
hold on -- nobody interviews maggie in here unless they 're getting haircut . 
stop it .   when you talk like that i get turned on and it frightens me . 
you 're a goddess ! 
so -- mag -- you 've seen this huh ? 
no you tell her . 
you turn it on you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time . 
you take the microwave ? 
how about ... you 're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way . 
you do n't love me is that it ? 
is there somebody else ? 
i hope i do n't have to pay for that piece of information . 
but it 's on the water . 
boats .   all anyone talks about is the wind .   is it up is it down .   i ca n't live with a man who only talks about the wind . 
boats .   you go out in them . you come back in them .   i hate them . 
i hate boats . 
tell me he 's living in squalor . tell me everything he has is being repossessed including his filthy dented mobile home . 
you okay ? 
oh walter .   i do n't deserve you . 
i 'm not at the top of the empire state building .   i 'm here . 
i told you .   nothing -- 
yes .   but it was n't really .   it was just ... 
i do n't know what to say about it walter .   it was a form of temporary insanity .   but i had to tell you about it because -- 
walter there 's something i have to tell you -- 
it 's so beautiful .   it 's just what i would have picked out if i 'd had every ring in the world to choose from .   you see what i mean .   there are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises but i am not one of them .   surprises are highly overrated . 
i do . 
do n't hate me but i love this pattern . 
well i did .   and you know what i think ? i think that it was almost ... too perfect . 
about forever . 
i am .   i was just ... i just got ... i think i got nervous .   it 's normal right ? do n't you ever feel nervous about you know ? 
you go . 
and then i 'll see you in new york -- 
not for the kind of place i want to do .   i wo n't be in chicago that long . 
i know .   it makes no sense at all .   thank god my life is in place . 
becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was rick which meant he was cheating on her .   she was completely hysterical .   then it turned out the woman lived in duluth . 
i got ta go .   i 'll see you at work .   walter you scared me .   do n't ever do that again . 
oh it 's just becky she 's having trouble with rich again .   hold on becky i 'm going downstairs . 
i do n't think so . 
it 's delicious trust me . 
we will ?   the symphony ?   okay .   i 'll take you to the russian tea room for pelmeni . 
go for a walk in central park -- 
walter i 'd love to -- 
happy new year . 
do n't be silly .   i 'll just be ten minutes behind you . 
how will i get back to baltimore saturday ?   oh god i forgot my present for your stepmother -- i took it inside by accident . 
even when you were young ? 
i love you walter .   did anyone ever call you anything other than walter ? 
they loved you .   i told you they would love you and they did . 
is that all right with you ? 
if he eats one tiny piece of a nut -- 
he 's allergic to everything do n't worry about it -- 
they 're going to love you . 
i hope he does n't get out his slides . 
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world -- 
-- because irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he did n't -- 
-- who 's married to -- 
we 're going to the rainbow room and the symphony tomorrow night . 
no i 'm not . 
it does n't mean anything .   it was written before i went out there .   before the ho . 
i 'm going to run back to walter 's arms if he 's still have me . 
made for each other . 
well it 's the same woman .   and he was crazy about her .   what is this ?   this is from seattle . 
i saw her .   she looked just like this -- 
it 's a sign i 've watched this movie too many times .   i 'm so stupid .   from the minute i listen to that stupid program on the radio i 've been a complete jerk . 
he said hello . 
that was nothing compared to this humiliation nothing . 
you know that dream where you 're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you ? 
good night . 
thank you .   i love you . 
is this crazy ? 
that 's not what i mean .   i 'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him .   i am . 
i could n't do it .   how did i get here ? 
i thought i would look into doing a story about those radio shows . 
i always wondered about that too . 
i know . 
listen to this i love this part -- 
and then you left him ? he lost weight there and you left him ? 
that 's impossible .   a guy ca n't -- 
you never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet . 
good .   perfect .   i 'll be in new york with walter i can squeeze it in . 
i do n't know .   i mean what if i never meet him ? what if this man is my destiny and i never meet him ? 
i should say something in this about magic . 
i 'm going to marry walter .   i just have to get this out of my system . 
they knew it .   time distance nothing could separate them . because they knew .   it was right .   it was real .   it was ... 
actually he sounded nice . 
that 's what she called him on the show .   because he ca n't sleep . 
nothing 's with me . 
what was what ? 
there 's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true -- 
about what ? 
no .   not remotely .   i just want to find out about him . 
i 'll tell you the truth i heard this guy on a call - in radio show and i might not marry the person i should marry because i 've become obsessed with him . 
no no no it 's more like who is he does he have a sense of humor is he nice -- no forget nice i 've got nice -- 
no i know that part -- 
she has a pattern of getting involved with losers ... once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus . 
i need to know about him because ... he 's involved with my sister ... 
that 's what i 'm going to do . i 'm going to go home .   i quit .   laurie i quit .   i 'm going back to baltimore .   how does a blonde do a high- five ? 
i want my money . 
i know . 
i know . 
hi jonah .   sam .   and who is this ? 
come on jonah -- 
how am i going to explain this to walter ? 
this is a grotesque violation of this man 's personal life but never mind -- 
perfect .   sandbag the father . 
thank you tom .   i feel so much better just having blown this off . 
i know i know .   i do not want to move to seattle .   but what i really do n't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing i could have done something . what do you think ?   it 's just cold feet is n't it ? everyone panics before they get married did n't you ? 
i do n't even know him .   but i 'm having all these fantasies about a man i 've never met who lives in seattle . 
but when you met her did you believe she was the only person for you ? that in some mystical cosmic way it was fated ? 
i mean why did you get married ? was it all fireworks and trumpets and -- 
i think i 'm going crazy tom . i really do .   are you happily married ? 
it 's a sign . 
like ... clockwork . 
mom we already ... 
it was n't a sign .   it was a coincidence . 
oh please .   destiny 's just something we 've invented because we ca n't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental . 
it is is n't it ? you make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life . 
it 's silly really .   i mean i 'd seen him at the office obviously i 'd seen him he 's the associate publisher and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat which of course he was allergic to and i got his lettuce and tomato on white . 
you 'll love them .   we 're going down to d.c.   tonight to be with them christmas morning . 
i know .   he 's wonderful is n't he ? 
granny 's dress .   oh mom . 
it 's probably just the flowers -- 
walter and i are engaged ! 
it 's me ? 
sure you do . 
i love the symphony . 
what are your plans in new york ? 
you 're going to miss the train . 
what about the letter ? 
so he ca n't write .   big deal . i mean verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble . 
so i mailed your letter . 
this is a photo of hair . 
you do n't know who she was annie -- 
it 's a sign -- 
but he saw you right ? 
i love that dream . 
you were standing in the middle of the street ? 
i love you too . 
no .   that 's the weirdest part about it . 
okay .   good .   goodbye . 
you told a lie and got on a plane . 
did you talk to him ? 
you 'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it . 
the kid is on .   you 've got me listening to this garbage . go on turn it on . 
turn on your radio ! 
do you think at the end of the movie when she 's in the wheelchair they can still do it ? 
men never get this movie . 
plus he fell in love with a temp . 
can too . 
he lost all the weight ... there . 
your destiny can be your doom . look at me and rick . 
you are .   you 're losing your mind .   what about walter ? 
and this woman is a writer ! that 's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers . 
it sounds like the name of a mattress store -- 
... movie .   that 's your problem .   you do n't want to be in love .   you want to be in love in a movie .   read it to me . 
you 're a basket case . 
oh ? oh really ? now we 're getting down to it . 
and now 2000 women want his number .   the guy could be a crackhead a psychopath a flasher a junkie a transvestite a chain - saw murderer or someone really sick like rick . 
what 's with you ? 
what was that about up there ? 
it 's not true but it feels true . 
whatever it is . 
you should write something about this . 
you do n't believe in signs . 
so you 'll get married in a new dress . 
well fine fine .   fiddle da dee .   and how 's it working ? 
of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department so do n't be worried if it takes a while -- 
i knew we would be together forever and that everything would be wonderful just the way you feel about walter . walter .   it 's quite a formal name is n't it ?   one of the things i truly knew was that your father and i were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack i believe you call it -- 
magic .   it was magic . 
you know . 
i was in atlantic city with my family .   cliff was a waiter . he talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the steel pier .   i 've probably told you this a million times but i do n't care .   and then he held my hand .   i was scared .   all sorts of thing were going through my head .   but after a while i forgot about them .   at one point i looked down at our hands and i could n't tell which fingers were mine and which were his .   and i knew . 
then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread ? how many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna ? 
destiny takes a hand . 
how amazing . 
how did it happen ? 
are his folks nice ? 
i notice these things are back in fashion .   oh honey .   he 's a lovely man annie . 
the historical society wanted this and i never would give it to them -- 
we 'll move them -- 
everybody ! annie has an announcement -- 
why not ? 
what was it that made you know ? 
what are you going to do sam ? 
do you think there 's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife ? maybe even more ? 
we 've been talking to -- well let 's just call him sleepless in seattle and we 'll be right back after this break with listener response < u > your</u > response to the things we 've been discussing .   the number to call is ... 
and i do n't want to invade your privacy -- 
why not ? 
have you had any relationship since ? 
good .   how long ago did your wife die ? 
i think it 's hard for him to talk to you about all this . maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better . 
dr. marcia fieldstone of network america . 
i 'm not selling anything .   your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife . 
hello sam this is dr. marcia fieldstone on network america . 
i have no doubt that you 're a good dad .   you can tell a lot from a person 's voice .   but something must be missing if jonah feels that you 're still under a cloud . 
fair enough . 
i 'm sure he wo n't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him . 
well i think i can help a little more if i talk to him directly . 
is he home right now ? 
you want me to talk to him ? 
why not ? 
and you 're worried about him . 
i 'm sorry to hear that jonah . 
where 's your mom ? 
you do n't like the one he was now ? 
got me there .   what 's your christmas wish jonah ? 
no last names jonah .   hello there you sound younger than our usual callers .   how come you 're up so late ? 
yes . we will light the candles . 
they are singing for me . 
hush ... not a word about the cake hear ? 
later . when i finish the ironing . 
no estellita . 
with ramón it 's ... pride . i spoke out of the bitterness in me . and he was hurt . 
good . come in we 'll work it out . sit down sit down . 
he ca n't drink this milk . it 'll make him sick . he 's on a formula .   i was a fool ! i should n't have kept him with me . 
no . no . i ca n't . if ramón ever found me on a picket line ... 
to the mine ? 
what are you saying ? 
and if you ca n't understand this you 're a fool -- because you ca n't win this strike without me ! you ca n't win anything without me ! 
whose neck shall i stand on to make me feel superior ? and what will i get out of it ? i do n't want anything lower than i am . i 'm low enough already . i want to rise . and push everything up with me as i go ... 
no you do n't . have you learned nothing from this strike ? why are you afraid to have me at your side ? do you still think you can have dignity only if i have none ? 
charley 's my friend . i need friends .   why are you afraid to have me as your friend ? 
i do n't know . but i can feel it coming . it 's like ... like a lull before the storm . charley vidal says ... 
ramón were not getting weaker . we 're stronger than ever before .   they 're getting weaker . they thought they could break our picket line . and they failed . and now they ca n't win unless they pull off something big and pull it off fast . 
you mean you 're ready to give up ? 
it 's a lot to them . they 'd do anything to open that mine . 
whose funeral ? we 're doing all right . there has n't been a scab near the picket line for three days . 
but you are needed . especially now -- with most of the other men away . you 're captain of the stand - by squad . 
ramón -- you ca n't . 
where are you going ? 
no . we ca n't ca n't go on this way . we ca n't go back to the old way either . 
tell me . 
but you wanted to talk . tell me . 
that meeting only lasted ten minutes .   the first night i 'm home and you run to the beer parlor . what is it ? ca n't you bear the sight of me ? 
i waited up till midnight . 
yes . to plan for the picket line tomorrow . 
all right but later . i 've got a meeting now . 
no no ... the sheriff had enough of us . we drove him crazy . 
no no ... we would n't do it . 
we raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in . 
i 'm okay . but it 's nice to be home . 
okay . then tomorrow i take the kids with me to the picket line . 
i 've had them since the day they were born . 
i 'm going back tomorrow . 
anglo husbands can also be backward . 
no she wants to be there .   and there 's mrs. kalinsky . 
yes i do . there 's ruth barnes . 
but the motion passed . it 's ... it 's not democratic of you to ... 
it 's not fair ... i should be there with them . after all i 'm the one who got the women the vote . 
ca n't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time ? 
i do n't want your dead body . i do n't want you back in jail either . 
let them take it ! 
what makes you so sure ? 
you are no good to me -- in jail . 
what were they saying ? about you ? in there ? 
he 'll have it good . some day . 
he was born fighting . and born hungry . 
have mercy on this child ... let this child live ... 
it 's nothing . just a little catch ... 
forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me . 
was it expensive the beer ? 
no no ... 
i did not mean to weep again . why should i weep for joy ? 
never ... never ... never ! 
if i think of myself it 's because you never think of me . never . never . never ... 
all right . have your strike . i 'll have my baby . but no hospital will take me because i 'll be a striker 's wife . the store will cut off our credit and the kids will go hungry . and we 'll get behind on the payments again and then they 'll come and take away the radio ... 
what has it got me your union ? 
i see . the men . you 'll strike maybe for your demands -- but what the wives want that comes later always later . 
what 's more important than sanitation ? 
forget it ? i chop wood for the stove five times a day . every time i remember . i remember that across the tracks the anglo miners have hot water in pipes . and bathrooms . inside . 
i 'm sorry . the fire 's gone out . 
where you going ? 
i listen to it . every night . when you 're out to the beer parlor . 
we 're only one payment behind . i argued with her . it is n't right . 
i do n't want to leave you . 
danny it 's not what you think . 
i do n't want to . 
what is it ? 
really i do n't want to . 
they would have killed you too . 
no . i want to know what the hell is going on . 
what 's wrong danny ? 
why not ? 
i been that way ever since . 
from day one .   i was a breach birth . they tried for hours to turn my little butt around . but i would n't let 'em . 
it 's not that easy . i just got a raise . i need the money . 
he knows where i work . 
i need my paycheck . 
we been through that . 
please open the door danny . 
it 's me . 
you think you 're the only one down here with a sad story ? 
what are you hiding danny ? 
there you go again . you 're nothing but false notes . 
you 've got a comeback for everything do n't you danny ? you use 'em like some sort of shield . 
what is wrong with you ? 
yes . why do you find that so hard to believe ? 
this has nothing to do with him . 
you really need to lighten up . 
i do n't want anything . why are you so suspicious ? 
is that how you play ? 
and you admire that ? 
like you ? 
never heard of him . 
trust me . we 're safe . 
do n't worry . he 's out of town . 
what happened to your eye ? 
i ca n't . i 've got a kid .   she lives with my parents .   quincey knows where they live . 
why ? they do n't hold him for more than a day or two . 
because he 'll kill me . 
fuck you . 
i ca n't leave . 
you do n't understand . 
i ca n't . 
who the fuck are you dr. joyce brothers ?   i hate the son - of - a - bitch . 
it 's not that easy . 
go ahead . 
oh he 's a keeper all right . 
do n't worry he 's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now . 
could be worse .   oh sorry forgot who i was talking to . 
that bad huh ? 
what about the guy on the very bottom ? 
oh god . 
jesus i look like a raccoon . 
i understand . thanks anyway . 
why are you doing this ? 
that is so unfair . 
here it comes poor tom . 
quit feeling sorry for yourself tom . it gets old . 
just admit you 're wrong . 
i wanted you to ask back there .   you know before you got us lost . 
look at that place . it 's creepy . 
you think that 's a good idea ? 
tom quit fucking around . 
you mean like the donner party ? 
why did n't you just ask for directions back there ? 
no .   right here on the beach .   come on . let 's do it . 
tom let 's spend the night here . 
it 's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch . 
and you 've got wiener breath . 
i was talking about miles . 
and he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it . 
a virtuoso rendition .   tom van allen is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of miles davis ' haunting moody piece . 
no no he 's not . 
how can you how can you say that ? 
you 're trying to get me to say something that 's why you 're telling me all of this . 
what 's the profile ? 
pardon me ? 
i 'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that i worked for my entire life .   i do n't even care .   i met this boy over the summer and i i ca n't see him because of this i ca n't talk to him i ca n't talk to my father about ... i wore these clothes i thought i thought that if i looked right and if i acted right then someone would talk to me .   but i look awful and i feel awful could you could you please talk to me ?   be a little decent . 
i do n't know what to say to you except goodbye . 
you 're right . 
i 'm so ashamed dad . 
no i will .   i do n't want to leave something out because i know i can say anything to you .   you 're a liar and a thief . 
no .   i told you everything you lied to me .   i would have done anything for you . 
i trusted you .   i stood up in court five years ago and i picked you . 
you let me believe you .   you knew you were guilty and you let me become a part of it .   god how ... how could you ... 
no but you stole from them . 
yes i ... 
you stole from them you lied to me .   how do you think that 's supposed to make me feel ? 
what am i supposed to think ? 
but i found the money . 
swear to god . 
swear to god i need to know the truth . 
dad did you do it ?   did you take that money ? 
dad are you okay in there ? 
if i pick it up we 'll only get back together . 
dad i love him . 
dad in a million years i would never give him a pen .   what 's wrong with having some fun ?   i like him . 
dad you and i have talked about this .   lloyd and i have talked about this .   believe me this is well - covered territory . 
unbelievable .   this is a nightmare . 
i like him a lot . 
dad why are you acting this way ?   is this because of the other morning ? 
you 're not listening to me . 
it does n't feel right to me .   i i do n't even have the right luggage yet . 
but listen if i had a friend in the same position i would tell her to delay a year . 
dad maybe i should n't go with all that 's happening to you . 
dad no .   but i did n't want any problems so i decided not to sleep with him . 
dad yes .   and i 'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now . 
i know that . 
i 'm fine . 
dad i 'm so sorry .   i know this is a bad time . 
i was irresponsible i should have called . 
dad i 'm sorry . 
which they did and every once in a while on a commercial you can hear me scream . 
okay i give up . 
and then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around . 
i knew how planes flew but i was still a little nervous . 
lloyd was such a gentleman .   he was funny and nervous and strange and i met people that i never would have met before then i blew it .   i called him basic .   can you believe i did that ? 
dad i 'm so glad i went .   goodnight . 
do n't do this to me . you 're too good at making me nervous . 
god i 'll have to go on a plane . 
i won ? 
are you kidding ?   you 're not kidding ?   you 're not kidding ! 
tell me is it bad news ? 
i love you dad . 
stop it stop it stop it . 
everybody thinks i 'm a priss . 
i was standing up there and looking at all the people and i felt like they did n't know me .   i mean maybe i should n't have taken all those courses out of school because everybody thinks i ... forget it . 
oh god i do n't need all these presents .   i do n't know any kid who got a car i mean ... 
god that 's ... this is ridiculous . 
what are you doing ? 
dad you have to teach me to suture this weekend . 
well it 's almost over .   we 've gone to school together for three years and we 've been through a lot .   but with that training out of high school gone what 's going to happen to us ?   we all know what the answers are .   we want to be happy go to college own a car maybe raise a family .   but what if that does n't happen ?   i have i have to be honest though i have all the hope and ambition in the world .   but when i think about the future the truth is i am really ... scared . 
alright no more i 'm going to save it . 
i did n't think anyone would get it . 
you like it ? 
having taken a few courses at the university this year i have glimpsed our future and all i can say is ... go back . 
well it 's almost over .   we 've gone to school together for three years ... i might cut that part out . 
you will ? 
if they ask you questions and they probably will ask you questions would you please say something nice about him mum ? help him ? 
i just wonder what could be more important than what 's going on with dad . 
this is me telling you about me . 
mom please ? 
i know . 
nobody thought we 'd do this .   nobody really thinks it 's going to work do they ? 
not right now thanks . 
good to know . 
i 'm fine . 
i love you .   please i love you . 
i love you .   how many more times do i have to say it ? 
i love you . 
everything else means nothing to me .   if i hurt you again i 'll die . 
my father 's guilty .   he lied to me he lied to everybody .   i just left home ... i need you . 
i 'm sorry . 
oh shit . 
do n't be mean this is hard for me too . 
lloyd i love you okay ? 
you have corey and dc .   i have my dad . 
just my dad . 
no that 's fine .   she 'll tell everybody but that 's fine . 
why did you tell corey what happened ? 
no i did n't . 
lloyd we shared the most intimate thing two people can share . 
no i do n't i do n't . 
i think that we should stop going out on dates . 
no .   we decided that we 're friends .   i mean i know it 's a terrible word ... 
no no . 
we decided ... 
yeah uh - huh . 
we 'll see . 
well i need to study and ... 
i think that we should spend some time apart . 
how can i look at you and say this ? 
i know .   lloyd let 's not start putting things on this level . 
i do n't know what you 're going to say but i think that ... 
no we do n't have to say it . 
it was wonderful . 
uh - huh .   it was wonderful . 
your letter came yesterday . 
here are some blankets .   this is a good song this is a really good song . 
then why are you shaking ? 
you 're cold . 
you 're shaking . 
yes .   are you shaking ? 
this is so noble . 
oh .   i was putting the ... 
am i wrecking my car ? 
i 'm doing alright . 
friends with potential . 
be friends ? 
i just ca n't have any social life right now . 
i just do n't want it to get too heavy .   i feel really overloaded . i have this theory of convergence that good things always happen with bad things .   but i know you have to deal with them at the same time but i just i mean i do n't know why they have to happen at the same time i mean i do n't know why i just wish i could work out ... am i just babbling ?   do you know what i mean ? 
well ... just meet her . 
she 's amazing .   she 's ninety - three she 's a writer and i told her about you . 
you have to meet bess . 
okay bye . 
stop by later . 
i think that 's ageism and that 's that 's being prejudiced against people because they 're old .   maybe their mouths do n't work as well as yours . 
come on . 
i know you think my job is strange .   you do n't like old people do you ? 
i usually have a break after the dinner service if you want to stop by . 
i had a checklist in mind .   i thought that if babies were on the plane the plane could n't crash .   but all the babies were crying and i thought they knew something i did n't . 
you think so ? 
yeah i 've had it forever .   i used to have this thing with marking the words that i looked up . 
or or i could always wear this one . 
then call me later . 
then call me tomorrow . 
i only have something like sixteen weeks . 
no i 'm serious . 
so what 's your job this summer ? 
you 're a great date .   i 've never really gone out with someone as basic as you . 
you know what ? 
thanks .   but either way it still feels ... 
well my parents split up when i was thirteen and ... god i actually had to ... i went into court and i had to choose between the two of them .   so i chose my dad .   it just felt safer that way you know ? 
yeah but that 's an old story you do n't want to hear it . 
yeah .   i 'm so glad we did this . 
yeah but i feel like i fit in for the first time you know ? like i just held them far away from me and they did the same to me . 
nobody knew me before tonight . 
thank - you . 
he does this every year ? 
so it 's an honor ? 
oh .   um would it be terrible if i wanted to go home early ? 
what are these ? 
would you hold this for me ? 
i 'll go . 
i 'll go . 
actually i think that i ... 
well not monumentally . 
saturday i have some things to do around the house . 
yeah i have to help my father . 
yes .   things are pretty hectic right now but thanks . 
oh thanks but i 'm busy .

thank you very much . 
hi .   you called me ? 
thank - you .   the real world . 
the world is full of guys .   be a man .   do n't be a guy . 
no you 're not a guy . 
lloyd you have to understand her family is being ripped apart . like you and she were ripped apart .   like joe and i were ripped apart . 
what does it say ? 
lloyd send her flowers write her a letter .   something . 
you 've got to do something special .   you 've got to make a statement . 
lloyd listen to me .   everything has changed .   you 've had sex . no matter what you might think nothing will ever be the same between you two .   you might be sixty .   you might be walking down the street and you 'll talk to her about something whatever . but what you 'll really be thinking is ' we had sex ' . 
did you sleep with her ? 
see you .   bye .   bye diane . 
you are such a great person lloyd .   i 'm a good person but you are a great person . 
okay i got it . 
that 's just so embarrassing . 
c'm on lloyd . 
lloyd give it up . 
brains stay with brains .   the bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques . 
diane court does n't go out with guys like you .   she 's a brain . 
then what 's love ? 
going out as friends . 
that 's not even a scam . 
but you never had a first date . 
that 's unlikely . 
what ?   i 'm sorry talk . 
and above all just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever ... 
you 've got to show her respect you 've got to show her that you 're not like joe ... 
look at his face he did the deed . 
he 's got that nervous talking thing .   i told him not to speak . 
meaning that she made the second date a family audition which is the kiss of death for lloyd . 
lloyd is doomed . 
i 'm sorry .   it 's just you 're a really nice guy and we do n't want to see you get hurt . 
diane court does not realise how good - looking she is . 
well where mr carroll uses the word ' love ' i look for a new word . 
i do n't feel anything . 
if you were diane court would you honestly fall for lloyd ? 
it 's too much pressure it 's not his crowd . 
well you do n't have to be so dramatic about it . 
i wrote sixty - three songs this year .   they 're all about joe and i 'm going to play every single one of them tonight . 
its over cotton . 
please cotton dont do this . 
did it ? 
cotton there is n't one day one hour one minute when i 'm not reminded of what i 've done . i have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what i feel in every vein of my being . and i wish i had in me what you need to hear but i do n't think the words exist . 
how ? what could i say that would make a difference ? i took away a year of your life -- how do i apologize for that ? 
i did that . 
what do you want from me cotton ? 
i do n't think that 's a good idea . 
but nobody wants to see that . itll never go . theyll rewrite you . you dont want that . 
youre not going to get away with this . 
no . this is a set up . 
it 's not you derek . i do n't trust myself . i tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men . 
no it 's not . 
what about your film ? is n't it due next week ? have you even started it ? 
my screwed up life should n't have to bleed onto my friends . 
this is exactly what i do n't want . 
i 'll get my jacket . 
the forbidden subject . 
where have you been ' ? you missed my shining moment . i won the macaroni sundae binge . 
it 's okay . i can peddle toilet paper . 
do n't ask what you can do . no coddling . life rolls on status quo . 
dewey there 's no such place . 
no . this is nothing dewey . i 'll be okay . go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo - happy existence . 
dewey i 'm completely equipped with mace alarm whistle keyring knife a degree in defensive combat ... 
you go it 's all stairs i can take it from here . 
no . i will not crawl under a rock . this is a fucked - up world and people kill people all the time . i 'll just get used to it . 
yeah right . 
it 's a copycat killer i knew this would happen . that fucking movie . 
oh my god . how could it happen ? 
three hundred people watched ? nobody did anything ? 
oh my god . 
but who would operate your camera ? 
my morn was a delta . 
it 's hell week . i 'm pledging the deltas . 
yeah well ... you are the definition of mixed emotions . i really should hate you ... i see your movie 's getting good reviews . 
i 'm okay . people magazine wo n't stop calling but other than that ...

it 's not a good idea hallie . 
no hallie i 'm not gon na take you down too . i 'll be alright .

hello ?   hello ? 
guys guys i 'm sorry but no way . 
thanks joel . 
you 're not allowed to ask that . 
this has nothing to do with me joel . there 's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the us at any given time . i ca n't control that . who 's hungry ? 
do n't panic . 
i 'll be right back . 
he 's after me . 
listen to me . we 've got to get help . the killer 's here . 
thanks for the movie randy . 
i have this button i press . see ? it insulates me . she mimes an air lock valve . 
i guess gale 's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive . 
me too . randy . me too . 
do you work for her now ? 
what do you want ? 
do n't do anything stupid cotton . you 've come to far . 
cotton i 've done nothing but help you . 
you have a right to be angry . 
did you do it ? 
but youll never get away with it . 
what are you going to do ? 
jesus youre just as whacked as your son . 
youre all in this together ? 
look i know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win . okay ? i 'm not interested in the scoop anymore . excuse me . 
no i do n't . 
why do n't you ask them ? 
home -- where he lives . 
tons and tons . 
good for you . 
do i know you ? you look familiar . 
well you know i 'm dear to the subject matter . 
fair enough . 
look i 'm sorry about the face . 
let 's go . 
jesus christ ! 
maybe they never got here . he could have taken her anywhere . 
this is all too familiar . 
ssshh ! what was that ? 
shit ! it 's both of them . the first murders were to throw us - using the same names as woodsboro . but they 've moved on- -they're getting closer to sidney . they 're not looking for a himbry or a tatum to kill . they 're looking for the new tatum . 
and joel 's pre - med . 
.. and as lonely as i am ... 
dewey you and i would never make it . 
can we turn the light on ? 
what are we looking for ? 
billy had alibis too . 
he 's already got ta be a part of sid 's life . what do you know about this derek ? 
if you were truly a copycat would n't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could ? 
not good . how you doin ? 
and deep down i 'm a good person ? make no mistake dewey i 'm a shit . 
mood swing . i 'm manic depressive . 
i 'm sorry . i do n't know what else to say except i 'm sorry . 
i never meant to imply ... 
you have every right to be upset . 
oh dewey i 'm sorry . 
and an explanation is of course out of the question . 
i see you read the book . 
i 've been trying to reach you but you have n't returned ... 
hello dwight . 
no wait ... 
you 're getting obvious . 
what do you mean ? 
what do you want from me ? 
oh -- a god complex 
where are you ? 
what do you want ? 
i do n't play games . 
who are you ? 
who is this ? 
sid i 'll come with you . 
it 's good to see you involved . 
it seems to be causing a stir . what 's with the toilet paper ? 
i 'm sorry . 
sidney . hello . how are you ? 
the safety what ? fuck that ! 
i dont know . 
yes goddammit ! 
someones trying to kill me . i need the police . 
enter cotton weary . 
finish what my son started . 
where do you think he got it ? mental illness is heriditary . who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother ? he was a smart kid but children need parental guidance . 
i couldnt believe you didnt recognize me . you even interviewed me for your book . 
parents are always responsible . it all starts in the home . 
already did . he 's the perfect suspect do n't you think ? 
and are the police sure about that ? 
where is sidney 's father ? 
hi gale any leads ? 
i took your vulture seminar seminar at berkeley last year . 
and much richer as a result . 
what are you doing here ? i thought you had retired from field reporting ? 
job hazard . debbie salt stringer-- newsweek . answer a few questions ? 
tuitions expensive . 
wait a sec derek . we forgot to flip . 
we have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings . 
so we found a compromise . 
.. so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience ... 
a twist ending if you will . 
and now drum roll please ... 
a verdict and premiere all on the same day . i love it . 
of course not . who wants to ? whats the point if we dont get caught ? wheres the glamour in that ? 
youre the one who got away . 
we have our own website now . we dedicated a whole page to you . 
he sent me the cutest e - mail . 
he hates oliver stone . 
ever see natural born killers ? well derek and i have this whole mickey / mallory - woody harrelson / juliette lewis thing going on . 
yeah you look quizzical yet pensive . 
i got it .. 
he seemed harmless . 
randy somebody . 
she 's got guards with her . 
i did n't say she was alone . that guy-- from her home town showed up . they went off together . 
damned if i know . she ditched me . 
so you 'll relieve me at 2:30 ... 
you 're going to get it . you know what happens . 
do n't do this . 
he tried to kill her first . 
too bad . 
shut up . mickey you and i can take her late evening . 
i have rehearsal . 
i got . i got it . friday the 13th part 20 . 
oh sid youre sounding desparate . i guess fearing death makes one anxious . 
i 'm the only one who can cut him down . 
can i come with her ? 
it 's okay to break girl . you shatter if you have to . 
no no i had n't planned on going it 's just mickey will be pissed . 
we 're missing the sig ep party . 
no girletta i do n't leave your side . 
who is that guy ? 
that was good . 
i 'll cover you through rehearsal . derek when do you get outta docu- drama ? 
what about rehearsal ? 
okay you 're sure about skipping calculas ? 
time to change numbers again ? 
knock yourself out . 
what are these movies ? ' amazombies ' ' space psychos ' ' creatures from thesan andreas fault ' ? 
it may be maureen reynolds -- 
well if you wo n't work for me will you work for the president ? 
well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you . 
does the name maureen prescott sound familiar to you ? 
i 'm gale weathers author of the woodsboro and windsor college murders and anchorwoman for total entertainment . maybe you 've heard of me ? 
he killed milton ! the killer 's   inside there ! oh god !   dewey ! dewey 's in there too ! he needs medical help ! he 's hurt ! 
boys boys why do n't we compare our gun calibers later ?   the issue is maureen prescott ! 
ok look .   we all know that this has something to do with ' stab 3 ' .   what we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about maureen prescott . 
four ? there are five . 
but we know who killed maureen prescott billy loomis and stu macher .   i mean they even told sidney how they did it ! 
please call me gale . 
but you wo n't . you 're a good man detective . we think alike . i know you need my help . and i know you know i need your help . 
shit . sarah darling .   i interviewed her too . god it 's happening again is n't it detective ? 
oh . i thought you wanted me to stick around . 
alright kincaid no where to ? 
i 'd love to help really i would n't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath but i honestly do n't know where sidney is . after windsor she dropped off the face of the earth . the only other person that might know is   not going to talk . 
that 's sidney prescott 's mother . 
a note ? 
so is that why you 're here ? is that why you 're holding me from my show to tell me about some brutal homicide i 'm not even involved in ? 
well i interviewed damon once for the show . he was a real obnoxious fuck . any way the second one christine perkins she had a part in stab 2 did n't she ? she was playing cici . 
jesus christ you scared the shit out of me . 
sure why not . you did save my lifemr . rielly . 
paternity test results . christ dewey you 're never going to believe who milton 's kid is . 
sidney what happened ? 
i work better alone .   why do n't you do some snooping around the set ? 
i 've got an idea i 'll hook up with you guys later . 
has anyone else every used your phone ? 
do you have her number stored in your memory ?   phone memory ! 
thank you . 
amen boy scout now answer the fucking door ! 
neither are you magnum p.i. 
i happen to work for the police god dammit ! 
jennifer ? ! wait where are you going off to ? 
and who is that ? 
right . sorry .   do you think he did it ? 
i 'm sorry this is too good ! 
someone stole sid 's file ? 
all of what dewey ?   you do know something do n't you ? 
dewey you 're not just here because of that second rate k - mart straight - to - video version of me are you ? 
it did n't work dewey .   we tried   we 're different . 
it was fucking ' 60 minutes ii ' !   i could n't say no !   i could 've been the next diane sawyer ! 
you said you 'd never leave woodsboro ' the only place that 's real ! '   but now you 're here . not with me .   dewey i took care of you .   i waited until you were well .   i could n't stay there i mean it 's like dog years one year in woodsboro is like seven everywhere else . 
again i am the author of the definitive book on the woodsboro murders . !   what about you ? 
yes . look let 's get something straight dewey i got into this shit cause the police came looking for me . not cause i 'm out to make the sunrise studios slashings . 
this has everything to do with me dewey . i was the one who brought the nation 's attention to this shit anyway . i 'll be damned if i 'm gon na sit around and pass on the buck again . 
uh - huh . another news clipping . another one about sid 's mom . dewey whether we like it   or not it looks like we 're going to have to   go back into our past . 
show him . 
dewey personal lives and pasts aside this is about sidney . we need to know where she is . 
would you excuse me for a moment ? 
your life ? 
roman from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way .   honestly though   tell us what 's your favorite scary movie ? 
it 's a pleasure to finally meet you roman . 
do you get any of my witty humor ? i mean you did play me for three movies .   his two hands dingus . 
milton 's not a killer . he 's a pervert . he probably went out to buy more ky jelly for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends . 
settle down beavis .   why do n't you tell us the truth ? 
nobody said she was an actor . 
oh i wish i got that one on tape . it 'd put a smile on my face everytime i 'm down . 
really you know you 'd make a fascinating interview . lifestyles of the rich and psychotic . 
no really ? 
ha . maybe i should join snl . 
and as a sane person .   for you that must be quite a stretch . 
i am gale weathers ! 
what the hell are you doing ? 
no ! he 's not dead ! he 's still breathing ! look ! 
i dunno but i can tell you that your 's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass ! now come out and fight like a real man you pussy ! 
listen you sick bastard what the fuck do you want ? 
who 's phone ? 
i do n't know . screw them . look what 's important is that we stick together . no matter what . if anyone is next it 's you or me jen . 
still that was a much better movie i saw it at the premiere last week . god what the hell am i getting sidetracked with this shit for ? ! we 've got ta get down to business . 
and i die naked ? !   ugh ! this is complete bullshit . who wrote this piece of crap ? 
wait a second whoa ! calm down ! number one there were five different versions of the script given out . ben damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role . it only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script . and what i die in stab 3 ? 
dewey what the hell is she rambling about now ? what 's wrong jen see yourself on one of those usa network winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting ? 
are you saying she was- 
well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over national tv ? why do n't you start talking . 
i do n't think so !   just what happened to maureen when she was in hollywood ? 
just because you knew her ? 
and now ? i mean murders on your set and still you say nothing ? 
answer the question . you knew sidney 's mom ? 
they 're the ones who approved it . 
oh come on ! why the hostility ? 
excuse me detective i think we have some business to attend to . 
i think we should go inside . i have to have a talk with the cast . all of you . 
heh well that 's tv journalism for ya . stage the news to boost ratings . 
tom prinze tanked as usual . that 's a shocker . 
let 's get out of here ! 
i know ! he killed kincaid ! 
we did some researching in the archives . sid something dawned on me when i wrote the book on your mother 's murder . for two years of her life 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the earth . 
who 's this . 
what 'd he say ? 
oh my god ! sidney you ran fast or what ?   hey . 
oh yeah how ? 
how is that good news ? 
i used to think i had the perfect mom perfect family .   till i found out i was wrong .   she had a secret life and i tried to understand that and soon as i thought i had more secrets .   i do n't ' know who my mom was .   sometimes i feel like i 'm just learning about my mother for the first time . you know with tv and those movies and what not . god sometimes i feel like i 'm just learning about myself for the first time . like i 'm watching my life instead of living in it . 
ghosts are tough   you ca n't shoot ghosts . 
what do you mean ? 
excuse me ? 
must be exciting beautiful place beautiful people . 
did you request this case ? 
i 'll call you mark when you catch the killer detective . 
you seem to like movies detective . 
what do you know about trilogies ? 
why did n't you tell me ?   this is my mother dewey . why did n't you say something ? 
he was n't superhuman dewey . he was n't superhuman at all . 
dewey ! it 's gale ! 
dewey my god i thought you were dead . 
they 've got her ! 
where are you dewey ? 
dewey ? ! ohmigod ! where are you ? ! 
jesus christ dewey help me ! they tried to kill me in the bathroom ! the killers ! 
no i 'll be ok . i 've got my mace . my knife .   these two lethal weapons . 
listen dewey i have to go to the bathroom . 
i can see nothing 's changed . 
she was randy 's only girlfriend . . . ever . 
mm what a waste of silicone .   what does my mother have to do with this all dewey ? we 're a long way from woodsboro . 
listen detective i wanna see this studio where all this shit 's going down . 
i figured i 'd be safe if i was at least up here with the people i care about .   now where 's this kincaid guy the news is talking about ? i found this place from a fox 5 tv news report . heh . 
well it 's not safe for me up there either . the killer found me dewey . he called me last night . 
gale watchout ! 
i know ! 
gale he 's got dewey ! 
what are you talking about ? 
oh my god karen you scared the shit out of me ! what are you doing here ? 
hi gale . i 'm glad you 're all right . 
roman knock it off ! do you people even know why you kill people ? you kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason ! 
i ca n't take it anymore . this hollywood exploitation of the nightmare i lived has to be stopped . i did this to make you all repent for your sins and now i 'm pleased i 've got my message across . good - bye . 
listen i have no time for this . i 've heard this shit before ! so lets get on with it ! 
oh my god angie crick ? from english class ? 
all the nightmares . all the hell i went through was because of you you spineless bastard ! 
alright i 'm here now show your   face so we can finish this . 
i thought you wanted me here ? 
alright i 'm here . now what ? 
you 're dead ! 
how do i know their voices are -- 
who is this ? 
if you lay a hand on him i 'll fucking kill you ! 
the final act ? well let 's play asshole ! 
no . you did n't kill my mother . billy loomis and stu macher did . 
you sick fuck i 'm tracing this call as we speak ! the police are gon na nail your ass ! 
w - what do you want ? 
who the fuck is this ? 
i 'm sorry your voice . 
well then the people you need to call are the police . 
are you sure ? 
yes hi i 'm laura i 'm a trained counselor . how can i help you . 
rob reiner and quentin tarentino ? 
i think milton 's the killer . i think he just went out to kill another cast member . 
oh come on !   you have made millions off the story of her murder .   you 're obsessed with her and you 're obsessed with her daughter ! 
good twist . 
look who 's talking moneybags . you got more homes than i do . 
basements creep me out . 
gale weathers would find a way . 
there a story in that building ? 
need to get in that building ? 
that 's funny . 
you know in the movies i play you as being much smarter . 
here 's how i see it .   i 've got no house no movie no gun and i 'm being stalked .   because someone wants to kill me ?   no because someone wants to kill you . so now starting now i go where you go .   that way if someone wants to kill me i 'll be with you and since they really want to kill you they wo n't kill me they 'll kill you .   make sense ? 
being gale weathers .   what the hell are you doing ? 
god damn it you two ! run ! hurry ! he 's dead ! 
what 's your favorite scary movie gale ? 
oh shit it 's my cell ! 
shit ! where the hell are tom and angelina ? 
i know right . it was kinda weak . that 's cause will kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it . the script was written by some new guy . he wrote arlington street . 
god damn you gale weathers ! do n't you see ? the killer is choosing   his victims as they die in the script ! ben damon 's character was the first one to get offed . so was his girlfriend - but she was n't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then sarah darling 's candy and now me ! 
you ! how can i ever get any fame playing you ! 
got ta find me first you pansy - assed mama 's boy . 
not so fast . we 're gon na play a little game . it 's called guess who just called the police and reported your sorry motherfucking ass ? 
are you alone in the house ? 
stop it ! 
i do n't understand ... 
why did you kill my mother ? 
fuck you . 
no ! do n't believe him . 
i thought you were ... 
no but if it were you that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track . using your one phone call to call me so i would n't think it was you . 
uh - huh . 
no sheriff burke called your dad . i saw him . 
when you 're arrested -- you 're allowed one phone call ? who did you call ? 
who did you call ? 
yeah ... i think so . 
you heard me . 
or even a good porno . 
i wanna let go . i do ... 
but this is life . this is n't a movie . 
everytime i get close to you i see my mom . i know it does n't make sense . 
i think in some weird analytical psychological bullshit way i 'm scared i 'm gon na turn out just like her you know ? like the bad seed or something ... 
but you 're right -- enough is enough . i ca n't wallow in the grief process forever and i ca n't keep lying to myself about who my mom was . 
no billy . i 'm the one who 's been selfish and self - absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress . 
it 's okay . we need to talk . 
your parents split up . it 's not the same thing . your mom left town she 's not in a coffin somewhere . 
tomorrow . one year tomorrow . 
no it 's me billy . i need time . i 'm still adjusting to my mom . 
you know that 's not true . 
i 'm so sorry ... please understand . 
i know . he called again last night at tatum 's house . 
no ... i do n't ... it 's just ... oh god billy someone was there someone tried to kill me . 
jesus shit ! 
he 's here . he 's trying to kill me ... 
oh billy ... please ... god ... 
would you settle for a pg-13 relationship ? 
you know what my dad will do to you ? 
so you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump - bump . 
oh it did ? 
now that it 's out of your system . 
what are you doing here ? 
my dad 's in the other room . 
what are you doing here ? 
billy ? what the ... 
should i be worried ? 
have they found my father ? 
thanks dewey . but with my luck they 'd cast tori spelling . 
god look at this place it 's the town that dreaded sundown . 
and my dad ? any word on him ? 
somebody called me dewey . i 'm not making it up . 
any word on my dad ? 
i do n't know . i guess . 
at the airport . 
did you reach my dad ? 
... yeah ... 
i saw him leaving wearing it . 
he 's lying . she would n't have touched him . he raped her then butchered her . her blood was all over his coat . 
has his story changed ? 
have you talked to cotton ? 
during the trial you did all those stories about me . you called me a liar . 
do you still think he 's innocent ? 
and it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories . 
you owe my mother . 
please . you owe me . 
off the record . no cameras . 
i want to talk to you . 
i 'm not here to fight . 
i 'll look for it . 
how 's the book ? 
it 's okay tatum . she 's just doing her job . right gale ? 
who are you ? 
good try randy . tell tatum to hurry . bye now . 
what am i doing ? 
can you see me right now ? 
so where are you ? 
why would you call me from my front porch ? 
so where are you ? 
so who are you ? 
that is so unoriginal . you disappoint me randy . 
because they 're all the same . it 's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who ca n't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door . they 're ridiculous . 
do n't start . you know i do n't watch that shit . 
i like that thing you 're doing with your voice randy . it 's sexy . 
aha randy you gave yourself away . are you calling from work ? tatum 's on her way over . 
i have no idea . 
have a good trip . 
got it . 
... out at the airport ... 
no you did n't . 
can you knock ? 
only if it 's a nice meg ryan movie . 
do n't come any closer . 
stop . right there . 
the fog terror train prom night -- how come jamie lee curtis is in all these movies ? 
so stu what 's your motive ? billy 's got one . the police are on their way . what are you going to tell them ? 
you 'll never get away with this . 
you 're crazy -- both of you . 
why are you doing this ?

why do you want to know my name ? 
why ? you wanna ask me out ? 
the first one was but the rest sucked . 
yeah ... freddy krueger . 
uh ... nightmare on elm street . 
uh ... halloween . you know the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters . what 's yours ? 
i do n't know . 
uh - huh . 
just some scary movie . 
i 'm getting ready to watch a video . 
uh - huh . 
i do n't think so . 
who is this ? 
they 've got 900 numbers for that . seeya . 
you 're forgiven . bye now . 
so why did you dial it again ? 
it happens . take it easy . 
i think you have the wrong number . 
what number are you trying to reach ? 
who are you trying to reach ? 
i 'll get my camera . 
sidney 's father ? 
people treat me like the antichrist of television journalism . 
what about gale weathers ? i sound like a meteorologist ... 
i like it . it 's ... sexy . 
so is dewey your real name ? 
can i bring kenny ? 
i 'd love to . if you 're sure it 's alright ? 
what kind of lead ? 
mind if i join you ? 
then what are you doing here ? 
you never know when or where a story will break . 
deputy ... good evening . 
you are precious . please call me gale . 
am i keeping you ? i 'm sorry . 
he 's not a suspect is he ? 
really ? you small town guys are good . and have you located sidney 's father ? 
well we can hope ca n't we ? we certainly do n't have any leads . a ghost mask a cellular phone -- not much there . 
boy you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer . 
twenty - five huh ? in a demographic study i proved to be most popular amongst males 11 - 24 . i just missed you . of course you do n't look a day over twelve except in the upper torso area . does the force require that you work out ? 
i know i should be in new york covering the sharon stone stalker but who knew ? please call me gale . you look awfully young to be a police officer . 
and why is that ? has something happened ? 
productive . so they 're closing down the school ? 
hi ! gale weathers . field correspondent inside story . 
as long as it records i do n't give a shit . we 're not doing a remote . 
what 's the delay ? 
prep the compact we 'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight 's festivities . 
not this time . i owe cotton that much . hell even i thought that man was guilty . 
if i 'm gon na blow this up -- i need hard proof . 
no not so fast . we have nothing concrete . 
jesus christ ! an innocent man on death row . a killer still on the loose . kenny tell me i 'm dreaming . 
jesus ! the camera - hurry ! 
but could n't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat ? the same person who planted it in cotton 's car framing him ? the same person who really killed your mother ? 
he was drunk that night . he left his coat at your house after your mother seduced him ... 
not one word . he admits to having sex with your mother but that 's all . 
many times . 
i think you falsely identified him . yes . 
he was convicted in a court of law . your testimony put him away . it does n't matter what i think . 
what is your problem ? you got what you wanted . cotton weary is in jail . they 're gon na gas him . a book is not gon na change that . 
your mother 's murder was last year 's hottest court case . somebody was gon na write a book about it . 
i owe you shit . 
forget it . 
kenny . camera . now . 
just stay back . 
i 'll send you a copy . 
it 'll be out later this year . 
yes that 's right . 
what is she doing here ? 
no dewey . you 'll ruin the whole night . 
do n't be so self - righteous . it 's just a little blow out -- we 'll be perfectly safe . 
i 'm sorry deputy dewey - boy but we 're ready to go . 
hey ... dewey . can we go now ? 
yes you doofus . 
oh god sid i 'm sorry i was late . 
i thought blockbuster fired you . 
fuck you nut case . where were you last night ? 
stu was with me last night . 
there 's that sense of humor . i knew it still existed . ohh sid let 's have some fun tonight . 
oh sidney . what ? a guy can talk tits til he 's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie . watch out . 
watch the show sid . his basket is bigger than the one you 're pushing . 
with stu there 's little time to stop and reflect . but sometimes before to relax and get in the mood i think about grant goodeve . 
billy and his penis do n't deserve you . 
you have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother 's untimely death . it 's no big deal . you 'll thaw out . 
he better not be . i told stu to keep his mouth shut . i think we can live without everybody 's all american for one night . 
hey sid . just think if they make a movie about you . who 's gon na play you ? 
come on let 's rock . 
do n't go there sid . you 're starting to sound like some wes carpenter flick . do n't freak yourself out -- we 've got a long night ahead of us . 
well ... you can only hear that richard gere - gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it . 
it goes further back sid . there 's been talk about other men . 
you ca n't prove a rumor . that 's why it 's a rumor . 
i did n't say that sid . but you know there were rumors . your dad was always out of town on business . maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman . 
maybe cotton weary is telling the truth . maybe he was having an affair with your mom . 
come on . pathos has it 's perks . 
this could be good . what do you think sid ? 
it was just some sick fuck having a laugh . 
just ignore him . you had good reason to think what you did . 
shit what is he doing here ? 
i want you to meet me here right after class okay ? 
just relax . you 're at school now . no one can get you here . 
come on sid . 
take a message . 
i knew this guy was too perfect . he was destined to have a flaw . 
do you really think billy did it ? 
just like old times ai n't it ? 
her dad 's out of town . she 's staying with us . 
good 'cause i wanna swing by blockbuster and get us a video . i was thinkin ' tom cruise in all the right moves . you know if you pause it just right you can see his penis . 
do n't worry . casey and steve did n't bite it til way after ten . 
practice ran late . i 'm on my way . 
i 'll be there by seven . i promise 
yeah yeah ... are you okay ? 
no prob . i 'll pick you up after practice . 
or a man 's mentality . 
they do n't know . dewey said this is the worst crime they 've ever seen . even worse than ...   well it 's bad . they 're bringing in the feds . this is big . 
fucking clueless -- they 're interrogating the entire school . teachers students staff janitors ... 
not anymore . her parents found her hanging from a tree . her insides on the outside . 
and not just killed sid . we 're talking splatter movie killed - split open end to end . 
oh god ! you do n't know ? casey becker and steve forrest were killed last night . 
do you believe this shit ? 
what am i ? the beer wench ? 
tits -- see . 
that 's mature . 
for once stu drop it . 
you know if i were accused of carving up two people i 'd take the opportunity to skip school . 
i thought you dumped her for me . 
that is so sexist . the killer could easily be female -- basic instinct . 
hunt ? why would they ask if you like to hunt ? 
this house the whole damned area around here is one mass grave ... now you might call me crazy but there is something negative about the place . 
let me guess :   another short circuit ? 
an animal ?   what kind of animal ? a goddamned t - rex or what ? 
old ? !   come look at this !   she has wounds .   wounds on her head .   like thrashes .   or bites . 
look at this !   the dog !   she 's dead ! 
i have n't the slightest idea . 
the house - tommi - something just does n't jive here ... 
it 's just a feeling .   do n't you sense it too ? 
in the village .   look what i found . 
but that 's not the point ! what if all these things are somehow connected ? 
i went to see prof. roth !   you know i had another one of those dreams last night .   i saw tommi ! 
why not ?   she can guard the house . by the way i gave her a name : clara . 
hey you 're still here .   i suppose you like it here with us . 
yeah ... i have to go to town . 
now what did i do to deserve this ? 
well apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you . do n't you remember what we promised to each other ?   honesty - trust ! 
martin it 's not funny ! 
someone from the village . 
if we stand a chance at all it 's only by sticking together . 
do you really think anything can ever be like it was before ? 
i miss tommi so much . 
i was so excited about meeting you . again and again i kept getting in the back of the line so i could be the last to talk to you . 
cherry - red tears your first book . i read it at least nine times .   and then i found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair . 
cherry - red tears . 
i have a funny feeling .   do you think we 'll get over all that 's happened ? 
maybe i should talk to dr. roth about it . 
i just had a really strange experience . 
what are you doing ? 
well if you wo n't let me smoke grass then at least i 'll go get myself some cigarettes . 
yes daddy . 
my father was a pilot .   and do i know how to fly ? 
do you have a better idea ? 
we 'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning . 
do you know where fuse box is ? 
hey ... the fuse . 
maybe the antenna 's broken . 
i mean the armchair ! 
what kind of a horrible thing is that ? 
well then i guess i 'd better leave the two of you alone .   but do n't forget ... 
me and the muse of course .   how is your book coming along ? 
so how does it feel to be kissed by two women ? 
stop that ! 
oh god tommi ... 
you 're not a doctor you 'll hurt him ! 
say it anyway .   come on how much do you love me ? 
come on say it .   you know ... 
but what is the truth ? 
thank you .   elisabeth i did n't mean to ... 
i really hate to bother him but ... 
thank you . 
i appreciate your concern but we live in that house .   i need to know what happened in there . 
1976 .   what happened back then ? 
wait wo n't you join me for a cup of coffee ? 
do i look like it that much ? 
ellen straub . 
no i 've never seen him before . 
hello .   can i help you ? 
it all went so fast .   he was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver .   i only wanted to defend myself .   you have to call the police ... 
i think i 've killed him .   martin my husband i 've killed him !   that is i 'm not sure but ... 
i 've killed my husband ! 
and that is ? 
listen it 's one thing to have a guilt complex . but i know the difference between when i 'm overstrung and when i 'm seeing things that are simply not there ! besides it only began after we moved ! 
every word . 
thomas kent ! 
what happened to sam ? 
no juliet ? ! 
i am so sorry mr. henslowe . i wanted to be an actor .   i am sorry will . 
nobody knew ! 
you will not tell . as you love me and as i love you you will bind my breast and buy me a boy 's wig ! 
oh nurse ! he would give thomas kent the life of viola de lesseps 's dreaming . 
from tomorrow away in the country for three weeks ! is master shakespeare not handsome ? 
a comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of romeo to be the very same capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the pirate king ! 
he sees himself in me ! romeo montague a young man of verona . 
but i would be valentine and silvia too . good nurse god save you and good night . i would stay asleep my whole life if i could dream myself into a company of players . 
no . . . not the artful postures of love but love that over- throws life . unbiddable ungovernable like a riot in the heart and nothing to be done come ruin or rapture . love like there has never been in a play .   i will have love or i will end my days as a . . . 
all the men at court are without poetry . if they look at me they see my father 's fortune . i will have poetry in my life . and adventure . and love . love above all . 
i am not so well - born . 
but at the playhouse . nurse ? 
but silvia i did not care for much . his fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons . stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats ! oh when can we see another ? 
did you like proteus or valentine best ? proteus for speaking valentine for looks . 
oh but they can ! 
and i love poetry above all . 
i love theatre . to have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed 
your majesty . 
your majesty . 
write me well . 
nor you for me . 
i do n't know . it 's a mystery 
but all ends well . 
but fearful of her virtue she comes to him dressed as a boy 
at sea then -- a voyage to a new world ?  she lands upon a vast and empty shore . she is brought to the duke  orsino . 
an excellent beginning   let him be  a duke . and your heroine ? 
the queen commands a comedy will for twelfth night . 
if my hurt is to be that you will write no more then i shall be the sorrier . 
it was we ourselves did that . and for my life to come i would not have it otherwise . 
a hired player no longer . fifty pounds will for the poet of true love . 
will you read it for me ? 
but i will go to wessex as a widow from these vows as solemn as they are unsanctified . 
if not wessex the queen will know the cause and there will be no more will shakespeare . 
you were not dead before . when i thought you dead i did not care about all the plays that will never come only that i would never see your face . i saw our end and it will come . 
i love you will beyond poetry . 
calf love . i loved the writer and gave up the prize for a sonnet . 
you lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed . 
you lie . 
you never spoke so well of him . 
will ! what-- ? 
stage fighting !   oh will ! as thomas kent my heart belongs to you but as viola the river divides us and i will marry wessex a week from saturday . 
you can not wessex will kill you 
you follow your desire freely enough in the night . so if that is all to greenwich i go . 
what will you have me do ? marry you instead ? 
yes this is not life will . this is a stolen season . 
oh but it will end well for love ? 
that 's my line ! 
oh will ! 
oh do not go 
it is broad day !   the rooster tells us so ! 
oh -- no no ! 
mr. henslowe ? 
it was the owl -- come to bed 
you would not leave me ? 
and that was only my first try . 
even your play . 
i would not have thought it . there is something better than a play . 
i do not know how to undress a man . 
then kiss me again for i am not mistook . 
answer me only this : are you the author of the plays of william shakespeare ? 
can you love a player ? 
oh not for the world ! 
if they find you here they will kill you . 
alas indeed for i thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart . 
anon good nurse . anon .   master shakespeare ? ! 
who is there ? 
he is dead ? 
mourning ? who is dead my lord ? 
it is to be expected on a sunday . 
i am going to church . 
it is not my riding day my lord . 
i mean  your majesty they do not they have not but i believe there is one who can 
good morning my lord ! 
i will do my duty my lord . 
the queen has consented ? 
but why me ? 
virginia ? ! 
i do not love you my lord . 
do you intend to marry my lord ? 
you flatter my lord . 
lord wessex . you have been waiting . 
so my lord ? i speak with him every day . 
my lord . 
stop him alex . you 've got to stop him . 
do n't you ever stop ? 
you must n't take it so badly . 
it 's about me and david . 
it makes us feel a whole lot better . 
oh shut up alex . 
we were just sorting things out . 
yes of course . why would n't i be ? 
as smart as you are you 'll need a little help . 
i 'll wait there . 
you 're frightened . 
it 's the only way . 
are n't you going to answer it ? 
forget it -- he 'll come down . 
where he ca n't get it ? 
and the money ? 
forget it . 
oh good . 
your painful groin ? 
what are you doing here ? 
no but he 's looking after the money so what 's the problem ? 
he 'll come down . leave him alone . 
leave him alone . 
i do n't see the point in that . 
do n't you ? 
be like a weight off your shoulders . 
he 's right . you 'd feel much better about it . 
i do n't want it to taste different . i do n't know why i bother . is that enough for you ? hey ! 
i hope it tastes better than the other stuff . 
is this the same stuff you made last week ? 
yeah you 're making us all nervous . 
then let 's spend some money . 
are you all right ? 
do n't know . no one said anything . alex rendered speechless with desire . i recall that feeling from the days when i had such a thing . 
hello . hello . 
well you certainly had a good look around . 
that 's not him . 
no i do n't . 
david i promise we will . keep him happy . 
for ever and ever . 
stop nagging . 
be careful . 
i do n't want to . it 's different . 
i do n't thinki can . 
who 's going to do it ? 
no alex . it 's it 's -- 
that s not a story alex . it 's a corpse . 
no . the guy 's dead . what more do you need ? 
do n't . 
what are you doing ? 
did what ? 
open it . 
alex the key is in the keyhole on the other side . 
a blue one ok . and it 's still there . 
alex how shouldi know ? i 'm just a girl . 
so what 's wrong with that ? 
his car 's still there . 
so i gathered . 
have you seen hugo ? 
no alex we do n't really love you . 
you 're right . 
the man we know and love . 
-- which is -- 
-- instead of what he is -- 
in a moment he 's going to tell he could have been someone -- 
not usually this drunk . 
so we 'll meet him then ? 
who was it ? 
he seemed like a nice guy alex . 
-- more than anyone she has ever met . in her whole life . 
she hated you -- 
for the flat . 
maybe you should go alex . you'll meet someone wonderful . 
i thought you stopped going . 
just serve . 
ok so a has left you b is ambivalent you 're still seeing c but d is the one you yearn for . what are we to make of this ? if i were you i 'd ditch the lot . there 's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love . 
now let me get this straight . this affair that you 're not having is it not with a man or not with a woman ? 
i mean what are you actually doing here ? what is the hidden agenda ? 
it was n't like that . 
eh i do n't know . 
so let 's go . 
it was on the television . 
i should hope so . 
with a face like this ? 
no one . 
no one . i promise . 
that 's what it cost david . 
two hundred pounds . 
two hundred . 
it 's alright . i think he got the message anyway . 
do you think you could be a little more forceful next time ? 
yes . they 're my friends . 
would you like to talk about it ? 
are you all right ? 
alex i think it 's time for you to stop . 
just get on with it alex . 
it 's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is quite simply just that . 
look it 's a fairly straightforward question . you 're either divorced or you 're not . 
why do you want a room here ? 
oh him . well he died . 
here ? . 
what guy that died ? 
what guy ? 
and that 's not the same thing ? 
you know about it ? 
a certain weakness . 
no . but he needs treatment . 
i 'm a doctor . 
no just leave it . he knows i must be at home . i 'm working nights this week . 
it 's an improvement . 
did he sound upset ? 
yes the telephone but if it 's for me i 'm not in . hugo you 're not in . 
do you think you could answer that ? 
writing seems easy . 
i see . 
what 's it about ? 
what do you do ? 
would you like to see the rest ? 
would you like to come in ? 
you must be hugo . 
the first one was fine . 
yes the first one 's fine . heathrow direct . 
that sounds fine . 
i suppose so . 
same as everyone else . 
no . i have n't seen them . 
i 'm sorry i 've never seen any of them . 
-- think what you have time to think lester . 
lester you 're a miserable man . you 're not helping anybody . you 're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business do n't kid yourself . and you know the worst thing about it even if it does somebody some good somewhere which i ca n't possibly imagine you 'll never know the difference . you 're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you 're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she 'll keep her hands off him . 
-- is that what this is all about ? 
-- is that right ? 
you make me sick . just be straight for once in your life . 
we can not go into this later . 
-- cause she 's going to be very very expensive . 
-- i hope you like miss shawn -- 
i just thought you 'd like to know -- 
that girl 's making an awful spectacle of herself . 
lester do n't you think that uhh -- 
that 's george . 
that you were just indulging me . 
yes but ... i thought ... 
i do n't know . he 's a hairdresser . 
maybe ... why do you ask ? 
well i do n't know for sure ... he 's a hairdresser . 
do n't be silly . i 'll just tell lester we were smoking a couple of joints . see ? 
sweetheart it 's a bore out there ... let 's lock the door . 
and who 's jill ? 
she what ? 
why did n't you come alone ? lester invited you . did you have to bring her ? 
right now i just do n't care . 
no baby ... i 'm glad you 're coming tonight . 
comb my hair out later honey . 
hello george . 
i mean it or i would n't say it . 
and i certainly would n't tell lester . 
i would n't say so if i did n't . 
i hope she 's all right . 
is she all right ? 
the shop . i think you 're a good investment and i do n't mind telling him . 
why do n't you see lester ? 
what about ? 
we have this political thing tonight . could you comb me out at the house ? 
what 're you doing later ? 
i can see that . 
i 've never been treated that way and i 'm not going to start now . 
i 'm not used to that kind of treatment . 
-- to be put in that kind of position ... 
-- i like myself far too much far too much . 
-- numbers and i do n't need to place myself in that kind of position . 
i 'm perfectly calm george i 'm simply saying you have no respect for me that you 're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average hollywood ... mummers ... 
i do n't care about that girl i do n't care if she 's dead . 
i do n't care . 
i do n't want to talk about it ... 
you 're late george . 
i do n't want to see you anymore . 
you 're very rude ... if you do n't come back -- 
so what are you doing going over there ? you 're not her doctor . 
it turned out to be cancer . 
ruth lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer . 
gee that 's very serious ... 
that 's very serious . who 's her doctor ? 
does she have a pancreatic ulcer ? 
why not ? 
thanks a lot . 
you mean that girl do n't you ? 
i thought you said you were n't going anywhere . 
what 're you looking for ? 
whoever she is she does n't give up does she ? 
god i adore you . 
do n't worry honey i 'll protect you . 
how do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked ? particularly in your business ... you deal with women every day ... 
no . you know too many sick ladies . 
then it 's not your problem . 
are you ?

beverly hills hairdresser ... what kind of a thing is that to do ... you might as well be a faggot ... think that 's funny too ? 
you live a phony cheap cop - out existence . 
you think that 's funny do n't you ?

i never get my hair done . 
you do n't have to make conversation with me i 'm not my mother ... do you have a thing about older women ... that 's sort of faggoty is n't it ? 
do n't make conversation with me .

i 've got to ... i 've got to tell him where i am . 
i ca n't just let him stand by the door ... 
god there 's lester ... 
what 's that supposed to mean ? 
lester 's left felicia . he 's taking me to acapulco on the five o'clock flight . he 's asked me to marry him . 
it 's too late ... 
if you knew how many times i wanted to hear you say that ... 
well then what are you trying to do- 
you 're going to kill me . 
that 's it then i 'm leaving . 
look -- either you leave or i leave because i do n't want the two of us here when lester arrives . i just do n't -- 
forget about last night it 's okay we 'll talk when i get back --

lester 's on his way . 
-- yes honey you 've got to get out of here .

-- well you better go after her . 
-- we are ? 
what 's wrong ? 
well of course . who loves a big fanny on a man ?

he still having parties ?

-- just get me out of here baby . i ca n't stand it . it 's killing me . 
he just completely ignores me . he could have at least said something introduced me or something . 
that son of a bitch everything he says is a phony piece of shit what does he think i 'm some cigar butt he 's got between his teeth -- 
we 're upstairs george . now come on . behave yourself and for christ 's sake do me a favor . do n't let me drink too much .

george ... how about felicia ? 
if you screw me up for tonight i 'll kill you i swear to god i 'll kill you . 
there was nothing to know . anyway ... if i ca n't have love i have to at least have money . i have to have some pride i can do something . 
anyway he offered me a silver cloud . at least he should give me a ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something ... 
no ... lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it . 
it was after you baby . after you . 
and what ? 
... he tried to ... uh ... make it with me . 
bernstein ... seemed to think i hated men . 
the shrink ? many times . 
not too much do n't cut too much . 
it 's the sauna i keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot . 
what 's wrong ? 
... i do n't get it done often .

jill 's coming with us .

he 's a very private person actually . 
oh about six weeks now ... lester -- well he 's very sweet . 
jill 's really great is n't she ? 
-- maybe she 'll come with us . if i tell her how important it is to me i do n't think she 'll mind . do you ? 
so how 's norman ? 
-- well more than anything else --   -- i 'd like to suck his cock . 
you do ? 
sid . you must be a very important executive . 
that 's very sweet of you mr. roth . 
-- you phony asshole -- 
jackie shawn . 
you know what 's wrong . 
i do n't know . why do n't you ask him ? 
jesus she 's my best friend . 
jill haynes jill haynes i 've told you about jill a hundred times lester you never remember anything i say . 
lester this is my friend jill and this is johnny pope . 
because i do n't want one . 
they 're yorkies and they do n't shed . 
just a second i 've got ta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house . 
shut the door shut the door ! 
you 're still jealous . 
you 're lying about one thing lester . 
you and your touchy investors . 
really ? how about starting with tonight ? 
that 's not very logical lester . 
so i ca n't talk to some broken down actor what do you think i 'm going to tell him i 'm screwing lester karpf ! 
i 'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody i ca n't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you . you 're driving me up the wall lester . you 're even jealous of the dogs . i mean i 've got ta have somebody i can talk to . 
i ran into him at the 76 station on little santa monica what was i supposed to do hide in the ladies room ? yes i was talking to him . 
steve slutes and he 's not a boy .   steve could n't get arrested as an actor . he could n't get arrested as a boy . 
who do you think i was talking to ? 
i am ? 
no kidding ? your own shop ? 
i go to the blue'n gold barber shop in westwood . the guy in the third chair 's dynamite ... nobody much . 
well yes george is a wonderful hairdresser . 
oh hi i mean hello we 've met . 
the man from sloan 's is coming . i called you about it . 
anyway you 're crazy . 
that 's right . 
poster - kleiser . 
going for a pony ride at kiddielands want to come along ? 
hi leonard . 
no he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- god it was hot . the wood on the sundeck everything . 
well ... i just kept wiping that dish . maybe it does n't sound very sexy but it was . 
-- he reached up and tore them . 
-- he came up behind me and i was wiping a dish and he just ... lifted up my skirt and you know right there ... 
-- well it was very hot so i 'd left the door open and the water was running so i did n't hear him come down the stairs ... 
-- i was in the kitchen doing the dishes and george was out in long beach doing a show ... 
well there was this one time -- 
-- i guess i just blocked it out that 's all . 
-- when you say forty - five minutes or an hour do you mean continuous time ? just continually without stopping ? 
i would say so yes . 
it 's been so long i do n't how long ? 
he does ? 
how much ? 
after four years ? no i do n't ... and i do n't know too many girls who do . 
really jill are n't you exaggerating just a little ? five times a day ? 
five times a day ? 
-- yeah honey ... 
we do n't think marriage is important . 
i thought you said things were great with george . 
it must be something . 
well what is it honey ? 
you 're really a love -- you sure ? 
jill you 're a real sweetie pie . you really are .   you 're sure you do n't mind ? 
face it you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you 've got to find somebody . face it time is n't on your side . 
i spent three years with him . i just could n't take it not knowing who was gon na pay the rent ... his unemployment or mine . george was adorable but it drove me crackers . now at least i 'm comfortable . lester does what he says he 'll do . maybe you 're happy living like a gypsy . are you ? 
jill i 'm just trying to be helpful . 
well he is . 
no listen . he 's a very good hairdresser . 
oh honey do n't be totally naive . 
a real swinger . he 's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years . 
i think you 're crazy . do n't look over it 's lenny silverman . 
i said you were a loser ! 
george if you keep this up i 'm going to scream . 
yes yes i did . 
stop it . 
george now cut this out . 
please ! ... that 's not like you . 
-- yes . 
i wish you 'd go now . 
... honest . at least you 're honest with me . 
... well i 'm glad you told me . 
i 'll know you 've lied to me ... all along . i 'll know you 're incapable of ... love ... that 'll help me ... not now but eventually . 
-- no it 'll help me really -- 
-- it 'll help me if you 'll tell me . 
i do n't want to be a fool ! ... i want to look them in the eye and say i know ! 
i just want to know while we were seeing each other ... i just do n't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing ... 
i just want to know that 's all . 
how many ? 
obviously there were others were n't there ? 
so who else was there besides jackie ? huh ? ... huh ? 
who knows i 'm sure you do n't -- but if it 'll help any i found it in your bed . 
-- and take this with you . 
i 'd like you to leave now . 
let go of me or i 'll scream i 'll call the police . 
let go of me . 
i 'm very tired george . 
what is . 
i did n't want him meeting me here . 
i do n't want to fight george . 
-- what ?   -- i 'll see you later ... 
-- go ahead . 
-- she 's a very compulsive girl . 
ha ha . 
oh honey . if we had one place we could have a nicer place and i could take care of it . we 're almost never here . 
i know honey . 
i have to have jackie ask me ? do n't you think you could call me and let me know ? look at my hair . 
i 've been trying to reach you all afternoon . you were n't in the shop . what is this thing tonight ? 
what business meeting ? 
never mind . where 've you been ? 
a friend dropped me off . 
... okay ... 
but i never know when you 're working and when you 're not working ! 
when is that george ? 
when is that ? 
look either we have a meaningful relationship or we do n't i 've got to know . 
i want your feelings about it . 
your advice ! 
no but i think they might . 
whether or not i 'm going . 
i know but this is important . i have to make a decision . 
when can i talk to you ? 
i already said hello . 
okay but how did it go at the bank ? 
i said i was n't sure if i could go . 
could i ? 
could i talk to you for a second ? 
how did it go at the bank ? 
they want me to go to egypt for three weeks . 
jackie says she would n't bring children into this world . that it 's hypocritical and overpopulated . 
not right now i do n't mean right now ... but eventually ... 
you 've never even been around one . 
maybe you do n't even like children . 
but in the same house you know one house . 
will we live together ? 
why am i great ? 
do you really mean that ? 
i am ? 
i am ? 
what about me ? 
i thought you said you were at the epitome of your life . 
honey what happened ? 
fine . how are you ? 
now george -- 
george i do n't -- 
i do n't know . i ca n't remember . it was just in my dream . 
i just ... who what ? 
they 're dumb somebody ... i do n't know ... 
i 've had these dumb dreams lately . 
i do n't know ... just ... somebody 's going to get me . 
i do n't know ... every once in a while i just get the feeling something awful 's going to happen . 
let me come too .   please do n't leave me alone . 
here in the canyon . 
gunshots there were some gunshots . 
there were some shots . 
somebody 's mother . 
i was too old . 
a daytime soap opera . 
well commercials . i read for a soap the other day . 
no it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time ? 
what did you do ? 
did n't you have any panties on ? 
... mmm - hmmm . 
-- uhh - huhh ... 
-- yesss ? 
c'm on . 
-- well -- not going in and out i do n't mean just that . why are you asking me ? you went with george longer than i have . 
-- see i just know that if i go to egypt well things happen i just do n't know what 'll happen to us he just never seems to think ahead does he ? 
i think you 're going to hit that car in front of us . 
quite a while ... an hour an hour and a half -- sometimes forty - five minutes -- that 's quite a while is n't it ? 
well yes -- you know that about george . 
well ... it 's not so much the number of times he does it it 's ... he does it for a long time . 
i 'm exaggerating . 
well you know what i mean . 
-- i guess it 's all got to do with this shop . 
i do n't know . one minute he 's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything 's going to be great and he 's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he wo n't even talk to me . it 's driving me crazy . 
but you have problems ? 
well they are . but we have problems . you say things are great with lester . is he going to marry you ? 
well it 's george . 
-- no . no really . 
do n't be silly . 
i guess not . 
george is great but i know what you mean . 
i know i 'm sorry . 
so what 's your point ? 
i 'm not . maybe i am . 
i am ? i mean why ? 
who is that ? 
-- still -- at least we should tell him we 're going . c'm on . 
we ca n't really leave that poor man here alone . 
johnny !   why did n't you tell me before ? 
you 're kidding . 
you 're going ? 
now i did n't mean that you rat . 
-- so when are you going to egypt ? 
oh johnny mr. karpf needed a ride home and i said we 'd take him . do you mind ? 
-- why ? 
let 's do that . 
-- jackie really should n't drink -- 
that bastard . 
well did he go in there with jackie ? 
george ? was he alone ? 
well ... sure ... 
getting your hair done ...   would you like to go to a party ? 
he 's a hairdresser . 
-- no . 
-- never mind . 
sort of . 
of course not ... he 's sort of a boyfriend . 
well he 's not exactly a friend . 
... my friend does n't like it here either . 
why do n't you ask for another one ? 
oh . thank you . 
now i 'm embarrassed to tell you . 
but why egypt ? 
thank you . 
-- yes jill . 
-- there 's not much room -- 
-- i 'll get in the back -- 
sure thing mr. karpf . c'm on . 
-- his car . they have it blocked . 
please do n't misunderstand ... i 'd really like to go . 
no it 's not that ... 
no ... how long did you say ? 
danny come here ! 
danny .   danny stop it .   danny ! 
are you having a bad dream ? 
danny ... what 's the matter hon ? 
if jack wo n't come with us we 'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves .   that 's all there is to it . 
make sure you come right back 'cause i 'm going to make lunch soon . okay ? 
well all right .   but really do n't make a sound . 
come on doc .   he only went to bed a few hours ago .   ca n't you wait till later ? 
not right now daddy 's asleep . 
i did n't think it was going to be this big did you ? 
it 's so pretty . 
oh what a maze .   is n't it beautiful . 
give me your hand .   oh is n't it beautiful . 
okay danny you win .   let 's take the rest of this walking huh ? 
and you 're gon na lose .   and i 'm gon na get you - you betta run fast ! look out - i 'm coming in close . all right ? 
the loser has to keep american clean how 's that ? 
okay .   you behave yourself . 
danny come on over here . 
hey was n't it around here that the donner party got snowbound ? 
we 'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel okay ? 
we 're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then i 'll come back and check on you okay ? 
what about tony ?   he 's looking forward to the hotel i bet . 
yeah i know .   it always takes a little time to make new friends . 
sure danny it will be lots of fun . 
well it 's just one of those things . you know ... purely an accident um . my husband had oh ... been drinking and he came home about three hours late so he was n't exactly in the greatest mood that night .   and well danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room ... and my husband grabbed his arm you know and pulled him away from them . it's ... it 's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just ... used too much strength and he injured danny 's arm . 
ah he dislocated his shoulder . 
no um let 's see i guess danny started talkin to tony about the time we put him into nursery school . 
only about three months .   eh we 're from vermont .   my husband was teaching school there . 
but eh what was the matter with him ? 
oh yeah .   oh yeah he seems absolutely fine now but you should have seen him . 
shall we go into the living room ? 
sound good to you danny ? 
no we do n't mind . 
yeah .   we call him doc sometimes you know like in the bugs bunny cartoons .   but how did you know that ? 
doc .   you called danny ' doc ' twice just now . 
i would n't know what to do with it if i did . 
god .   this is the kitchen huh ? 
i 'm a wendy . 
nice to meet you . 
i 'm gon na go now . 
i 'll bring back a doctor . 
go away . 
go away . 
go away from me . 
get down . 
jack stay away from me ! 
stay away from me . 
stay ... stay away ! 
stop it ! 
stay away from me . 
stay away from me !   please ... 
stay away from me ! 
stay away from me ! 
stay away ... ! 
stay away from me 
do n't hurt me !   do n't hurt me ! 
i just want to go back to my room . 
stay away from me ! 
oh jack what are you talking about ? 
of course i am . 
well i ... i think maybe he should be taken to a doctor . 
i do n't know . 
i ca n't really remember . 
somebody did that to him . 
he 's still asleep . 
and you did n't see anything at all ? 
you went into the room danny said - to 237 ? 
did you find anything ? 
no .   it 's the truth really .   i swear it .   danny told me .   he went up into one of the bedrooms the door was open and he saw this crazy woman in the bath - tub .   she tried to strangle him . 
it 's okay .   it 's okay now .   really . 
okay .   i understand .   i 'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and ... maybe you 'll let me read something then . 
ah come on hon .   do n't be so grouchy . 
yeah .   it 's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place .   i tell you when we first came up here i thought it was kinda scarey . 
it 's really nice up here is n't it ? 
well something'll come .   it 's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day . 
any ideas yet ? 
it 's really pretty outside .   how about taking me for a walk after you 've finished your breakfast ? 
i made 'em just the way you like 'em sunny side up . 
i guess we 've been staying up too late . 
it 's about eleven thirty . 
good morning hon .   your breakfast is ready . 
god i 've never seen anything like this before .   are all of these indian designs authentic ? 
boy we must be really high up . the air feels so different . 
hi hon .   how 's it going ? 
just like a ghost ship huh ? 
it 's amazing how much activity is going on today . 
boy i bet you we could really have a good party in this room huh hon ? 
oh i 'll say . 
oh well he sure did a beautiful job . pink and gold are my favorite colors . 
oh well they 're really gorgeous . as a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel i 've ever seen . 
oh it 's beautiful .   my god this place is fantastic is n't it hon ? 
well ... thank you . 
do n't push it . 
perhaps not .   perhaps we can all use ... a little spandex . 
you have evidenced great maturity mary robert .   we shall have a serious discussion . 
very well .   i hold you responsible for all of this for introducing a lounge act into my convent .   for utterly disrupting our way of life .   and for placing all of us in mortal danger .   thank - you . 
i 'm a christian . 
saving you .   move ! 
good day . 
i am sorry mary clarence .   i seem to have misplaced my tambourine .   good day mary clarence . 
you and i know that life is not so simple .   there will be disappointments . rude shocks .   and you will have vanished . how ... fortunate . 
a part of what ?   mary clarence it is one thing to rabble rouse to sweep into town and declare a holiday .   you have raised the sisters ' expectations you have excited and confused them .   they imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party . 
indeed .   after how long ?   a few weeks ? i have been here thirty years .   and yet it would seem i know nothing . 
i must go where i can be of use . 
i have submitted my resignation to bishop o'hara .   privately .   i have asked to be relocated as soon as possible . 
really .   well that makes two of us . 
you have a phone call . 
the majority has spoken . 
of course .   mary clarence a convent is not a totalitarian state .   most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole .   a membership that i am certain will vote in a rational and pious manner . all those in favor of allowing mary clarence to select a program ? 
i believe this can be settled by a simple vote . 
the council of cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire catholic church .   they command the utmost respect . your more ... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place . 
and on such an occasion i feel a completely traditional program will be best . 
and i am refusing .   as of tomorrow mary lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir . 
out of the question . 
through blasphemy ?   you have corrupted the entire choir ! 
and what next ?   popcorn ?   curtain calls ? this is not a theater .   or a casino . 
the choir mary clarence .   go for the gold . 
you 're my olympic event . 
you will sing and you will sleep ' that is your schedule until you depart .   as almost no one attends mass you will be unable to cause further damage . 
you have i believe some minimal background in music .   therefore you are to join our choir . 
you may stay .   but i shall restrict your activities to but a single task . 
mary clarence perhaps you are correct . 
clearly you have learned nothing . and you present an ongoing threat both to this convent and to yourself . 
mary clarence i have given you every opportunity .   to change .   to make a decent life for yourself . 
mary robert 's life was in danger ! your behavior was inexcusable ! 
i do n't believe we have anything to say to each other . 
months of work and the loom absolutely ruined ! 
good .   mary patrick i need you in the office .   mary clarence carry on . 
you are correct .   sometimes prayer alone can not help a situation .   such as your own for example .   how do you feel about physical labor ? 
we are nuns .   we seek solutions through prayer . 
this is a convent not a clinic .   we offer moral guidance not hardware . 
a balloon and a banana !   tell me mary clarence what were you thinking ? 
mary clarence ! 
come sister . 
girls this is sister mary clarence . she 'll be minding you until sister mary patrick 's return .   mary clarence please assign a biblical passage .   do not attempt discussion .   am i understood ? 
from all i 've heard just about everything .   your singing career seems all but nonexistent and your married lover wants you dead . 
i 'm sure .   if i were you i would use this time to think about my life .   and its direction .   or lack thereof . 
it is nine p.m.   pleasant dreams . 
your cell is more than adequate . 
and whom would you call ? 
useless distractions . 
our lives are simple .   we have little need for material possessions . 
your cell .   your room . 
this shall be your cell mary clarence . 
yes .   until breakfast . 
no food .   not until sundown . 
a fast .   to remind us of the poor of those who must endure without enough to eat . 
as a new member of our order i think you might also enjoy a ritual fast . 
until sundown . 
surely you are familiar with this practice mary clarence .   only when our lips are silent can our prayers truly be heard . 
sisters for the rest of the day we shall declare a vow of silence . 
and the vow of chastity . 
the vow of obedience . 
the mary is in deference to the holy mother the clarence in honor of saint clarence loyola .   there are three vows that every nun must accept .   the vow of poverty ... 
as of now and until you leave you are sister mary clarence . 
normally dressed you are a sore thumb and you endanger us all .   while you are here you will conduct yourself as a nun . only i shall know who and what you truly are .   you will not disrupt the convent .   you will not influence the sisters with your colorful street talk . you will draw no attention to yourself in any way . 
excused .   open the cabinet to your left . you will find appropriate attire . 
would you like that ? 
before we do you might like to freshen up .   and you 'll certainly want to change 
of course .   but it 's almost lunch . 
check your driver 's license . 
absolutely not .   i mean the wicked .   the heedless .   and their las vegas concubines . 
and all those like you . 
i joined this convent some thirty years ago .   at that time the world knew some measure of peace .   and hope .   our order was a beacon of hospitality to families to children to a neighborhood filled with promise .   and as the years have passed i have watched that promise destroyed .   drugs .   gangs .   spandex .   and . so i have made this convent an oasis a retreat from horror . and now that horror has invaded these sacred walls . 
it has come to pass . 
your cigarette -- out . 
miss van cartier . 
sit down . 
i see . 
the reason ? 
you were unhappy ? 
st. anne 's ? 
very well . 
enough joking . 
your name ? 
what is your full name ?   your christian name ? 
however we can also pray for other things . 
all right .   it 's a beginning .   las vegas nevada . 
she should n't have come back .   she knew she was in danger . 
mary clarence -- how is your weaving progressing ? 
i need to see you at once .   girls please excuse sister mary patrick for a few moments .   mary clarence ? 
sister mary patrick ? 
yes mary patrick ? 
but where ? 
but ... she was a showgirl .   she did n't have an old convent . 
calm down .   think clearly .   mary robert do you have any idea who those men were ? 
her whereabouts are unknown and we must proceed without her .   pull yourselves together . 
but bishop surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood . 
i lied . 
but bishop ... 
we 're a small convent bishop .   surely there are ... more appropriate shelters . 
but she 's been exposed to the underside of life .   she is the underside of life . 
absolutely not .   i am very sorry but no . 
sing and the devil will flee ! 
but then came an angel who whispered these words 
damnation was all i could see 
my soul was in danger i'd fallen from grace 
hurry sister ! 
this is so exhilarating !   all week long i ca n't wait till sunday when we sing . 
what is it mary ? 
we know you do n't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors . we 'll pray to find you some honest work . 
spring is here the sun will shine i'll be his and he'll be mine we'll love until the end of time and we'll never be lonely anymore 
am i ? 
the dixie cups ?   oh my .   i was just a girl .   of course .   spring is here the sun will shine 
i know .   it 's ancient . 
two days .   an hour or so . 
mary clarence could you ?   mary lazarus you 're terrific but ...   could you help us ? 
sure is !   come on in and sing a spell . 
shuttle beat shed .   and watch your heddles . 
you betcha . 
is n't it lovely ?   now i 'll demonstrate and then you can hop right in .   you just draw your beater in keep it pressed against the pick and open the shed .   then pass your shuttle beat and open the next shed .   shuttle . beat beat shuttle beat shed .   keep tension on the warp .   is that clear ? 
mary clarence .   goose .   we 're completely self - supporting .   like all convents . like yours . 
to sell of course .   i hate to say it but we 're in terrible trouble here at st. katherine 's .   we need a new roof the furnace is going and there 's no money . 
well it all comes back in just a jiffy .   i 'm working on a wall - hanging of the convent . 
the minute i saw you . i said to myself she 's a weaver .   have you ever used a loom ? 
1961 ?   ' 62 ?   mary clarence that 's when many of us took final vows .   it 's the last secular music we recall . 
i have n't heard that song in ages .   the ronettes ? 
is n't it a glorious morning ?   good morning mary clarence .   sleep well ? 
we 've got to save her ! 
look what she did with the choir .   she made us sing beautifully . 
we sound terrible    we need mary clarence . 
it should be here any minute . 
are you going to shoot us all tough guy ? 
peace on earth . 
she told us about one .   the little sisters of the moonlight .   in las vegas . 
but -- why would anyone kidnap a nun ? 
bless her !   there are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve .   that 's why many of us became nuns .   it 's marvelous reverend mother . 
oh she 's doing just fine reverend mother - 
reverend mother on behalf of the sisters i 'd like to welcome mary clarence to st. katherine 's . 
excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun ? 
but how do we get there ? 
it 's so beautiful ... 
she 's our inspiration ! 
she was n't a nun ? 
you mean -- they kidnapped her ? 
we 'll pray -- and she 'll be there . 
mary clarence !   sister ! 
maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us . 
mary clarence -- you should n't have . where did you get this ? 
but reverend mother -- everyone loves our new style . 
it 's better than ice cream . 
he 's kind . 
he 's not like other guys . 
we did it !   we actually sang a chord ! 
really mary clarence ?   were you a choirmistress ? 
which convent was that sister ? 
just sing ! 
you re okay -- for a civilian . 
van cartier . 
we could cut a demo .   look for a label . 
is there any syrup ? 
she 's a pro . 
right right cross with the left spin and turn ! 
tell me about it . 
wet behind the ears . 
of course .   i 'm a nun .   four popes now . the lord hates a loafer . 
i knew that . 
very nice .   sisters have we learned our lesson ?   i wo n't hold this little episode against anyone .   i 'll try not to . 
you 're a ringer .   she brought you in to replace me .   out with the old . 
free - lance ?   oh really ?   you think i do n't see ?   you think i took vows yesterday ?   i know what you 're up to . you and reverend mother . 
mary clarence are you with us ? 
soprano or alto ? 
i like my old convent in vancouver . out in the woods .   it was n't all modern like here .   no electricity .   cold water . bare feet .   those were nuns .   it was hell on earth but i loved it .   this place is a hilton . 
progressive convents .   vanity .   it sounds awful .   it sounds just like this place . 
enough jabber . 
we ca n't leave it up to the feds ! 
that should have tipped us . 
we 're losing it . 
dress rehearsal at four performance at 8:30 .   sharp . 
is it worth it ?   a lot of witnesses here . 
he said sing the devil away ! 
but the lord came to me 
i was hell - bound yes that 's what they say satan was waiting 
i was downhearted 
mary clarence ! 
but what do they want ?   where are we going ? 
wait this is n't the way .   who are you ? 
the council of cardinals !   i 'm so nervous !   what if i forget the words ? 
are you leaving us ? 
a thank - you ?   for what ?   you 're the one we should be thanking . 
we 're nuns ! 
honor thy mother and thy father too don't kill don't steal it 's bad for you 
i do n't want to mess anyone up ... 
now stop that .   you did n't shoot at me . you were only trying to help to give me experience .   i tried to explain that to reverend mother but -- i do n't know if she understood . 
we could have been killed !   but you saved me !   thank you mary clarence ! 
what was all that ?   who was that man ? why would he shoot at us ? 
oh my lord ! 
mary clarence ! 
mary clarence ! 
i ca n't wait to tell reverend mother about all my experiences .   i 've learned so much . 
mary clarence !   you 're so ... different from the other sisters .   sometimes well ... sometimes you sound more like a layperson . 
those people are wonderful !   why do n't we ever see them in church ? 
i 'm getting experience . 
who are all these people ? 
i have to do this .   so i can become a nun . 
experience !   right ? 
we need experience . 
mary clarence ! 
are you sure ? 
of course !   we must do it !   it 's the will of god !   what is it ? 
she says i should wait .   she says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life .   she says that i 'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet .   in a mature manner . 
oh . mary clarence i 'm so unworthy .   i want to take my final vows i would do it tomorrow but reverend mother wo n't let me ! 
no you do n't understand -- i do n't want to get out !   i want to get in ? 
you have to help me 
a novice . 
three years .   sister . 
mary robert .   i 'm ... mary robert . 
an extra heel of bread .   please take it you need your strength .   you 've been working so hard . 
i ... i brought you something . 
i ... i ... 
it 's after five .   we have to bathe . 
come on we 're late . 
not a note . 
mary clarence -- you 're alive ! 
a benedictine . 
the little sisters of the moonlight ! 
and what a lovely name .   las vegas ... 
well i do n't care who she is .   we ca n't sing without her ! 
an ... entertainer ? 
yes -- two men -- and they had guns . 
we ca n't sing without her !   what should we do ? 
it 's no use .   she just is n't here . 
mary clarence do n't be silly .   you 're an example to us all .   you 've taught us so much .   we 're singing for the cardinals and then -- who knows ?   maybe the choir can travel -- to schools and nursing homes . 
ice cream ! 
it 's brought people back to the church . 
it 's better than springtime . 
i 'd rather sing than do anything ! 
he 's decent . 
that was exciting ! 
mary clarence has a background in music . that 's what reverend mother said . 
is this like your old convent ? 
since mary clarence came to st. katherine 's i 've been shot at kidnapped by mafia hit men and i 've tasted beer . is that enough experience yet ?   for final vows ? 
reverend mother ? 
las vegas -- she 's here somewhere . 
she said they were from her old convent . 
i do n't understand .   where is she ? 
i ... i ca n't do this . 
quickly close it . 
what was that ? 
the church . 
where are we going ? 
speak the words constable .   what is stopping you ?   what has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality ? 
call me a liar then and a murderess . say it out and out . 
if you think i am behind this say it . 
yes i have seen that and i told you why i hid them . 
i have not been able to face him yet . 
he did not do these things .   if you knew him you would realize ... 
when ... when you spoke father 's name along with accusations i could not believe it .   i had to hide these ... at least till i could confront him myself . 
i have been reading your journal . i 'm sorry .   i found it too fascinating to resist .   i rode to catch up with you at the notary out of curiosity .   before i found you though i overheard what you were said . 
what is so urgent ? 
i 'm drawing bad blood from the wound . 
the skull is gone . 
my god ... what has happened ? 
what are you doing ? 
what did you say ? 
but i am not alone am i ?   i only wished to see what you were up to and ...   to thank you . 
i apologize if i worried you . 
it is only me . 
if you want me to go i will .   do you want me to leave ? 
she died .   her lungs were diseased ... two years ago .   what is this about ? 
no but ... why do you ask that ? 
what has happened ? 
the things i said to you before ... i was wrong to say them . 
what troubles you ? 
you falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it .   ca n't you see ? you 'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it . 
but why ?   tell me why . 
take a lesson from young masbath 's desires ichabod crane .   he follows with you to avenge his father 's death . that i understand .   but what do you want ? 
what is it then ?   scientific method ? how can any of this matter in the slightest ? 
and this gives worth to butchery ? 
must i hear this ? 
what are you on about ? 
i have misjudged you i think .   i did not imagine you were so cruel . 
why would you do such a thing ? 
wo n't they still have that justice ?   or was it a vain promise ? 
people have put their trust in you . 
you promised justice . 
that would be a pity .   those words might show you something you 've never seen before . 
i insist that you have it . 
then i also have a gift for you . true magic which even you will not be able to deny . 
oh you are hopeless .   may i keep it at least ? 
do n't you see why ?   look closely a moment .   put your intellect aside .   ca n't you see what is inexplicable ? 
you made this and the drawings ? 
yes he does .   may i try ? 
it would be interesting to find out . 
these scars .   how did you get them ? 
you pay great attention to small things .   i hide these as i hide all my books .   father would not approve lest it were the bible . 
you do not disturb me .   please stay . having trouble sleeping ? 
you are funny . 
really ?   then ... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom or even in a teardrop ? 
to call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic but not all magic is black . 
not all think it is the horseman . many say witches come from the western woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons .   some believe a person in this very town kneels before lucifer offering death as tribute .   and still others believe none of it . 
i 've read a great deal about your new york city .   do be a dear and tell me all about it .   sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life . 
he has proposed to me twice . 
i 'll be back in a little bit then . 
all right y' all gon na go with me ? 
would y' all like that ? 
it went real good . 
we 'll go to church and get you baptized tomorrow 's sunday . you go on back to bed . 
what do you want hun ? 
that might be better than this . 
you 're not stayin ' here tonight . go get sober before you come back . i 'm tired of my child seein ' this . now you get yourself straight or i 'll lock your ass out of my life for good . 
this is not your house doyle . this is my house and i 'll say who stays and goes . you 've got a house why do n't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it . 
he do n't want to doyle . do n't go vaughan if you do n't want to . you 'll wreck doyle you 're drunk . 
karl you better clap your hands or he 'll just keep on . 
no doyle . vaughan do n't want to come to a party with you . 
please do n't . not tonight . i 'm not up for it . they always stay till mornin ' . i 'm just give out doyle . 
please doyle do n't .

i just feel sorry for the poor thing . 
let 's go vaughan .   frank we 'll be back in a little while . i 'll bring you back somethin' . you 're food 's in the oven warmin ' over . 
frank why do n't you go off and play in your room if doyle 's gon na talk nasty . 
you 're not crippled . get in there and make somethin' . 
he 'll be here in a little while he 's takin ' me to get an ice cream . 
yeah that 's right frank you better ask him . i mean do n't hurt his feelin 's or anything but it would be good to know . i 'm sure it 's nothin' . he seems real sweet . 
he 's just mentally retarded i guess . 
doyle you 're awful . you should n't be that way . 
i know honey . just remember what i said we 'll bide our time . you just steer clear of him as much as you can . doyle 's had a real hard life . it 's just about run him crazy i think . 
well at least he 's tryin ' . but who knows for how long . 
i promise we 're gon na get away from him . the time has to be right that 's all . i 'd rather him get tired of me and leave me . then he would n't want to hurt me . he would n't care then . we 'll be fine . i promise . you go to bed now .   i love you . 
yeah honey someday everything 's gon na be all right . 
i know he does . 
i guess . he went to the garage . poor thing he 's probably never seen such a crazy mess . he probably wants to go back and live in mr. cox 's shop . 
yeah he has to go to work in a little while . i do too . 
what are you doin' up again frank ? you need to get a little sleep . 
no honey we do n't .   i 'll make some coffee and start cleanin ' up this mess . karl you want some coffee huh ? 
i 'm fine honey . let 's just try and forget about tonight . 
he 's no more an indian than i am though . anyhow doyle 's gon na try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends . just like he does to frank and me sometimes . you just ignore it . or stay out here away from 'em if he 'll let you . he 's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he 'll get drunk . i guarantee it . 
karl now listen there 's gon na be a party tonight here at the house . doyle 's invited his music - playin ' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio . 
i 'm glad of it honey . 
how come karl wo n't eat here with us ? 
maybe you and karl want to go with us ? 
frank told me about your situation . and frank loves company . you know especially after his daddy passed and all . there ai n't no sense in you stayin ' in that old greasy shop .   he 's mentally retarded poor thing . 
nice to meet you karl . 
hey sweetheart . what you up to ? 
we sure like havin' you . 
well thank you hun . that 's real good of you to say . i would n't know what to do without him either .

you 're a hell of a boy frank . someday you 're gon na get all the good things you deserve . and karl here 's gon na get some more biscuits tonight . what do you think about that ? 
karl why do n't you and melinda go take a walk . it 's nice out . 
i believe you . i really do . 
was that you ? i remember that . i was only three or four but i always heard about it growin ' up .   they say you 're well ? 
that 's okay . it 's not really my business . i have wondered though . why was it ? was it like a nervous breakdown ? 
it 's all right .   you know i was thinkin ' there 's this girl that works with me . she 's real heavy but she 's cute in the face . well you know she 's slow . she 's a little bit i think . she 's not retarded just -- it do n't matter listen to me . i thought you might like to meet her . vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her . would you like that ? 
well set down and i 'll make some biscuits and gravy . 
well it is nearly breakfast time anyway . i ca n't go to sleep . i have to be at work in three hours . you know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two you feel worse than if you had n't slept at all ? 
right now ? 
i 'll be dog .

you scared me . 
karl this is my boyfriend doyle . frank why do n't you and karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin' . vaughan you ready to go ?

vaughan do n't get pushy . 
hey karl you know what ? melinda was voted employee of the month at the dollar store last february . is n't that somethin' ? 
i do n't think he sees you as a guy guy . 
he 's retarded 's all . you know he 's always after a father figure and lord knows doyle ai n't a good one with his mean ass . 
frank 's just crazy about him . he likes the way he talks . he helped him carry home the clean laundry . 
i know . 
frank do n't talk that way . who 's that strange lookin ' man behind you ? did he follow you in here ? 
why wo n't he talk to women ? 
no we have to get this story . 
do you smell shit ? 
in a few minutes we 're gon na be in a room with a killer . that does n't bother you ? 
will he be supervised ? 
where will he go ? 
i did n't mean that . 
is he leaving right this minute ? 
can i ask you a question ? if he 's so troubled why are you letting him out ? what if he does it again ? it happens all the time . 
how am i going to conduct an interview if i ca n't ask him any questions ? 
that 's really strange . what does it mean ? 
before they were married ? 
i knew he slept in a toolshed . 
ca n't you talk to him ? maybe talk him into it . i 'm a real good interviewer . just get me in the room with him . 
well what do we do ? we drove all the way out here . 
no thank you . 
well yeah it 's for the school newspaper . but it has pictures . i mean it 's a regular paper you know . 
yes sir . 
nice to meet you . i 'm marsha dwiggins and this is theresa evans . she 's here to take the pictures . 
i once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the united states have at least one relative who has lived in brooklyn at one time or another . 
and what are you his chaperone ? 
ah - hah i see . a cozy dinner . but are n't threesomes a little awkward ? how does the phrase go-- 
and how many people will be attending this birthday party ? 
and what 's the occasion of this celebration ? 
an invitation ? 
no ! at least i do n't think i am ! 
wonderful . when your next book is published maybe you could come into the store and do a signing . i 'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up . 
okay . i 'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow .   it does n't seem to be too long . 
i get off for lunch in ten minutes . can i treat you to a hamburger ? 
i 'd love to . 
almost done . a week or ten days and i 'll be there . 
it 's been a while . i thought maybe you 'd be in touch . 
what happened ? 
jesus what happened to you ? 
which explains why this has n't been the easiest summer of my life . 
that 's the subject of my last chapter . 
of course i fool around . but not so much when it comes to my work it 's true .   have you ever read pierre or the ambiguities ? 
visions of utopia in nineteenth - century american fiction . 
american literature . what else ? 
it 's just a summer job . something to help pay the bills while i finish my dissertation . 
muncie indiana . he and my mother met as students . but i 'm from brooklyn . my sisters and i were all born and bred right here . 
until she was twelve . she moved here in ' forty - nine . 
i keep waiting for the next novel to come out . anything in the works ? 
i thought i recognized you . you 're paul benjamin the writer are n't you ? 
will that be cash or charge ? 
anything auggie . just name it . 
i 'm sorry baby . i ca n't help it . 
i ca n't believe it . oh god i ca n't believe it .   you 're an angel auggie . an angel from heaven . 
for keeps ? 
and you 're giving it to me ? 
jesus god auggie . there 's money in here . 
what 's this ? 
bully for you . 
are you calling me a liar ? i 'm telling you i 'm broke . i do n't even have insurance on my goddamned car . 
i 'd never be able to talk her into it . and even if i could those things cost money . and that 's just what i do n't have . i 'm flat out dead broke . 
dream on auggie . she 'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday . 
yeah ? and what else am i supposed to do ? there 's no baby anymore and if she wants to throw away her life that 's her business . 
i do n't have much choice do i ? it 's pretty clear she does n't want me around . 
you told me you wanted to meet him . wellhere he is . 
when i told her i was going to bring her father she kind of melted . it 's the first time felicity 's talked nice to me since she left home . she 's dying to meet you auggie . 
she looks just like you . 
wait till you see her auggie . 
that i was n't bullshitting you sweetheart . at least you 'll know i 've been telling the truth . 
relax okay ? you do n't have to do anything . just go in there and pretend . it wo n't kill you to do a little favor like that . besides you might even learn something . 
it was the only way auggie . otherwise she was n't going to let me see her . 
i told her she was going to meet her father . 
dammit auggie do n't ask so many questions . just get in the car . 
just get in and shut up . i 'm not asking you to do anything . i just need you to come with me . 
get in auggie . i 've got something to show you . 
you 're a cold - hearted bastard are n't you ? how 'd you ever get so mean auggie ? 
i thought i could handle it . i did n't want to bug you . i thought i could handle it on my own but i could n't . she 's in real bad auggie . 
who the hell knows ?   he dropped out of sight fifteen years ago . 
then why do you think i married frank ? i was already pregnant and i did n't have much time . say what you like but at least he gave my kid a name . 
and that 's how felicity came into the picture . during one of those two seconds . 
it fizzled baby . that 's the way it goes . but we had our times did n't we ? it was n't all bad . 
it was over with bill before you ever came home . maybe you do n't remember it now but you were pretty hot to see me back then . 
you did n't write to me for more than a year . what was i supposed to think ? 
why would i lie to you auggie ? you think it was easy to come here and walk into this place ? why would i do it if i did n't have to ? 
i do n't know who else to turn to auggie . 
her name is felicity and she just turned eighteen .   she ran away from pittsburgh last year and now she 's living in some shit - hole here in brooklyn with a guy named chico . strung out on crack four months pregnant .   i ca n't bear to think about that baby . our grandchild auggie . just think of it . our grandchild . 
do n't rush me okay ? you 're jumping to conclusions before i 've even said anything .   and besides it 's not for me .   it 's for our daughter . 
like what you 're doing . i 'm not going to eat you up .   i need your help and if you keep staring at me like that . i might start screaming . 
do n't look at me like that . auggie . it gives me the creeps . 
this is private auggie . just between you and i. 
i 've got something to talk to you about and the least you can do is listen . you owe me that much . i drove all the way from pittsburgh to see you and i 'm not going until you 've heard me out . 
you always were a son - of - a - bitch were n't you ? a little weasel with a quick dirty mouth . 
i do n't want to talk about it .   if you really want to know . i lost it . and i 'm not sorry i did . that eye was cursed auggie and it never gave me nothing but grief . 
you 're looking good auggie . 
eighteen and a half years . 
what are you talking about ? 
your baby . the baby you 're carrying around inside you . 
you can do whatever you want with your own life . we 're thinking of the baby that 's all . we want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby . before it 's too late . 
be nice sweetie . we 're just here to help you . 
i do n't know . hello mom . hello dad . something like that . 
are n't you going to say anything ? 
it 's me honey . it 's mom . 
henry told cyrus he 'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again . when henry makes a threat like that people tend to take him seriously . 
no i do n't suppose it has . he was broken up like nobody 's business in that hospital when he found out louisa was dead . 
jesus had nothing to do with it . if he 'd been involved . he would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did . 
do n't put words in my mouth . what i 'm saying is she drove off in cyrus 's car and went to the five - spot lounge with him for a drink . what i 'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car he was in no shape to drive . but he drove the car anyway and before he could get her back to where she lived the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck . louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed . cyrus lived but he came out of it a cripple . his left arm was so mangled the doctors had to cut it off . small punishment for what he did if you ask me . 
his father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born . louisa was henry 's younger sister and she and the baby moved in with us . four or five years go by and then one day cyrus shows up out of the blue tail between his legs wanting to patch things up with louisa . i thought henry was going to tear cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door . they 're both big men those two and if they ever started to tangle you 'd see some teeth jumping on the floor . i guarantee it ... so cyrus persuaded louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet . and the poor girl never came back . 
i figured he had a right to know . 
well one thing i suppose but i do n't think it has anything to do with this .   a friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she 'd spotted thomas 's father working at some gas station outside of peekskill . 
no thank you . 
he 's in trouble all right . but i do n't have any idea what it is . 
which brings me back to my original question . what was he doing here in the first place ? 
his mother 's dead and he has n't seen his father in twelve years . 
he goes to john jay high school in brooklyn . 
i always knew that boy had an imagination but now he 's gone and made up a whole new life for himself .   do you mind if i sit down ?   he 's been living with me and his uncle henry since he was a baby . and we do n't live in manhattan . we live in boerum hill . in the projects . 
his parents ? is that what he told you ? his parents ? 
i just want to know where he is . 
and what was he doing here in the first place ? that 's what i want to know . what 's a man like you messing around with a black boy like thomas for ? are you some kind of pervert or what ? 
rashid ? rashid ! is that what he told you his name was ? 
thomas cole . thomas jefferson cole . my nephew . 
do n't give me any of that . i know he 's been here . you ca n't fool me mister . 
i 'm looking for my nephew   thomas . 
what do you mean how 'd i get in ? i pushed the door and walked in . what do you think ? 
i just want to know what your game is mister that 's all . 
is your name paul benjamin ? 
you 're implying th ... 
it seems human .   to me . 
we were afraid .   silence seemed better .   to come forward seemed like a mistake . 
trials are n't only about truth mr. hooks .   even though they should be .   they 're about what people < u > believe</u > is true . 
because the facts could be misconstrued as murder . 
we discussed that .   and decided not to . 
yes and then what was there to call about ?   everything was up in the air . 
of course not .   we 're just not quick to run and boast .   in case something went wrong . 
closer to eight . 
we hear how carl ... passed away . only a few hours later . 
happy for him .   and relieved . 
i said ' excited ' .   not agitated he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed . 
it 's not for the .   they only get to convict him . 
did you write that column ? 
you have to hear this i can never touch you ishmael .   not once not ever .   there 's no half- way .   as much as i know it hurts you you have to let this go . 
i 'm married ishmael .   it is n't right for us to be alone .   people will t ... 
i 'm sorry about your arm .   kabuo and i.   are very sor ... 
i do n't mean everyone .   just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them .   or run a newspaper . 
look at my face .   it 's the face of the people who did that .   my father hardly speaks english .   we 're in bad trouble you have to see that . 
my father ca n't get our money from the bank .   we have a few dol ... 
i lie to my parents every day . and every night . 
i can just feel my spirits soar . 
my mom .   would be the problem . 
we 're japanese not mexican ishmael . he 'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword . 
easy .   slow is best . 
he 's still got a good grip .   we need to dig more . 
he 's going to south america to marry some other girl - that 's what they call high finance . 
junior gave it to me .   it must have at least thirty stones - 
you like it ? 
and talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries . 
of course not .   as a matter of fact it was just the other way around .   you see he needs help . 
i thought i heard voices - and i just had to talk to somebody .   i do n't feel like going to sleep . 
yes .   he wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he 's going to pick me up at the pier . 
i hope so . 
i met one of them . 
do you suppose she went out shopping ? 
believe it or not - josephine predicted the whole thing . 
well i 'll come back later . 
i guess she 's not in here . 
we do n't have to run . 
will she be surprised . i just ca n't wait to see her face - 
if i 'd been watching my step i never would have met him .   wait till i tell josephine . 
now look daphne - hands off - i saw him first . 
come on daphne . 
or was it bryn mawr ? 
it sleeps twelve .   this is my friend daphne . she 's a vassar girl . 
i recognized him too - his picture was in vanity fair . 
run along daphne - i 'll catch up with you . 
you 're so flat - chested .   clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me . 
but there 's one thing i envy you for . 
i mean your shoulders - and your arms - 
you know daphne - i had no idea you were such a big girl . 
what do you think you 're doing ? 
oh i have some suntan lotion . 
we 'll rent some at the bathhouse . how about you josephine ? 
a bunch of us girls are going for a swim . want to come along ? 
thank you daphne . 
i 'm just going to get some ice . 
and bring the cocktail shaker . 
we have some bourbon - lets make manhattans . 
here .   this 'll put hair on your chest . 
what 's the surprise ? 
i may spill something . 
you better put on the lights . i ca n't see what i 'm doing . 
how 's the bottle ? 
you all right ? 
you got some ? 
i have a very low resistance . 
maybe i 'd better go before i catch something . 
what did you say ? 
let me warm them a little .   there - is n't that better ? 
and you 've got cold feet . 
and your head is hot . 
why you poor thing - you 're trembling all over . 
anything wrong ? 
when i was a little girl on cold nights like this i used to crawl into bed with my sister .   we 'd cuddle up under the covers and pretend we were lost in a dark cave and were trying to find out way out . 
i 'm not crowding you am i ? 
i 'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep . 
i do n't want her to know we 're in cahoots . 
sssh .   sweet sue . 
if there 's anything i can do for you - 
if it had n't been for you they would have kicked me off the train .   i 'd be out there in the middle of nowhere sitting on my ukulele . 
i wanted to thank you for covering for me . you 're a real pal . 
good night honey . 
see you around girls . 
are my seams straight ? 
i do n't want you to think that i 'm a drinker . i can stop any time i want to - only i do n't want to .   especially when i 'm blue . 
i do n't really have much of a voice - but then it 's not much of a band either .   i 'm only with 'em because i 'm running away . 
i 'm sugar cane . 
that 's all right .   i was afraid it was sweet sue . you wo n't tell anybody will you ? 
that 's right - pour it on .   talk me out of it . 
i know .   every time ! 
i told you - i 'm not very bright . 
how can i ?   no matter where i go there 'll always be a shell station on the corner .   i 'll bring this back when it 's empty . 
he was the first nice guy i ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything . 
i do n't know .   all of a sudden i 'm thirsty . 
well anchors aweigh you have a bon voyage .   and if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding we 'll be through here in a couple of weeks . 
i did n't do anything .   it just happened . 
real diamonds .   they must be worth their weight in gold .   are you always this generous ? 
yes they 're here .   oh - white orchids .   would you believe it - i have n't had white orchids since i was a debutante .   what 's this ? 
but you have .   you 've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow i 'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of venezuelan oil . 
oh of course .   i understand .   at least i think i do . 
oh - that kind of a merger .   is she young ? pretty ? 
you 're not ? 
a merger ?   how long will you be gone ? 
where to ?   south america ?   oh . that is unexpected . 
tomorrow night ? 
i 'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show . 
that 's funny - i never slept better .   and i had the most wonderful dream .   i was still on the yacht and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and i was the crew - i kept a lookout for icebergs and i sorted your shells and mixed your cocktails and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when i woke up i felt like swimming right back to you . 
daphne has a beau - i have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you . 
that 's wonderful .   poor josephine . 
from a rich millionaire . 
i 'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - i think he 's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve . 
nice ?   it was suicidally beautiful . 
oh no .   i 'm off that stuff - for good . 
eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars . 
good morning . 
oh you know - junior league - charity bazaars - i used to sell kisses for the milk fund . 
mineral baths - now really ! 
thank you . 
i must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up . 
lets throw another log on the fire . 
well - ? 
so inhale ! 
you 're not giving yourself a chance . do n't fight it .   relax . 
would you like a little more champagne ?   and maybe if we had some music -   - how do you dim these lights ? 
anything this time ? 
i may not be dr. freud or a mayo brother or one of those french upstairs girls - but could i take another crack at it ? 
would you do me a favor ? 
do n't talk like that .   i 'm sure there must be some girl some place that could - 
maybe if you saw a good doctor ... 
is that anything ? 
have you ever tried american girls ? 
is it that hopeless ? 
how can you think about food at a time like this ? 
you poor poor boy . 
talk about sad . 
oh no ! 
oh you could n't possibly . 
what happened ? 
you mean you ca n't fall in love ? 
that makes me feel just awful . 
nothing at all ? 
have you tried ? 
you mean - like frigid ? 
what thing ? 
harmless - how ? 
well of course i 'm sure you 're a gentleman . 
it 's not the icebergs .   but there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this . 
you know i 've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean . 
you mean we 're alone on the boat ? 
what 's on thursdays ? 
where 's your shell collection ? 
water polo - is n't that terribly dangerous ? 
look at all that silverware . 
bon voyage . 
i do n't mind if i do . 
a herring ?   is n't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars ? 
what is it ? 
what a beautiful fish . 
it 's exquisite - like a floating mansion . 
oh - in here . 
oh you have an upstairs and a downstairs . 
love it .   which way ? 
my dad is more interested in railroads . baltimore and ohio .   which is the port and which is the starboard ? 
it looked so small from the beach - but when you 're on it it 's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer . 
it 's not how long it takes - it 's who 's taking you . 
looks like they 're on the wrong track . 
it 's sort of funny - you being out of gas - i mean shell oil and everything - 
it 's the thought that counts . 
thank you .   and thank you for the flowers . 
been waiting long ? 
oh josephine - just imagine - me sugar kowalczyk from sandusky ohio on a millionaire 's yacht .   if my mother could only see me now - 
for me ?   it 's shell oil . 
i guess he 's not going to show up - it 's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot ? 
because he said he 's coming to hear us play - maybe . 
anyway you 're going to meet him tonight . 
oh i 'm not going to let this one get away . he 's so cute - collects shells . 
well he 's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he 's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers . 
shell oil junior .   he 's got millions - he 's got glasses - and he 's got a yacht . 
the most wonderful thing happened - 
and you will come to hear us tonight ? 
well i guess i 'd better go - 
yes you 're in the way .   he 's waiting for a signal from his yacht . 
shell oil ? 
you collect shells ? 
i thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play . 
maybe i 'll tell you when i know you a little better .   what are you doing tonight ? 
you see i have this theory about men with glasses . 
you 're very kind .   i 'll bet you 're also very gentle - and helpless - 
- and always the same four hundred . 
- opening of the opera - 
they do indeed .   daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent but i do n't care . it was such a bore - coming - out parties cotillions - 
so do i.   as a matter of fact i spent three years at the sheboygan conservatory of music . 
yeah .   real hot . 
oh yes .   quite .   you know - vassar bryn mawr - we 're only doing this for a lark . 
well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel . sweet sue and her society syncopators . 
no - the ukulele .   and i sing . 
i 'll bet just while we were talking you made like a hundred thousand dollars . 
how 's the stock market ? 
that 's very interesting . 
i 'm not interested at all . 
and who mixes the cocktails - your wife ? 
i quite agree .   tell me who runs up that flat - your wife ? 
which one is yours - the big one ? 
you have a yacht ? 
your view of what ? 
that must be it . 
your face is familiar . 
are you staying at the hotel ? 
have n't i seen you somewhere before ? 
who are you ? 
well do n't worry .   i wo n't sue you - no matter who you are . 
i do n't think so . 
my fault . 
she does n't need one .   i do n't have one either . 
what makes you so sure ? 
what else ?   and was i ever crazy about him . two in the morning he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad so i brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face . 
414 - that 's the same room number i had in cincinnati - my last time around with a male band . what a heel he was . 
i wish they 'd put us in the same room . 
i 'll bet there is n't one of them under seventy - five . 
thanks honey . 
would you mind terribly ? 
bienstock .   he snores to beat the band . we cut cards to see who sleeps over him and i always lose .   would n't you know ? 
i might as well stay in there . i wo n't be able to sleep anyway . 
what 's happened ? 
happy days . 
they get those weak eyes from reading - you know all those long columns of tiny figures in the wall street journal . 
men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless . have n't you ever noticed ? 
i want mine to wear glasses . 
maybe you 'll meet one too josephine . 
oh i do n't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste . 
millionaires .   flocks of them .   they all go south for the winter .   like birds . 
about the future .   you know - like a husband ?   that 's why i 'm glad we 're going to florida . 
that 's a quarter of a century . makes a girl think . 
you know i 'm going to be twenty - five in june ? 
i can tell you one thing - it 's not going to happen to me again .   ever . i 'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop . 
so you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job and the next saxophone player and it 's the same thing all over again .   see what i mean ? - not very bright . 
then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone and all that 's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste all squeezed out . 
you do n't know what they 're like . you fall for them and you love 'em - you think it 's going to be the biggest thing since the graf zeppelin - and the next thing you know they 're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses - 
that 's why i joined this band . safety first .   anything to get away from those bums . 
but you 're a girl thank goodness . 
every time ! 
you see i have this thing about saxophone players . 
i ca n't trust myself .   the moment i 'd start with a new band - bingo ! 
i 'll say . 
that 's what i 'm running away from . i worked with six different ones in the last two years .   oh brother ! 
have you ever been with a male band ? 
i used to sing with male bands . but i ca n't afford it any more . 
no just dumb .   if i had any brains i would n't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls ' band . 
i 'm not very bright i guess . 
better keep a lookout . 
put it here . 
all the girls drink - but i 'm the one that gets caught .   that 's the story of my life . i always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop . 
do n't get me started on that .   want a drink ?   it 's bourbon . 
i play the ukulele .   and i sing too . 
on the baltimore and ohio . 
yes .   i come from a very musical family . my mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor . 
if they catch me once more they 'll boot me out of the band .   you the replacement for the bass and the sax ? 
wow . you look beautiful . 
sure disappear . weve been walking away our whole lives . 
you practically bribed him with your erector set . 
we were eating and puking together in harmony until one day tony walked me home from school . he was my first boyfriend .   i was fourteen . 
are you sure youre okay ? 
what ? why ? what do you mean ? 
but i do . i will . youre my sister . 
do you want to come in for a minute ? we could talk about-- 
pub golf ? 
why dont you get my half sister her seventh hole ? 
drunk isnt the same thing as happy amy . 
christ amy . 
did amy tell you she keeps her homecoming tiara by the bed ? 
except its scotch . 
theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you ? 
she did ? 
mom please . 
trust me . this is bigger than tony pee - pants . 
i was pretty hard on her last night .   and now shes getting married . 
so dad rang the bell and when tony pee - pants opened the door i threw the tart at him and popped his stitches . 
she blames tony pee - pants pinterello for everything . the fall of the british empire the cold war the internet . 
oh no .   she tells this story at every major holiday . 
id be happy to . youre welcome . 
sir yes sir ! 
moms refining her strategy for dday . 
my mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture . she thinks its-- 
wheres nick sleeping ? 
im sorry ? 
its the past . its nothing but ghosts . so just get it off your chest then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu . 
well it was a big deal . as late as ... yesterday . or this morning .   but not anymore . 
relax . take a breath and just say it . its no big deal . i promise . 
when we were together i was too here now im not here enough . 
is this supposed to be an apology ? 
not for a dog . 
seven if you count the on - and - off years . which i do . 
so whats your point ? 
that was a long time ago . 
um news flash : i dont give a shit . 
its called character . god youre predictable . 
whoa jeffrey . slow down . you and me were the past . im not sure if you noticed but im here with someone else . 
so tell me hows unmarried life ? 
maybe not her least ... theres always-- 
hey you ! 
hey yourself .   i see youve met my ex . 
why jeffrey . hello . 
thank you . 
what ? ! no no . you cant-- 
youre right . i was so desperate to make everyone believe i was happy that i spent six grand on a lie . and after all that ? the only one who ended up falling for it was me . 
you let me make a fool of myself ! you lied to me ! i dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do . its your job . its who you are . how would you even know if something were real ? 
youve always got that to hide behind dont you ? its just business ! 
he bled a bunch but no there was no peeing . 
i didnt say he was worth it . 
spontaneously combust ? 
what would you do if you were n't an escort ? 
so whyd you say yes to me ? 
you have had girlfriends ? 
im sorry i was such a bitch . i really appreciate your doing this . 
he was about to un - stick me !   i paid you to help me get closure . 
oh cut the crap ! 
but nothing did . 
and what if i didnt want you to ... to do that to me ? 
so youre telling me . if something had happened last night ... it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars ? thats a down payment on a ford focus ! 
not if you take an advance on your credit card . 
of course not . how ... how could it be ? nothing happened . 
are you sure ? 
come on . 
show me . 
oh come on . youre like the yoda of escorts . 
this is awkward for me .   talking about it makes me feel better . 
my sixth - grade science project was entitled love hurts : the heartbreak of human papillomavirus. trust me im careful . 
i guess so . 
what ? ! 
so ... what was i ... oh yeah . do you honestly think that i want to be single and miserable ? that i want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart . 
and you thought id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries ? 
you shit ! 
oh no . 
shampoo got it ! 
if it makes you feel any better to get your number i had to cough up two round - trip tickets to amsterdam and a case of mini - baileys . 
i have a friend at the magazine . 
well happen in the sense that i picked up the phone tracked you down flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401k. 
sorry . im a little nervous . i never thought something like this would happen to me . 
not you . youre not disgusting . youre lovely . just the idea that theyd bring an escort . i mean a stranger who um didnt ... who never .... i mean someones dead . 
i think thats disgusting . 
a wedding . 
have you ever done anything like this before ? 
i do ? 
what is ? 
graham russell and russell hitchcock . 
im desperate to start but i dont have an addictive personality . except for approval . that i cant get enough of . 
that wont be an issue believe me . i find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant .   no offense . 
how does it feel to get that much money just for being you ? 
six thousand right ? 
im compulsive and weird ? 
no count it anyway . 
what does your gut say ? 
what did he say exactly ? i mean you dont think he wants me back ? 
of course he is . im here with my new man .   i love it ! your magics already working . let the suffering begin . 
jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé . 
well he looks miserable . what were you talking about ? 
oh yeah .   so we split it . you know as in share. people do that . 
i dont do naked . my sister ? she does naked . 
mmm nice dress ? or mmm--   gorgeous i was insane to let you go ! 
really ?   dont get too attached . 
yeah but i feel like crap . and if you feel like crap its way better to look hot while youre doing it . 
dont patronize me . theyve clearly been at this a while . 
you have feet ? 
exactly . i want us to look like we fit but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit .   its welcome cocktails not prom . with this level of matchy - matchy we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere . 
hi . hey . 
you knew ? 
dad made me go over and apologize the next day . 
you didnt have to do that . 
you have more than one gynecologist ? 
of course dont be silly . 
yes ? no . what ?   save the patter for the tourists . 
not exactly . i wear it .   on my right hand . and only rarely . 
give it back ? are you nuts ? 
i get all the glamour jobs . 
hey sal . 
its complicated dad . 
thats not true . we checked for leaks a few years back .   good morning . 
meet nick . 
shes drunk . -er than me . but i didnt really dump you did i ? 
i havent thought about that in years . 
i thought you were living in san francisco . or was it nepal ? 
 ... but its getting there .  
im worried . amys not good at drinking . she gets sooo drunk sooo fast . does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker ?   is it drunker or drunker - er ? 
means you keep me using my head and that 's good ! 
whewwww ! you sure keep my mind jumping boy ! 
and so you did your job right ? 
i ca n't answer that for you -- but it 's no fault of your own that you do n't know where your father is now . you tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father .   come on tell me ... 
but you did all you could david . not many little boys could 've gone on such a journey as you did . 
well you should n't worry about him too much david . 
you think about your father a lot do n't you ? 
what are you looking at out there ? there 's nothing to see . 
not now david it 's time for bed . you have a long trip ahead of you in the morning ... 
you could ? how ? 
you know that was a good thing you did for clarence in class today . i believed his story but i was afraid the other children would n't ... 
because all you could think of was getting away from the guard . 
well how did you like the class david ? 
now do n't you think it 's time you told me all about yourself ? 
he 'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed . 
and you 're a tired little boy . i 'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep . 
why do n't you sit and i 'll read you something he said . 
dr. william e. b. dubois . 
here 's one by a man that 's very much alive . 
that 's where we came from first . 
here it is right here . 
they lived a long time ago -- before you and i were born . 
that 's right-- 
i try ... 
i do n't live far from here . you and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we 'll talk about how to get you back home . 
that does it ... 
did your mother know you were going to see your father ? 
it 's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this ? 
you keep looking around david . do n't you go to school ? 
let me see it ... 
my name is camille -- camille johnson and i 'm the supervisor of this school . what 's your name ? 
here you put your hand under the water and i 'll pump for you . 
is he here in borderdale ? 
you do n't live around here do you ? 
can you swim ? 
clarence would you tell us a story that was not true after telling us it was ? 
how was your sister after you pulled her out of the water ? 
go on ... 
you know that the class is going to challenge your story do n't you clarence ? 
be good and be smart little boy . 
what 's wrong nathan ? 
it 's when the heat is so bad dogs go crazy . 
what 's wrong with him david ? 
but who 's gon na help me here with the house and in the field ? 
how can you do that ? you do n't live anywhere near that school . 
miss johnson must be a real kindly lady . 
who 's miss johnson ? 
what 's that you carryin ' ? 
i guess they musta sent ' i m to another camp . 
did you find your father ? 
ask your daddy to give you some word about when he 'll be comin ' home -- and tell ' i m we love him . 
here 's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest go into a church or railroad station -- but do n't go into nobody 's house you hear me ? 
i wish you would n't take the dog with you david -- he 's likely to be a burden to you . 
good night ... 
yes son . you better get back to bed . 
no i do n't and i ought n't not to after the way you 've taken over since they took him away -- and i would like for you to see ' i m so you can come back and tell me about ' i m.   the field 's all planted so i guess i can spare you for a little while . when do you wanta leave ? 
but you 'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes where will you sleep ? i ca n't send you away from here like that ! 
so did i. i figured when the time got right we could all take a day or two and walk up there but it 's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone . 
ca n't sleep ? 
good ! but you do n't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it ! you 'll get that woman in trouble ! 
poor creature ... 
what is it david lee ? 
i think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot . i do n't think he 's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself . 
any sign of sounder ? 
you sure can son ... 
no son . we havta wait ' til the holiday comes -- anyway they wo n't let womenfolk see their men no time . 
' bye son -- i wo n't be gone long . 
david come back here ! 
children come here ... 
same as we -- they pray . 
nobody yet -- it 's all tied up . 
when you get outta that school you come right on back home y' all gon ' have to take this laundry work i done for miss boatwright today . 
you got two shirts on ? 
tuck that shirt in david lee . 
where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school . 
that 's right ! 
david lee it 's time for you to get to bed ! 
at the way you ask funny questions josie mae ! 
might be ... 
because he cared so damn much about you and me child . 
do n't take all day at that table david lee . 
why do n't you pay him a visit mr. howard ? he 'll tell you all about it . 
the season is a long way off mr. howard and by that time nathan oughta be home . if he ai n't believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops . we have to because we owe you all that money -- mr. howard . 
i need some nutmeg flour eggs sugar and ... 
i did n't say nothin' 'bout credit mr. howard . 
i wanta get some things . 
i brought these walnuts to trade . 
where you goin' ! ? 
it 's lunchtime and i wanna have a talk with you nathan lee . come on children ... 
i see all right -- it 's time for us to get out of this field . 
is there something i can do to help you ? 
you sure you feel up to it nathan ? 
to invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree drink ice cold whiskey and just shoot the breeze ! 
the most important thing is that you 're home !   we was gon na have cold eatin ' tonight 'cause of the heat but now i 'm goin' to cook ! 
if there ever was a devil in this county ike you is it ! 
little chilly . 
you ready to eat ? 
good mornin ' nathan . 
we been through these off - seasons before -- we made it . 
the boy done went into my walnuts ! i skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that 's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what i pick ! 
i bet you could use a hot cup of coffee nathan lee . 
and do n't wake up josie mae and earl ! 
is that a blessing reverend ? 
yeah he 'll crawl into my bed tonight lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley . 
it 's a shame reverend . it 's a damn shame . 
you got ta low - life job mister sheriff ! 
will they give him a trial ? 
i got to see my husband sheriff young ! 
you mean to tell me i ca n't see my own husband ? 
i do n't understand that sheriff young . 
i wanta see nathan . 
what is it ? ! 
right now it 's about 8 o'clock at home .   people are going to work kids are going to school ... 
in that case i accept . 
i would but no one can perform the ceremony .   i guess it does n't matter . 
marry you ? 
except write our wills . 
i never thought this would happen .   no premonitions nothing . 
so close ... 
we do n't have time .   i 'll explain later hurry ! 
we have room !   let 's go ! 
sooner than later . 
thanks for everything taylor . will i see you again ? 
so what 's going to happen to you ? 
i 'll do my best . 
how does the distress signal look ? 
i 'm about to blow the wall . 
taylor !   where are you ? 
you too . 
but you ca n't be sure !   it 's suicide .   you have to come with us ! 
but how are you going to escape ? 
and what are you going to do ? ! 
what ?   what are you talking about ? 
why ?   where are you going ? 
a flare ?   a flare wo n't do it . 
we do n't have enough suits to get the others out . 
what 's that ? 
oh my god .   what happened ? 
i guess i owe you a debt of gratitude .   you saved my life . 
words to live by . 
yeah but you did n't answer my question . 
what do you think 's going to happen to us ? 
do n't worry about me .   where are we going ? 
at this point i 'm ready for anything . 
yeah .   we did it . 
ready as i 'll ever be . 
i understand . 
look i know what i 'm doing . i have experience and training in space walking . 
even if we do it might be too late . 
it must be oxygenated if we can hear him . 
he certainly is polite . 
we could send mac .   if he can retrieve one suit we could go back for the other . 
suppose you did n't have to hold your breath ? 
why ca n't we ? 
sure . it complies with all standard construction codes . 
ok ... it 's open . 
ca n't we access the mainframe to check the ship 's condition ? 
supposing we could get out of this room ?   is there anything we could do to reach the bridge ? 
just considering our options ... sir . 
well maybe we can do something like that . 
given a malfunction how would a rescue team get you out if the doors wo n't open ? 
well maybe there 's a way out of here . 
what are we going to do ? 
still i hope i behave on the moon .   i 'll stick close to you . 
actually i 've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute mostly related to starship construction . 
well i hope i do n't do anything careless . 
like open an airlock by mistake ? 
so you were looking for a new challenge . 
yes .   theoretical discoveries aside there 's nothing like the real thing . how about you ? 
that 's right . 
yes mac but the guests are requesting it .   it will reduce the level of negative feedback . 
so i 've been told . 
no just enjoying the view . 
thank you . 
i 'm fine . 
i 'm going back for taylor ! 
he 's up on the bridge !   he 's going to be ok .   now who 's missing ? 
there 's no time to explain .   get everyone together !   we found a way to the pods ! 
oh a professional man . what 'll you have ? 
you look like you 're something on the lanes . 
buzz burger side of ' cues . you have n't introduced me to your fan . 
you do n't need coffee mr. fazeli ; you need a vacation . sheila catches sight of theo pulling into the parking lot . she puts a ken head earring in her right ear . buzz follows sheila 's gaze . 
junior who ? 
who 's there ? 
do you have to get your hooks into every guy i 'm interested in ? 
do n't go near the bowling alley . 
you still got the touch junior . 
leave him alone ! 
you 're using theo for your own deviant purposes ! 
that 's why mom ran away because you had to control everything ! 
after we eat dad . 
dad this is ridiculous . just open it . 
can you change something this big ? 
lips still for sale ? 
very professional . 
suck my dick ! 
i 'm not dumping you i 'm suspending you . 
your word is so good you 're never gon na give it to anyone . 
what about plan c ? 
i 'm pissing you off ? i 'm doing what i said i 'd do . what the hell are you doing ? what about your word ? 
who said anything about an ultimatum ? you want to find your father ? get a shovel and start digging . hurry up he 's probably in purgatory by now . sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from theo . he moves up beside her again . 
now he 's the one who 's locked up and i 'm the one who 's free . if i got ta do this alone i might as well start now . she revs up and peals out . 
i 've been trapped by miles kastle my whole life . she walks over to her scooter and mounts it . 
back to plan a. the vicious cycle all over again . theo lets go of sheila . 
theo buzz is dead . 
say something theo . give me something . a doll 's legs catch fire . theo stares into sheila 's eyes . 
you do n't get two chances with junior . 
if junior finds us he 'll kill us both . 
why did you come back ? 
can i come with you ? 
where are you going ? 
are you sure he 's dead ? 
i feel sick . 
if he 's not dead he 'll keep coming back . 
tell me what happened theo . 
did you - kill him ? 
we would have sooner or later . 
i told him you were my boyfriend . 
you do n't have to do this . we could just cut out of here go to akron   or anywhere else . 
these open the back door . do n't let him catch you behind the machines ; if he does you 're trapped . i 'll meet you at the bridge . theo takes the keys . sheila grabs his arm . 
i ca n't - i ca n't do it .   he 's my brother . 
i 'm afraid you 'll hurt him . 
i saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on tv . thunder rumbles . theo takes sheila by the shoulders . 
i ca n't tell you theo . 
no but something 's gon na blow in this town . i can feel it . 
you know how people with broken bones know when there 's a storm coming ? 
and besides it 's probably too late anyhow . 
yeah what did buzz fazeli ever do for you ? 
i 'm sure you would n't care if he needed your help right ? 
it would n't bother you if buzz was in danger would it ? 
... lane six . yes . 
you 're here . 
you professional men drive a hard bargain . i 'm afraid i only have five on me . sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill . 
come on bargain with me . 
how much would you charge me for the lips ? 
yeah but they 're all little wannabes . i 'm looking for a professional man . 
i 'm a credit card junkie . i went on a binge and my dad bailed me out . now i 'm trapped in his easy payment plan . 
my mom told me not to stay in this town . 
do you talk with your mom ? 
i do n't think your new outfit suits you theo . 
plan c ...   ... is me . 
come on theo what about plan c ? 
what ? be my body guard ?   here 's my body theo . guard it . for my dad 's sake . for your career . sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt . 
oh really ? nothing ? my dad does n't do anything unless there 's something in it for him . 
ha ! and what do you have to do for him ? 
what do you think my dad 's gon na do for you ? 
what 's plan b ? 
so you 're hoping buzz can get you re- instated ? 
why were you suspended ? 
i wanted to be a motocross champion . my folks did n't really care what i did . then junior blew a fuse and i became their last hope . most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats i got bowling . i never understood how anyone could take it so seriously . i hope i 'm not insulting you . 
theo what would you do if you could n't bowl ? 
we 'll get into that later . 
so what about you ? 
nobody in this town really understands junior . when i went to family sessions for him i realized he was the sanest one in the family . actually he 's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants . 
no . not at the present . 
do you have a boyfriend ? 
do you have a girlfriend ? 
can i ask you something personal ? 
you and your sideburns are the talk of the party theo . 
mind if i cut in ? 
it 's a vicious cycle . 
he follows me he tries to have sex with me and then they send him to the nut - hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me he tries to have sex with me they send him to the nut - hut for a while ... 
the mental hospital . 
everything has it 's drawbacks . 
when i 'm on my bike i feel like a wild person .   better than any sex i 've ever had . 
i think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do . 
your dad 's one of the only nice people in this fucking town . my dad is slime . kastle walks over . theo stands up and shakes kastle 's proffered hand . 
wo n't your father help you with that ? 
what do you want with my dad ? 
here theo it 's the fazeli specialty ; a seven - ten split . theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing . 
yeah babylon . buzz runs the lanes there for my dad . everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad . theo splits . 
mine and they never tip . 
coming right up . 
how do you want it ?   the eggs . 
whips ... orange whips . 
norman please !   do n't ! 
do n't do it ! 
norman do n't do it ! 
do n't pull it norman .   it 'll start a < u > fire</u > we ca n't stop .   norman ? 
do n't do it norman ! 
that 's our reserve air . 
what was that ? 
where is it ? 
what are you saying -- we ca n't stop what 's out there ? 
but you 've tested it ? 
high voltage ? 
what do we use for defense ? 
what if it attacks ? 
what was that ? 
nice work captain sir . 
i 'm not sure .   i 've never seen anything like it . 
but she 's -- 
forgive me .   i 've never read the navy manual .   i wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures . 
yeah .   i heard you . 
two and a half days ? 
how long will that be ? 
i am not leaving without him .   do you hear me ?   we come down as a team we leave as a team . 
not everything .   even on earth .   take ... yeasts . 
how about i just press the button ? 
any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up ? 
hold on -- 
would you wait a minute ? 
wait a minute -- 
there 's heat coming the door . 
in basic english what does all this mean ? 
how big is this spacecraft ? 
how 's that ? 
would it work ? 
get away -- 
get away from me ! 
you hear that ? 
what is that ?   what are you doing ? 
top shelf is it ? 
oh sure .   here .   anything else beth can get you ?   some more chicken perhaps .   let beth check the fridge . 
do n't tell me about me .   i already know too much . 
oh please do n't shrink me norman . not now . 
you ca n't stop it norman .   you ca n't fight me . 
leave me alone norman . 
it 's you norman .   your fear of drowning .   you have to face it . 
from you norman .   from your mind . you 're doing it . 
stop what ?   do n't blame me .   it 's not me . 
do n't you know ? 
you 're frightened are n't you norman ? 
i 'm not fucking with you norman . you 've fucked yourself . 
of course you 're going to deny it . you want to blame someone else .   you want to blame beth .   because you hate beth . 
this is what i 'm talking about norman .   do n't you see ?   it 's in you . this vindictiveness .   this rage . 
you think i care ?   you think i care if i die ?   would i put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically if i cared about myself ?   would i ? i 've tried twice before norman why would n't i try a third time ?   i 'm not thinking about myself -- no norman i 'm thinking about you .   your safety . protecting you from your own self . 
it 's your choice .   because it 's not safe for you to be awake .   to be walking around .   to be thinking about things . 
it 's either this ... or i kill you . 
you think i 'd belive you ?   believe anything you might say now ?   after you lied to me about telling barnes about my past .   about my problems .   my problems .   not yours .   not his .   mine . 
promise what norman ?   tell me ! 
but i have to norman . 
i 'm not scaring you am i norman ?   i hope i 'm not frightening you .   the last thing i want to do is frighten you .   you feel okay do n't you ? 
is it ? 
you do n't remember you did .   but i 'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get harry do n't you ?   you remember that . 
am i ?   or am i making so much sense that you 're going insane ? 
did i ?   or was that you ?   when you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened did n't you ?   terrified .   like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor .   you did that norman . 
one lonely terrifying sea snake . 
and the snakes ?   you want to know about the snakes ?   you saw one outside earlier did n't you ?   when you thought i had deserted you -- you were terrified . 
am i lying ?   are you sure ?   are you absolutely sure i 'm lying ?   then explain to me about the jellyfish .   earlier .   why did we see jellyfish ?   harry does n't fear jellyfish .   you do .   they 're your fear are n't they ? 
c'm on -- what ? 
yes someone did .   but it was n't me norman .   it was you .   you manifested the snakes . 
you think i manifested the snakes ? 
no he ca n't . 
no he is n't . 
same reason i put explosives around the habitat .   for defense .   for the power .   to protect myself . 
if i was then i would 've had to have gone in the sphere would n't i ? 
do n't you ? 
you tell me . 
am i afraid of them ?   not during the day .   sea snakes are diurnal .   when the sun 's out they do n't bite . fortunately for you i had on my watch .   this is quite good . 
snakes ?   what do you mean exactly ? 
i did do that did n't i ? 
you do n't think i put something in it do you ? 
it 's getting cold . 
are you ? 
what 's wrong norman ? 
oh yes my watch .   i almost forgot . 
what was that ?   i could n't hear you . 
how 's harry ? 
what do you mean different ? 
in the sub .   resetting the timer . why ? 
what is it norman ? 
you 're not sorry .   you 're scared .   you 're a psychologist norman .   you pride yourself on knowing when someone 's lying to you not telling you the truth .   and now you 're scared ... because you 're not sure you can tell anymore . 
for what ? 
only lab rats .   here . 
you ever given an injection before . 
look it 's either him or us norman . another attack and we go down with this place . 
to be on the safe side .   i mean -- 
it 's an idea . 
what if it takes 20 minutes norman ? what if it takes an hour ?   and he can fight it off ?   we ca n't afford that . 
how fast does it take effect ? 
i 'll just boost the doses . 
how long does it last ? 
causes sleep . 
it 's a soporific . 
how do you spell it ? 
antihistamine .   for bites . 
tranquilizer .   causes drowsiness . 
nothing about drowsiness . 
a synthetic opium analogue . 
it 's for motion sickness . 
something for burns . 
why would harry go back to using a code ? 
and that 's the part of harry that 's being manifested . 
his dream ?   you ca n't control your dreams .   and you ca n't control your fears can you ? 
but why is he doing it ? 
which i told barnes was attacking -- 
how can the sphere do that ? 
but how ? 
you think in the sphere -- 
what do you mean a part of harry ? 
damn it norman !   he 's lying .   do n't you get it ?   there is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he 's causing it .   why ca n't you believe me ? 
you think it 's me ?   you think i 'm saying there was a conversation when there was n't ? 
damn it norman .   i swear .   i had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up . 
you do n't believe me . 
no it was n't .   i swear none of this was here .   none of it .   you think he hid it ?   earlier .   he must 've hid it . 
none of this was here before . 
wait a second -- 
that was n't in there before . 
the refridgerator . 
fixing it ?   but i fixed --   where 'd you get all that ? 
what 's harry doing with your suit in there ? 
you get it straightened out ? 
deserts you ?   harry said he 'd take over for me . 
getting food .   we were out of food . what 's wrong ?   you sound mad . 
... what do you mean ?   i 'm in the ship . 
still clear . 
you ca n't .   counter 's at 10 minutes . you do n't have time . 
yes norman .   i did .   you 're just nervous . 
what 's the matter ? 
still clear . 
the sub 's a 100 feet in front of you .   you see it ? 
you press a button norman .   it 's not brain surgery .   here go ahead .   you only have 15 minutes to reset it .   go on norman ... 
you do n't trust me ? 
i fixed your suit . 
i do n't trust harry to do it . 
you should know how it works .   just in case . 
maybe you should go .   to the sub . 
get the helium out of our bloodstream .   we go to the surface now we 'd pop like a soda bottle . 
we ca n't .   the storm .   the waves would toss us around worse than we got down here .   and we have four days of decompression when we get up top . 
you me and harry .   he 's asleep . 
it 's also our only way out of here ! it holds three people .   and there 's only three of us left now . 
do n't bother me norman . 
i have to reset the sub . 
no i should stay calm .   like you say .   right norman ?   stay calm . 
yeah okay .   sure norman . 
you bastard . 
you did did n't you ? 
you told him about me ? 
you said something to him did n't you ? 
do n't tell me to calm down ! 
he 's not just a navy captain -- he works for the fucking pentagon . 
in edmunds ' things . 
fuck you norman !   it 's right here ... 
so who was barnes talking to at the last minute ?   nobody . 
yeah he < u > told</u > you .   think .   what was barnes doing before they cut that cable loose ?   he was on the phone . except that cable is a thousand feet long norman .   they would 've broken off communication with us four five minutes before they cleared out . 
... he lied to us .   he left us down here . 
she was crushed .   feel her skin -- it 's like sandpaper . 
i did n't do anything wrong .   i did n't mean ... 
nobody said ... norman ...   what ?   why are you looking at me like that ? 
what ? ...   wait .   do n't ... why are you -- 
i mean i 'm not ... i was n't absolutely sure if ... they -- 
what ?   why ... 
yeah why ? 
they have six tentacles .   a new species .   and the squid too .   they had no stomach . 
normally i 'd say no .   everything 's quiet now -- no ships no divers no electricity .   makes sense .   but what 's curious is -- these are n't normal jellyfish . 
what about you ?   what happened to you ? 
my gosh norman . 
a bad one .   it was the only book in there .   norman come here look at this . 
the library . 
it could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas . 
good theory ted . 
such a gentlemen when you 're scared shitless . 
you 're next norman . 
is n't there a psychological term for that dr. johnson ? 
just keep your mouth shut alright ? this could mean everything to our careers you know that ?   do n't jeopardize this . 
well let 's pray that 's the only mistake you made .   have you said anything to barnes about this ? 
well you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here .   in the ocean .   70 percent of the earth 's surface is water norman .   that 's first grade geography . 
what do you expect ?   for them to bring it up here ? 
to the spacecraft .   to investigate . 
because when we get down there -- 
do yourself a favor norman .   are you listening ?   do n't tell anyone what you just told me . 
that 's quite a secret . 
i 've read it twice norman .   it 's brilliant . 
i love secrets . 
who says it 's a he ? 
norman ?   where 's norman ? 
i 'm a woman .   i do n't theorize .   i only deal with facts . 
i do n't get it . 
well think .   because there 's footprints here that are n't mine . 
what 's that -- mistake number two norman ? 
we can refuse to talk . 
no i 'm not .   i 'm not star-- 
like what ?   i 'm not -- 
our habitat i mean .   this place ca n't handle another attack . 
just in time too . 
i 'm sorry .   slip of the tongue . 
jerry .   right .   i said jerry did n't i ? 
harry ?   that 's bullshit .   we stood right there -- 
yes you did .   norman i would n't leave you out there .   you know that . 
when he woke up he said we were out of food .   he told me to get some from the ship . 
take politics our views on abortion the death penalty ... 
what are you looking for ? 
then what is it ? 
it 's empty .   why would someone build a ship like this ? 
for whoever 's in that thing . 
all that banging and pounding .   i do n't know .   we should think about making a good first impression . 
zander no ... ! 
zander what are you doing ? 
is it true ? 
i thought i was dead . lucky for me you jokers showed up eh ? 
i do n't know zander . 
a funeral . 
no i ... oh zander i 'm a fool . 
please i ... everybody 's lost someone by now . this should n't be any different ... 
excuse me ... !

i ca n't hear you . 
we make mistakes .   and we forgive each other .   because we love each other very m ... 
i know how scared < u > i</u > get when < u > you're</u > sick .   so i waited to tell you .   until it was getting smaller . i thought that was best maybe i was wr ... 
secret 's safe with me . 
i bet . 
like a big sister . 
i hope it 's the right kind . 
well .   it 's for you . 
that happens .   to families . 
like seeing the good side of rachel . so she 'll see the good side of us . 
but we do have a choice .   to make it better .   instead of worse . 
daddy and i tried hard .   we really did . 
look she 's upset -- 
well daddy and i are just friends now and that 's no reason not to wear mascara ... 
i 'm a little tired and it 's just a pick - me - up .

daddy was washing rachel .   in the shower .   what did you think that was about ? 
lord nelson napoleon 's troops .   i fear for the women and the property values . 
annabelle daddy and i will always be there . that 's one time always is always .   you can call him after dinner but ... 
that will never happen . 
it happens . 
well he 's not president anymore so why be petty . 
look if the truth is you do n't feel like talking about this right now that 's fine . but do n't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me . cause there are only so many lies you 're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face .   you wind up looking like ... 
maybe you 're upset that rachel moved in . 
well you 're telling your teachers and your friends -- 
well daddy and i were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen . 
excellent point . 
thank you .   those were all words .   i hate the planet uranus .   < u > terrible</u > name for a planet . 
< u > never</u > say ' never ' -- it 's < u > not</u > fair to say ' always ' -- and < u > no</u > name calling . use your words . 
i know you do n't but if you had chrom- atically you < u > are</u > in the purple family .

you 'll be up to your armpits in meatballs i 'm flying them in from sweden . 
honey this is thursday .   i pick you up tomorrow and we do < u > big</u > spaghetti . 
what honey ? 
yes ... if you like big hair ... 
people like rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money . 
ben mommies work too .   they work very hard .   mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working .   i just do n't get paid . 
no that 's your fault .   it 's her fault for not watching over my precious son as if it were her priority .   which means the most important job . 
ben !   oh my ben !   are you alright ? 
thank you ben .   annabelle ! 
seven of clubs .   nobody 's mad we just want to talk about it . 
lava 's hateable .   i never thought of that . 
i hate snails and blue cheese . especially together .   < u > hate</u > . 
i noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps rachel 's underpants are in there -- now where are your lunches ? 
why would his worry ?   or my children 's worry .   or anyone 's worry .   help the sit ... 
i have to get dressed .   my ex - husband has asked me to dinner .   god knows why he was very mysteri ... 
that 's necessary huh ? 
so we'll ... radiate some more ? 
people beat it do n't they ?   all the time . 
i had a lot of treatments and they were n't any fun but the tests show the cancer got smaller . 
i live or i die . 
walk in the park .   and thanks for the ' we ' . 
i know .   i would n't know what to say .   if it were you . 
yeh better i should forcefeed him burnt lamb and ... couscous was it she made him ?   boy kids go wild for that . 
never stand between that kid and a meatball . 
it 's temporary . 
stop .   you 're making me insecure . 
and we all went through that together ? 
the great thing about life is that things keep changing . 
no .   you think this is going to help the kids then you do it .   you 're on your own . 
we are over . 
you ca n't be an ' us ' just when you want to .   you ca n't play that card when it 's convenient . 
to make it easier for them or you ? 
just not to me . 
tell me exactly how you 're different from three years ago ?   the music sounds kind of the same from where i 'm sitting . 
annabelle showed me the new dress . she 's amazing in it . 
and i 'm supposed to care . 
< u > slugs</u > .   have faster learning curves . < u > trees</u > even . 
you 're saying do n't make the kids a football do n't put them through a war .   but i 'm doing this for < u > their</u > well - being . 
called him .   we set an ap ... 
we 've broken a lot of promises have n't we luke ? 
i 'm not gon na wait around to see the next one .   i 'm not gon na watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement .   i 'm seeing a lawyer . 
not to me . 
do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today ?   how lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did ?   he could have been ... 
... until the plan changed when jessie 's mom gave us these tickets . what rachel . ' forgot ' i told her ? 
at the big apple circus it 's the only big top i know .   i < u > said</u > i 'd get 'em back tonight ... 
just outside the big top we 're almo ... 
easy enough . 
luke i need to switch next friday for thursday so why do n't you take the weekend ...   ... that way you 'll be there and i 'll pick up monday tuesday and wednesday . 
i 'm worried . 
you tried that last week and we were on hold forty - five minutes ... 
it 's wednesday night .   she 's at my house .   i 'll talk to her . 
except for last thursday when rachel forgot to pick them up -- 
they want to be with you luke they go to your house to be with their father . 
we 're not discussing your age . 
since our divorce luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids he 's now living with a woman half his age -- 
something 's up wi ... 
because you do n't really seem here . 
are you here ? 
remarried .   there is no move . 
just sit me up .   nice and tall . bring benjamin first . 
just want to be a little sharper . for a few minutes . 
i have their past . 
you 'll learn . 
you 're the hip and fresh . 
what do i have that you do n't ? 
why did n't i ? 
he only remembers i < u > found</u > him .   my point is telling you this story would have been the kindest most helpful thing i could ever have done for you . 
i was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off .   doing my imitation of you . 
i lost him .   i was panicked . 
come on a wuss like me ?   the stiff who would n't help her own daughter fight back ? 
is scary .   but you want it .   gimme some truth here . 
no there is n't . 
what 's this about ?   because we < u > fought</u > ? 
she likes a stolie no ice . 
thanks for coming out . 
you 've turned her into you .   and i may not get another chance .   to turn her back . 
and there will come < u > another</u > moment . when the stakes are < u > really</u > there . and she will look back on this .   and remember how good it felt .   how easy it was . 
well that 's what parenting is < u > about</u > little girl .   they are < u > pleading</u > to know how they are supposed to do it . and you sure as hell < u > showed</u > her . 
doing the < u > right</u > thing .   knowing who you < u > are</u > inside .   not < u > caving</u > to peer pressure or < u > lowering</u > yourself to that level < u > steering</u > your < u > own</u > course ... 
shut the fuck up .   < u > i</u > did n't go behind < u > your</u > back . 
see in that crisis i saw an opportunity .   for some < u > real</u > growth . 
well maybe < u > your</u > version of growing up is ' just win baby ' . 
you think < u > i</u > did n't have some dirty words for that little putz ?   you think < u > i</u > could n't figure out some low blows ? 
you taught my child that i am some limp dick < u > loser</u > .   who did n't < u > care</u > about her pain . 
so you became the hero .   and i became the schmuck . 
you had her < u > lie</u > about that ... that fancy - boy < u > model</u > ! 
you put filth in my child 's mouth . 
you are < u > defending</u > what you did ? 
actually .   they 'll want annabelle 's mother . 
because there 'll be oh 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so .   and they 'll b ... 
now ' limp dick ' i know .   what . is ' snowballing ' ? 
and i 'm going to win . 
now we 're going to have a fight you and i. 
he looks familiar .   did he do a calvin klein ad ? 
who in the world < u > is</u > he ? 
is that what he told you ? 
took 28 hours .   she just was n't sure about entering this world . 
somehow his blanket always looked like a cape even the nurse said that .   he < u > loves</u > to hear that story over and over .   how he was born a magician . 
feeling the pressure ? 
that 's motherhood .   that 's the job with or without a career . i 'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness . they < u > need</u > you to be happy . 
i know you huh ?   the car pools he measles the pta .   it 's not gon na be enough for you in the long run .   you have to think long term . 
yes .   i made the choice that was right for me .   and i do n't regret it .   but even for me there were days when i felt so lost so invis- ible .   and then i 'd hate myself for the kids not being enough . 
juggle it !   move the darkroom into your house .   you 've got that room downstairs with the treadmill luke never uses anyway .   do n't lose your confidence .   do n't lose your edge . 
you mean after i 'm dead ? 
do what you 've worked your whole life to do ? 
i 'm thinking .   do i know you well enough to really chew you out ? 
... go to the park .   in the worst way . 
it 's < u > covered</u > okay ?   i appreciate your concern .   can i talk to her ? 
thanks but it 's under control . 
how 's she doing with brad ? 
eat your heart out .   is annabelle there ? 
what else ?   keep on keepin ' on . 
he 's relentless .   a < u > major</u > asshole . 
the primo stuff is great for pain . 
you try to center on the big issues y'know .   what it 's all about .   what this whole trip has meant .   but then the < u > really</u > big issues keep swamping y ... 
yeh that 's bull .   i 'm going for serene they say some actually get there . 
i really look like shit . 
it 's promising this one .   we 're upbeat . 
it 's a mess right now .   that 's my project when i get back . 
and you said ... ? 
she 's devastated . 
oh my god . 
... going out yeh .   i had kids of my own once . 
she has n't mentioned this . 
you 're a cross - dresser . 
small world . 
ironic huh ? 
i have given them more < u > love</u > and more < u > care</u > every fifteen < u > minutes</u > of their lives than you could manage in the next fifty < u > years</u > ! 
they came out of my < u > body</u > ! 
you are < u > marrying</u > the < u > greatest</u > guy who walks this < u > earth</u > .   who i have < u > loved</u > from my < u > heart</u > for twelve < u > years</u > ! 
how would you know < u > anything</u > ? 
how the hell would you know ? 
life 's a trade - off .   you get cancer your hair falls out but you < u > do</u > get to smoke dope . 
really .   by what right ?   six months of part - time screw - ups ? 
then let him talks to me .   we do n't need you to solve our prob ... 
did i hear the word ... 
bi - coastal parenting .   happens every day .   luke gets the kids every other summer every other holiday it 's not ideal but people make it work and ... 
nobody likes a snoop . 
do n't flatter yourself . 
you what ? 
my boss . 
i do n't know wh ... 
let's ... hold up for a bit .   it may not happen .   our secret okay ? 
... make some trips into the city . sometimes overnight . 
... thinking of going back to random house .   on a part - time basis . 
not great .   plus i 've got things on my mind .   you know . 
she was angry at herself . 
hey .   at least it 's not an editing machine . 
it 's okay it 's twenty minutes .   the horse'll be there . 
do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can i finish ? 
ben likes to be read to .   do you know dr. seuss ... ? 
bandaids for cuts .   bandaids for new shoe blisters .   packet of wash n dri 's . kleenex .   sugar free lollipops potty seat covers for public restrooms ... 
fine forget it . 
however many .   it 's not enough . 
i have an appointment this after- noon .   i need someone to take them to the park . 
so why did y ... 
those are < u > my</u > children you 're practicing on .   they deserve < u > first-</u > rate care .   every minute .   of every night .   and every day . 
you 're not terribly good at taking care of h ... 
i did n't need you to take the blame for me i 'm quite ... 
i 'm sorry .   look i 'm not real comfortable being here but ... 
a court < u > order</u > is gon na say that < u > woman</u > is < u > never</u > < u > alone</u > with my children !   ever < u > again</u > !   do you hear that ? 
i am not < u > here</u > to make it easier for you .   these are < u > my</u > children .   they do n't want to < u > be</u > with you . 
you listen carefully because i am only going to say this once .   that woman has nothing more to do with my children . 
annabelle does n't really want to talk to you right now . 
think twice .   before you < u > ever</u > pull that again . 
of all the < u > cheap</u > excuses .   to break a child 's heart . 
machines do not eat message . 
you got to hell ! 
get out ! 
oh and i do n't because i have a children ? ! the problem is you 're too self - involved to ever be a mother . 
you mean for you .   a 10 - year - old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family .   she sees her father naked with another woman for the first time . and you think it 's best for her if every- one pretends it did n't happen ?   this is n't going to work out . 
did you or luke talk to her about it afterwards ? 
i 'm sure that did n't upset her . everyone in our family takes showers . 
... a ridiculously < u > expensive</u > and < u > inappropriate</u > item which her father and i have already < u > told</u > her she is < u > far</u > too young to own .   but < u > you</u > apparently want to < u > buy</u > her forgiveness with ... 
what did you do ? 
what happened with annabelle ?   has nothing i said gotten through to you ? 
annabelle how 's your video rep ... 
we do n't have any coffee . 
every tuesday except the 3rd tuesday of the month when it 's switched to friday except in april when she rides on thursday .   it 's not that hard .   did n't you have a mother ? 
how do you hold down a job ?   it 's 8:10 . you were supposed to be here at 7:00 . she 's missed her sunrise groom'n ride . 
a < u > suitable</u > boy will be at < u > this</u > flagpole < u > on</u > monday with a < u > very</u > expensive bike and he will be a stone fox if i have to call an < u > escort</u > service ! 
the guy < u > i</u > see is in the eighth grade at < u > prep</u > school and he laughs his < u > ass</u > off every time we talk about you . 
he 'll be impressed .   the clincher is you < u > walk</u > away then < u > whip</u > around ... 
oh .   it 's an incredibly disgusting and not remotely sexy thing that they described in a movie i 'd never let you go to .   but it 's real .   does he have an older brother ? 
great .   big ears too ? 
help me here ... 
no baby .   you 're gon na use < u > my</u > words . 
and you < u > don't</u > tell her .   what you 're going to say . 
that 's because your mother is a fine person finer than i will ever be .   now just this once ... 
now is that little prick still here because if he is i 'm gon na rip his fucking < u > heart</u > out ! 
... laughed yeh .   they laughed real hard . 
oh baby i 'm so sor ... 
june 3rd god willing i 'll marry your dad .   and then i < u > will</u > be your stepmom . and right now i 'm not looking forward to th ... 
no .   i think it 's ugly . 
you think this is funny ? 
that does n't bother me . 
annabelle pick up the phone . 
annabelle i know you miss your mother .   so why do n't you say hello . 
honey she wo n't d ... 
that 's so weak . 
she still packing for her trip ?

hold lunch ! 
the timing was off -- i need this light . 
this is my house too ! 
what i meant and perhaps i did n't say it well was you have a great mom .   you do n't need another one .   but when you 're at this house -- 
thank god for that ! 
i 'm sorry okay ?   let 's not fi ...

of course not .   does he look lost to you ?   bennnnn ! ! ! 
i did n't forget .   i was up all night thinking about it and i concluded you 're too special to look like everyone else .   orange red .   that 's your color .   few can carry it off .   now please .   help me find your brother . 
it 's your girlfriend big guy open up . 
' in the still ... still of the ni - ight ... i held you ... held you so ti - ight' ... take it man ...

& quot;goodnight moon goodnight hush goodnight mush goodnight goodnight goodnight gracie -- goodnight ben ! 
mmmm !   tasty .   you 're a master chef ben . just like your dad . 
& quot;in the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon ... &quot ;

annabelle let 's get something clear . 
... eggzactly .   i 'm putting on my coat --   we are late .   we are seriously late .   which means mister ben we 've got to get you dressed -- 
hello? ... duncan ... the ad agency 's already there? ... i'm out the door ...   ben !   knock it off !   it 's gon na go beautifully ...   damn it ben --

oh my god .   that is so not funny .   you 're late .   you 're really late .   now get out here and have some cereal . 
sure .   i was just doin' my nails . 
and when did that pass ? 
you say that like i do n't know that . 
cooper back the fill off i do n't have enough shadow ... 
no no no this is a job that 's hard to < u > keep</u > < u > not</u > a job that 's hard to < u > lose</u > ca n't be both . 
duncan .   i 've got an < u > even</u > < u > better</u > idea ... 
they 're losing one mother .   they ca n't lose two . 
which part of no do n't you understand ? 
i 've got it .   it 's in the can cooper can wrap th ...

duncan .   my work is everything to me . this 'll never happen again .   now stand back -- this session 's gon na make you remember why you hired me even though i would n't sleep with you -- cooper let 's get these penguins dancing -- 
you know there 's nothing you have to say .   because they know your heart .   you do n't have t ... 
now edna says you short - changed your last meds .   you can do presents and be comfortable at the same time y'know . 
you know every story every wound every memory their whole life 's < u > happiness</u > has been wrapped up in < u > you</u > every moment ... 
you ride with annabelle ... 
everything .   you're ... the earth mother incarnate ... 
with good reason .   they fucking worship you as it is . 
uh .   you hate my guts ? 
ben never mentioned it . 
you are lying you never lost that kid for 4 < u > seconds</u > you could find him from a < u > coma</u > there is no way ! 
you 're lying . 
maybe i was wrong on that one . 
well it 's the jack kennedy syndrome huh ?   you die young you always look golden .   perfect .   the memory kind of burnishes the image and ... 
i never wanted to be a mom .   then sharing it with you was one thing . carrying it alone the rest of my life ... 
and i have looked down the road . at what my life will be .   and i ca n't handle it . 
i love luke i love the children . but there is more to life than even love ... 
do n't flatter yourself .   i always liked that line . 
neutral ground .   what 's up ? 
< u > that's</u > what it is .   and that 's < u > all</u > it is . 
and she 'll fight back again .   god help me what have i done . 
she was n't steering her own course she was steering < u > yours</u > . 
oh please . 
you were n't passing 'em out . 
that 's not wh ... 
she was beaten and bloodied and it was going to go on uni ... 
worked .   like a charm . 
right down to the ground .   let 's get to it . 
is that what you 're worried about ? looking bad at the pta ? 
give 'em my number . 
it does n't matter i did n't tell h ... 
do n't be too sure . 
are we . 
looks nice enough to m ... 
you really did n't have to come you know .   i 'd have brought them straight t ... 
he wo n't discuss it .   just calls it history . 
that thing you said before .   pushing the guy sleeping next to you away . because of what you gave up for motherhood ... 
and her ... ? 
my advice to you ?   do n't die . 
i just want to spend time with them when i 'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or ... 
it 's the same choice you made . 
hey you have n't quit on you i 'm sure as hell not gon na .   i just mean i 'm juggling a lot right n ... 
it was just a job there 'll be plenty of others . 
it 's just not the right time t ...

yeh she's ... i'll get you ben first it 's past his bedti ... 
and you said ... 
i think my ' primo shit ' got left in my ' bellbottoms . ' 
brad kovitsky . 
you look sick .   but you look ... together .   mentally tough . 
so .   hopeful . 
can i look at the pictures ? 
beats me .   ask your mom . 
does n't < u > begin</u > to describe it . i mean you 've got cancer < u > this</u > is serious . 
right .   which is the whole < u > point</u > of this ' going out ' thing so one of them can dump the other one and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy without ever having to actually date . 
anyway .   he walks up to her on lunch yard today .   and tells her ... publicly ... that they 're ' breaking up . ' 
as you may know ' going out ' in the six grade does n't mean shit .   they do n't actually < u > go</u > to a movie or anywhere they do n't even eat lunch together it 's just a declaration to the world that they 're ... 
toi .   they 've been ' going out ' for two weeks . 
she was afraid you 'd make a big deal out of it . 
that .   and .   annabelle is over her head .   with brad ' the dreamboat ' kovitsky . 
so i have to tell you something in confidence ... 
luke 's depo ran late .   i promised i 'd take notes . 
okay i 'm undeserving . 
see i know that . 
and cigarettes .   i smoke too . 
i do n't but ... 
you bet you are . 
you 're not dying . 
i got used to ... thinking of them . as ... my kids too . 
... it 's my problem too . 
luke .   ca n't live like that . 
we ca n't live like that . 
but i came here to ... 
and i know checking into your life was inexcusable ... 
look you 've never liked me ... 
you 're taking the kids .   and moving to san francisco . 
you 're not working at random house i talked to them . 
i was looking for annabelle 's book and i found your tickets .   and the note .   from your new boss . 
uh .   have you told luke and the ki ... 
hey any help you need we 'll cover . 
wowie .   how wonderful ! 
you feeling all right ? 
when i twisted hair like this it means i 'm intimidated by you ... 
last week when she chopped her barbie 's bangs all to hell -- 
what about obsessively picking her split ends ? 
no way .   i told her two three years maybe for such an expens ... 
i 'm sorry i just ... 
sorry i 'm late i got lost dropping ben off at kevin 's . 
not personally . 
why not just bring the whole toilet ? 
i 'm already on thin ice .   yesterday i actually thought my boss was going to fire me . 
what ?   and have federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders ? how many years do you get in this state for giving second - rate care to minors ? 
i did it for her . 
i need practice . 
she already hates me .   you 've seen to that . 
i did n't do it for you .   believe me . 
i have a snoop . 
i do n't recall inviting you . 
... in . 
well maybe they would if they thought it was okay with y ... 
jackie if i thought for one moment ... 
i 'm sorry i did n't mean to break your concentration .   i thought it would be a nice moment to rememb ... 
look i ... 
but it 's not on the schedule ! 
maybe the problem is your < u > kids</u > .   maybe they 're spoiled coddled < u > brats</u > ! 
you 're damn right .   i 'm gon na sick of your imperious bullshit .   i never said i was betty fucking crocker .   if every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third friday or the month -- go ahead !   i have a life ! 
no .   i thought it might be uncomfortable for her -- 
i was in there in him . 
luke was in the shower this morning and annabelle sort of walked in without knocking . 
< u > forgiveness?</u >   for < u > what</u > exactly ? 
she 's been talking about this little editing machine it 's only ... 
nothing .   look i want to talk to you about ... well ... luke said to ask you ... 
maybe you could back off just a little bit -- 
what is this ?   the betty ford center ? 
can i please have a cup of coffee ? 
this is friday her riding lesson is on tuesdays .   i got it right here ... 
i 'm gon na get me a drink . 
how about the promises we make to our kids ?   about < u > their</u > future .   do we shrug those off just that easily ? 
because you 've changed so much . 
' but keep dancing and if you 're lucky i might just never leave who knows ? ' 
no here 's ugly .   ' i love < u > you</u > babe . it 's just our < u > life</u > together i 'm not so sure about ... ' 
no she threw you out .   what a difficult woman . 
excuse me .   ' things are so confusing for me jack .   our life feels too comfortable too safe too predict- able .   it 's a partnership it 's juggling schedules .   when i think of playing that out every day for the rest of my life ... ' 
by way of saying you were unhappy . 
let me put it this way .   hell no . 
what do you call it ?   you told her you had doubts . 
... while she watched the kids .   then you booked this flat in paris for your family 's summer .   but she said ... 
you took a fishing trip with the boys . liked it so much you took another . 
imagine my relief .   so what 's for dinner ? 
just like to make sure .   that your past .   and my future .   are real different . 
hold your applause .   we 're not having fun here . 
no problem . 
i know that . 
great wallow in guilt you < u > sure</u > you 're not jewish ? 
are you hungry ?   you could make us something ? 
it 's just an assignment . 
it 's no biggie . 
what 's eight ten years ?   hell you 'll still be ambulatory .   i think . 
everything 's gon na work out .   the kids and i ... we're going to love each other . 
okay ... is that the good thing or the bad thing ? 
i think so too ... 
oh my god .   are you serious ? 
you have n't done < u > one</u > goddam thing to make any of this easier ... 
why are you taking this out on < u > him</u > ? 
our weekend .   at that sweet little b & amp ; b. 
hey i sold my body to satan to clear friday at two o'clo ... 
uh .   annabelle 's video report has been switched again . 
you know i do n't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot ... your ex - wife 's doing a bang up job and i have to face it every tuesday and thursday and every other goddamn weekend and i just do n't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long !   jesus what did you see in her ?   i do n't get it -- i just do n't get it . 
oh right ... so it 's just complicated for you and jackie -- for me it 's pretty simple cause i just do n't understand ... 
really ?   look in your ex - wife 's eyes . 
and what you 're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work -- 
look .   i know they hate me . 
i know how responsible caring adults parent children .   i 'm bribe 'em .   but 'em a dog or something .   maybe a doberman . 
but ?   but what ? 
you do n't trust me to be alone with them . 
ca n't handle them myself is what you mean .   ca n't . 
i can take them to work with me -- i can shift things around -- 
for what ? 
so i 'll have to order in ? 
you 'd rather spoil our walk home . 
uh - oh .   i mention marriage all of a sudden ...   ve < u > haff</u > to ta ... 
the way you cook .   if you could make love i 'd marry you . 
well it was n't a reduction like you do it !   boiling down half a ton of bones ... 
okay if they 're going to < u > have</u > a sauce put something < u > in</u > it besides flour and chicken broth ... 
something came up .   c'm on ben ! i 've got a shoot at three ... 
no .   i 'm doing it behind her back . 
hi i 'm here to pick up ben . 
well then when you get older you can do something about it . 
it is when you love someone and they do n't love you . and then you do something about it . 
for rape and murder . 
i know ! 
i am sure . 
he was n't . 
jesus was not bad . 
poison gas . 
he was executed . he was on death row and then he was executed . 
he 's dead . 
my grandchild - baby . 
my baby . 
my jesus  
mi jesus esta muerto ! 
mi jesus  mi jesus  
this is work . 
i 'm always working . 
no mikey . 
i 'm still poor . 
we had to work . my family was poor . 
i did not go to high school . 
it was god 's will . 
four brothers and five sisters . 
yes mikey ? 
what 's an audience going to tell you ? 
we 're not ready ! 
we 're not ready . 
i dunno toby . we really have a long way to go . you still need a lot more footage and it 's probably a little premature to start screening  
i mean why are you making this documentary if you ca n't treat your subject with appropriate gravity ? 
you 've got a family tragedy on your hands . will you tell me what 's funny about that ? about a kid in a coma ? 
i mean without this footage without this rigorous documentation it would feel like exploitation . 
this is entertainment you 're making toby . this story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has with this brady crisis evolved into something much richer and more provocative . 
this is definitely better . 
the camerawork 's nice . 
no you do n't . 
you 're showing how superior you are to your subject . toby no but i like my subject . i like these people . 
well i 'm not really sure what you 're trying to say . it 's funny i suppose . but it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are . 
i admit it - i was scared ! i was shocked in fact   by what he said . and he 's so ... convincing . i 'm sorry if i let you down but really i still say he 's just one opinion . i do n't even like his books that much . they 're all so aggressively confrontational . i do n't care if he 's won the pulitzer prize . 
that 's not fair ! i was honest ! just because i was n't sucking up like that bitch catherine . 
marcus ... you'll write something better next time ! 
you know he hated my story also . 
do n't be so upset . it 's ok ... 
i was never much of a sweater . you know that . 
marcus i 'm tired . that 's all . 
you 'll read it in class tomorrow . surprise me .   anyway i have to go . i promised melinda i 'd help her with her oral . 
i think you should leave it the way it was . it was good . 
well then maybe you should just read the ending . 
oh . what happens now ? 
you mean again ? 
nigger fuck me hard ! ! ! ... 
nigger fuck me hard ! ! ... 
nigger fuck me hard ! 
fuck me hard ! 
... gger . 
oh bu ... uh ... i ca n't say that . 
it 's a really nice place you have . is the rent high ? 
thank you for being honest . 
oh .   do you think i have a potential as a writer ? 
are n't you going out with catherine ?   i 'm sorry . it 's none of my business . i did n't mean ... 
thank you .   so catherine seems like she might become a really good writer . 
and i also agreed with what you said today about marcus 's story . it is a piece of shit . 
good .   'cause i ... um ... i really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was ... 
can i join you ? 
yeah um then ... are you alone ? 
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean i just did n't expect to run into you here that 's all . 
what are you doing here ? 
ok . bye . 
listen toby i ca n't really talk right now . do you mind if i call you back ? 
eight six and four . 
yeah . but not any more . 
that 's good . 
i do . 
yeah . you did n't wanna take me to the prom . 
oh ? anything i might have seen ? 
that 's good . so then what do you do now ? 
that 's too bad . 
anything i might know about ? 
oh that 's too bad . 
i believe it . 
oh . so what did you do after you gave up on acting ? 
um well yeah .   so are you still acting ? 
but ... you called . 
so what 's going on ? 
toby - ? oh hi ! how are you ? 
who is this ? 
mm - hm . 
yeah i guess . 
well sure he 's rich and he 's famous . he 's got everything and you 've got nothing . 
it was like hell with windows . you know there 's shit on the walls . kids my age sucking their thumbs . i mean every day i would i 'd wake up in my cell and i 'd think my parents put me here . why ? why ? because i stayed out all night one time . uh because i broke the vcr when i was drunk . because i was out of control . i thought my parents loved me . 
yeah it would suck big time . i 'd kill myself first . 
no . oh maybe . fuck .

you just became a statistic ! 
what ? !   that 's insane ! ! !   why would i go to the police ? 
-- we practice !   sorry cleo . 
okay even with all our savings it 's still only six hundred fifty - four . 
but we have to make a smart plan ! 
... i do n't know .   probably not . 
and they get caught ! 
oh g - d i 'm sorry ... you 're not really fat !   i was just saying that because uh i thought that 's what you wanted me to say . 
look you 're fat diane .   you 're fat fat fat !   because you eat eat eat !   what ? !   she keeps asking because she wants some honesty . 
oh my g - d you 've been robbed ! 
diane ?   diane ! 
i want to help .   i 'm part of this squad ... 
stop it !   this is crazy ! 
... and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm ! 
diane it says here you 're going to have mood swings uncontrollable gas . 
thanks cleo .   see you tomorrow . 
my fault - what do we do that enables us to be as great as we are ? 
hee - hee - haaaa - weee worked it out .   heee hee - haaa .... 
it 's off ... i ca n't take the fighting the back - stabbing the open hostility . we 're not acting like cheerleaders we 're acting like a bunch of sorority girls ! 
cleo i 've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie ? 
everything 's fine .   i 'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down . 
wayne gretzky . 
i 've got to get that .   relax .   i 'll see you tomorrow . 
she thinks you went to the police . 
that 's right .   practice makes perfect . i 'm practicing to have a baby right now . if we do a practice job we 'll not only get the experience but also the extra money we need for guns ! 
hee - hee - hee haaaaa - that 's it ?   hee - hee hee ... 
of course - of course !   hands in ... 
so then this is n't crazy .   it 's a sure bet . 
if you do n't - can you still afford to go to harvard ? 
that 's right .   so all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes . 
c'm on luce people do it in the movies all the time . 
you sure ? 
no i do n't ... i keep asking because i feel fat . 
no ... i've been pregnant . 
huh - ha - wha ?   ahh !   i 'm under the ice !   i 'm uh -- oh ... man ...   that was a weird one . 
jus some girlie things for the squad . 
that was gas sweetie . 
uh jack - look i can explain ... 
if you reach for the stars you 're bound to get -- mm - jack pull over . 
mmm - hmmm ... 
i know but that was before . 
jack i think i should get a job . 
jack sweetie i 'm only eating for two . 
oh jack ... 
i sure do . 
i see a flower .   and y'know even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt . 
well if i had to guess ...   i 'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good - bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who 's going to be a daddy of his own ...   jack do you know what i see here ? 
hi jack . 
... do not accept charity .   we are two young able - bodied americans .   we do not want a handout .   we want a hand - up . give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow .   give us corn - the kind you plant not eat - and we 'll grow our own food and ... and uh then cut it and - uh y'know eat it !   now if you 're interested in giving us a home loan i will sit back down .   if not have a nice day ma'am . 
no .   wait !   did i say promise !   cross - my heart and hope - to - die stick - a - needle - in my - eye we 'll never miss a payment ? ! 
what ? !   but all our paperwork 's there . my school records jack 's football records ... 
do n't use big bills ! 
yeah hold on . 
remember kansas every time you point a finger you 've got three more pointing back at you . 
oh no ... 
hee - hee - h - wait a minute .   hold on now . what do we do before a big game ? 
no !   wait ... um ...   we 're the a - squad from lincoln high ? so uh ... 
oh thank g - d !   i 'm not just super fat ! 
it 's all my fault .   i 'm sorry i ever started this ... 
lucy do you know for sure you 're going to get that scholarship ? 
and if the o.j. trial taught us anything it taught us that in america you can cut off someone 's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money .   your mom only shot a guy ... 
listen kansas i know you dream of springing your mom some day ... 
you sure i 'm not fat ? 
he is the great one ... 
well i want to know what happened -- 
ooops that 's me -- got ta run ! 
no .   this is diane .   i think you have the wrong number . 
you 're kidding . 
hey hey hey .   c'm on you guys .   obviously that 's a little more than our budget will allow .   basically we 're looking for something around two - hundred dollars . 
bullets ?   no bullets !   oh my gosh these are just to scare people . kinda like round - off back handspring whip back double full .   you never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you 've got it . 
well we 'll each probably want one - so let 's make it five .   five should do it . 
i guess there 's an exception to every rule . 
hold on ... 
ooops hold on a sec . 
hannah we 've ... 
that 's okay hannah .   it was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies .   sex - you can learn from movies .   but robberies ?   there 's no way . 
or that !   look you guys i just want to provide a future for my baby .   i know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand .   i could open that safe in my sleep ! 
and hannah you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids sally struthers advertises . 
do n't martha - fucking - stewart me !   if you do n't like it - you try being a pregnant teen ! 
wait petunia .   mommy 's a little amped up - did n't get her yard time this morning .   mink ai n't my bitch .   she 's a specialist ... in banks . 
what ? !   hush up you mouthy little shit ! 
kansas i want you to meet someone special . 
so you need my help ?   oh my g - d this is like asking me for help with your homework .   hey mink c'mere ! 
well shit - fire kansas that 's the sweetest goddamn thing ever ... 
before you ?   whoo - hoo ! 
gee i 'll sit out this afternoon 's coffee talk .   whaddya want ? 
now how the hell can i help you ? 
my what ? 
so could half the women in here .   and i 'd rather go out with a nice can ... so watcha here for ?   to say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me ... 
i know but it keeps down the size of my can . 
thank g - d.   i was starting to think i 'd killed the wrong man . 
goodbye mr. gillis . 
i just think pictures should say a little something . 
schaefer .   betty schaefer .   and right now i wish i could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me . 
just a rehash of something that was n't very good to begin with . 
it 's from hunger . 
hello mr. sheldrake .   on that bases loaded .   i covered it with a 2 - page synopsis .   but i would n't bother . 
joe i ca n't look at you any more . 
if you love me joe . 
come on joe . 
no no ! i have n't heard any of this .   i never got those telephone calls .   i 've never been in this house ... get your things together . let 's get out of here . 
i did n't come here to see a house . what about norma desmond ? 
why did she call me ? 
that was norma desmond on the phone ? 
whose house is it ? 
this is where you live ? 
i do n't know why i 'm so scared joe .   is it something awful ? 
you did . 
of course i love him .   i always will .   i 'm just not in love with him any more . 
i do n't want it now . 
he wants me to come on to arizona . he says it only oosts two dollars to get married there .   it would kind of save us a honeymoon . 
it 's nothing .   i got a telegram from artie . 
i just do n't . 
something came up .   i do n't want to talk about it . 
was i ?   i 'm sorry . 
twenty - two . 
it must be my new shampoo . 
if you please . 
not once .   what 's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras ? it 's really more fun . 
not at all .   it taught me a little sense .   i got me a job in the mail room worked up to the stenographic . now i 'm a reader ... 
should be .   it cost three hundred dollars . 
third .   grandma did stunt work for pearl white .   i come from a picture family .   naturally they took it for granted i was to become a great star .   so i had ten years of dramatic lessons diction dancing . then the studio made a test .   well they did n't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little .   i went to a doctor and had it fixed .   they made more tests and they were crazy about my nose -- only they did n't like my acting . 
i was born just two blocks from this studio .   right on lemon grove avenue .   father was head elec- trician here till he died .   mother still works in wardrobe . 
look at this street .   all card- board all hollow all phoney . all done with mirrors .   i like it better than any street in the world .   maybe because i used to play here when i was a kid . 
it 's that old familiar story you help a timid little soul across a crowded street .   she turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money . 
i 'll say .   this is solid gold . 
i 'm sorry .   i do n't usually read private cigarette cases . 
who 's norma ? 
do n't you sometimes hate yourself ? 
it will ? 
what 's good about it ?   i miss him something fierce . 
oh you -- 
came   on back .   let me show you where it fits in . 
are you kidding ? because i think it 's good . 
honest to goodness i hate you . 
you 're tough all right . 
nobody can be that busy . 
i think so .   they 're on location in arizona shooting a western . i 'm free every evening every week- end .   if you want we could work at your place . 
we 're engaged . 
could n't we work in the evenings ? six o'clock in the morning ? this next month i 'm completely at your disposal .   artie is out of town . 
i 'm not good enough to write it alone .   we 'll have to do it together . 
i 'll make it short . 
now i see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school .   the first time they meet ... 
this story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives their struggles .   here are people doing the most important job in the world and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re - sole their shoes .   to me it can be as exciting as any chase any gunplay . 
see if they make sense .   to begin with i think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer 's sick mind . 
you know i 'd take you up on that in a minute .   i 'm just not good enough to do it all by myself . 
why should you do that ? 
well for heaven 's sake ! 
you sure have . 
it 's not your career -- it 's mine . i kind of hoped to get in on this deal .   i do n't want to be a reader all my life .   i want to write . 
i tell you this is half sold . 
i 've got twenty pages of notes . i 've got a pretty good character for the man . 
where 's the story ? i bluffed it out with a few notions of my own . it 's really just a springboard . it needs work . 
into something for barbara stan- wyck .   they have a commitment with barbara stanwyck . 
he thinks it could be made into something . 
dark windows .   i got him all hopped up about it . 
sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher . 
i called your agent .   i called the screen writers guild .   finally your old apartment gave me some crestview number .   there was always somebody with an accent growling at me .   you were not there .   you were not to be spoken to .   they never heard of you . 
stop it artie will you ?   where have you been keeping your- self ? i 've got the most wonderful news for you . 
you do n't know how glad i am to see youl 
with a wildly beating heart . 
you wo n't .   i 'll get us a refill of this awful stuff . 
no phillip no .   we must be strong .   you 're still wearing the uniform of the coldstream guards !   furthermore you can have the phone now . 
phillip you 're mad ! 
are you hungry ? 
we could make some paper boats and have a regatta .   or should we just turn on the shower ? 
as for instance ? 
i 'm serious .   i 've got a few ideas . 
drop that attitude .   here 's some- thing really worth while . 
maybe that 's why it 's good . it 's true it 's moving .   now why do n't you use that character ... 
the flashback in the courtroom when she tells about being a school teacher . 
is there someplace we can talk ? 
except for about six pages . you 've got a flashback there ... 
i did n't . 
there 's one called .... window ... something with a window . 
i felt a little guilty so i got out some of your old stories . 
i 've been hoping to run into you . 
you forgot this . 
hurt feelings department . 
let me help you .   betty schaeter sheldrake 's office . 
so you take plot 27 - a make it glossy make it slick -- 
perhaps the reason i hated bases loaded is that i knew your name . i 'd always heard you had some talent . 
i 'm sorry mr. gillis but i just do n't think it 's any good . i found it flat and banal . 
i 'm not worried .   everything will be fine .   the old team together . nothing can stop us . 
did you see them ? did you see how they came ? 
and if you had n't been pretty darned interested in that script he would n't have tried to get me on the phone ten times . 
do n't play innocent .   somebody named gordon cole . 
then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants . 
that 's no excuse .   you read the script did n't you ? 
you 'd better .   i 'm very angry . 
last time i saw you was someplace very gay .   i remember waving to you . i was dancing on a table . 
hello mr. demille . 
but remember darling -- i do n't work before ten in the morning and never after 4:30 in the afternoon . 
i do n't care about the money . i just want to work again .   you do n't know what it means to know that you want me . 
it 's a good script is n't it ? 
we 'll be working again wo n't we chief ? we 'll make our greatest picture . 
nothing .   i just did n't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio .   i had no idea how i 'd missed it . 
no one leaves a star .   that makes one a star . 
i 'm the greatest star of them all . 
you heard him .   i 'm a star ! 
that is n't true ! max ? 
that 's a lie !   they want me they want me !   i get letters every day ! 
wanted what ? 
what about the studio ? what about de mille ? 
that 's a lie !   they still want me ! 
you do n't care .   do you ?   but hundreds of thousands of people will carel 
see you did n't believe me ! .. now i suppose you do n't think i have the courage ! 
you think i made that up about the gun ... 
you ca n't do this !   max !   max ! ... i ca n't face life without you and i 'm not afraid to die you know . 
these are nothing .   you can have anything you want if you 'll only stay .   what is it you want -- money ? 
it 's yours joe .   i gave it to you . 
no you 're not .   max ! max ! 
what are you doing joe ?   what are you doing ?   you 're not leaving me ? 
of course you have n't .   i would n't let you . 
of course not joe .   it 's just that i do n't want to be left alone . not now while i 'm under this terrible strain .   my nerves are being torn apart .   all i ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind . 
no you did n't .   you took the car . 
i just happen to know it .   i had a nightmare and i screamed for you .   you were n't here .   where were you ? 
you went out last night did n't you joe ? 
you 'd better get to bed yourself . 
i was a little worried about the line of my throat .   this woman has done wonders with it . 
i 've lost half a pound since tuesday . 
i just came to say good night . i do n't want you to see me -- i 'm not very attractive . 
do n't turn around .   keep your eyes on the book . 
he'a a shrewd old fox .   he can smell box office .   only i 'm going to outfox him a litt1e .   this is n't going to be c. b. demille 's salome . it 's going to be norma desmond 's salome a norma desmond production starring norma desmond ... home max . 
it could n't have gone better . it 's practically set .   of course he has to finish this picture first but mine will be his next . 
thank you darling . 
do n't you want to come along darling ? 
i know that trick ! he wants to belittle me .   he 's trying to get my price down .   i 've waited twenty years for this call .   now mr. demille can wait till i 'm good and ready . 
how do you like that ? we 've made twelve pictures together . his greatest successes . 
all right .   give me this .   i need it for a moustache .   now close your eyes . 
i can still see myself in the line : bebe daniels marie prevost mabel normand ... mabel was always stepping on my feet ... what 's the matter with you darling ?   why are you so glum ? 
where are my cigarettes ? 
what on earth darling ? it took you hours . 
you 're a darling . 
they 're awful .   they make me cough . 
so he said it quite a few years ago .   so what ?   i never looked better in my life .   do you know why ?   because i 've never been as happy in my life . 
i 'm not just selling the script . i 'm selling me .   demille always said i was his greatest star . 
demille is leo .   i 'm scorpio . mars has been transmitting jupiter for weeks .   today is the day of greatest conjuction . now turn around .   let me dry you . 
this is the right day . 
i 'll do it again i 'll do it again i 'll do it again ! 
why do n't you just say thank you and go go go -- 
go away .   go to that girl of yours . 
great stars have great pride . 
to fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing . 
go away . 
what you 're trying to say is that you do n't want me to love you .   is that it ? 
who ? some car hop or a dress extra ? 
what right ? do you want me to tell you ? 
what 's the matter with you ? 
i own three blocks downtown . i have oil in bakersfield -- pumping pumping pumping . what 's it for but to buy us anything we want . 
shut up .   i 'm rich .   i 'm richer than all this new hollywood trash . i 've got a million dollars . 
i 'm in love with you .   do n't you know that ? i 've been in love with you all along . 
is it funny that i 'm in love with you ? 
you think this is all very funny . 
hold me tighter . 
there are no other guests .   we do n't want to share this night with other people .   this is for you and me . 
do n't bend back like that . 
just follow me . 
careful it 's slippery .   i had it waxed . 
cute .   let 's have some drinks . 
i do n't like those studs they 've sent .   i want you to have pearls . nice big pearls . 
come here ! 
come on ! 
joe   you look absolutely divine .   turn around ! 
you 'll need them for parties . you 'll need them for new year 's eve .   where are your evening clothes ? 
of course you do .   a tuxedo and tails . 
how about some evening clothes ? 
why begrudge me a little fun ? i just want you to look nice my stray little boy . 
nothing if you work in a fill- ing station .   and i 'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket and those same baggy pants .   max what 's a good men 's shop in town ?   the very best ... well go there ! 
that 's a dreadful shirt you 're wearing . 
now you 're being silly .   we do n't need two cars .   we have a car .   and not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit .   an isotta - fraschini .   have you ever heard of isotta - fraschinis ?   all hand - made .   cost me twenty - eight thousand dollars . 
oh ... and i thought it was a matter of life and death . 
now what is it ?   where 's the fire ? 
ca n't you wait till i 'm dummy ? 
please .   now i 've forgotten how many spades are out . 
not now my dear .   i 'm playing three no trump . 
they do n't ?   then why do they still write me fan letters every day . why do they beg me for my photo- graphs ?   because they want to see me me me !   norma desmond . 
cut away from me ? 
what scene ? 
what 's that ? 
suppose you make up your mind . do you want this job or do n't you ? 
now now do n't let 's be small about such matters .   we wo n't keep books .   go on unpack mr. gillis ' things . 
you proud boy why did n't you tell me you were having difficulties . 
it 's all taken care of .   it 's all paid for . 
you ca n't work in an apartment where you owe three months ' rent . 
you 'll like it here . 
i do n't know why you should be so upset .   stop that playing max .   it seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together . 
you can stay here . 
there 's something wrong with your car you said . 
where do you live ? 
are you married mr.   -- ? 
oh no .   i could n't let it out of my house .   you 'll have to finish it here . 
i would n't worry about money . i 'll make it worth your while . 
i do n't care . 
i want you to do this work . 
sagittarius .   i like sagittarians . you can trust them . 
what month ? 
who ?   i 'd have to have somebody i can trust .   when were you born -- i mean what sign of the zodiac ? 
i will not have it butchered . 
what for ?   i can say anything i want with my eyes . 
i wrote that with my heart . 
of course it is . 
i am not afraid .   read it ! 
they will love it every place .   read it .   read the scene just before she has him killed ! 
salome -- what a woman ! what a part ! the princess in love with a holy man .   she dances the dance of the seven veils .   he rejects her so she demands his head on a golden tray kissing his cold dead lips . 
i hate that word .   it is a return . a return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen . 
who else ? 
we 've made a lot of pictures together . 
it 's the story or salome .   i think i 'll have demille direct it . 
this is to be a very important picture .   i have written it myself .   took me years . 
how long is a movie script these days ?   i mean how many pages ? 
the wind gets in that blasted pipe organ .   i ought to have it taken out . 
and you have written pictures have n't you ? 
are you or are n't you ? 
you 're a writer you said . 
just a minute you ! 
get out ! 
you are ! writing words words ! you 've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl but there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles and technicolor to photograph the red swollen tongue ! 
look at them in the front offices -- the master minds ! they took the idols and smashed them .   the fairbankses and the chaplins and the gilberts and the valentinos . and who have they got now ?   some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish - poshl 
they 're dead .   they 're finished . there was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world .   but that was n't good enough .   oh nol they wanted the ears of the world too .   so they opened their big mouths and out came talk talk talk ... 
i am big .   it 's the pictures that got small . 
or shall i call my servant ? 
get out . 
it is not .   get out . 
how much will it be ?   i warn you - do n't give me a fancy price just because i 'm rich . 
i do n't care anyway .   i want the coffin to be white .   and i want it specially lined with satin . white or deep pink . 
oh yes yes .   they 're below waiting for the princess ... i 'm ready . 
what is the scene ? where am i ? 
they have ?   thank you max .   tell mr. demille i will be on the set at once . 
cameras ? ... what is it max ? 
thank you max . 
say that i 'm busy and hang up . 
certainly it 's important .   it 's important enough for mr. demille to call me personally .   the idea of having an assistant call me ! 
now now do you belive me ? i told you demille would jump at it . 
you know better than to interrupt me . 
wait a minute .   i want you to get out the car .   you 're going to take the script over to paramount and deliver it to mr. de mille in person . 
bring something to drink . 
what do you mean we ? 
at last . ultimate power . 
that little girl ? ha .   now go on get me some tools . 
i do n't feel like it right now . 
shut up and get me a hacksaw . 
no way . i 'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me . 
yes . whatever i say .   from now on . 
i think i 'd better keep it . 
next time remind me to do this out in the yard . 
what do i do ?   i do n't know her name . 
i 've been saving it . for the right moment . 
am i ? still ? 
that 's easy for you to say bianca . 
why did she have to show up now ? 
no a super girl . 
it 's what we were warned about . 
he will be . in about five minutes . 
bianca try not to be so bloodthirsty when you 're at the wheel . ok ? 
we 'll bide our time and keep watch . young girls just ca n't keep a secret . if one of them 's up to something -- we'll find out . 
drive on . we have already attracted enough attention . 
it must be the girls . one of the girls . 
oh fiddlesticks . what could be dangerous about a baseball game ? 
what does it mean ? 
the coffer of shadow . look at it . 
i said stop i did n't say run into a brick wall . 
there 's no such thing as an accident . everything has meaning if you can read the signs . 
it 's a warning that 's for sure . 
i 'm sorry but i already promised bianca she could have switzerland . you know how she loves to ski . 
what do you want ? 
that one was for you . but i thought i 'd wait and see how you behave when supergirl gets here . i 'd hate to lose you ethan . 
i 'm ready for her . i 'll show you . 
you ca n't put her out of your mind is that it ? 
you 're a regular einstein are n't you ? 
guess ! go on . 
they want me . does n't it make you proud ? 
careful do n't make me angry . i start fires when i 'm angry . 
you 've been without water for a whole day . let 's see how thirsty you get in a week . 
go on   talk big ! i 'll soon have you purring like a kitten . 
i could force you . 
i never met a man i could n't have -- and you 're no different from the rest ! 
come back to my house . my car 's outside . 
this is your problem right here . this girl 's driving you insane ethan . let me help you . 
do n't think i 'm weak just because i 'm a woman . i have power . give in stop fighting me ethan . i always get what i want . 
you ca n't escape from me that easily . i 'm afraid you do n't know who i am . 
forget her you 're mine . i saw you first . 
yes yes i saw the whole thing . how could you be interested in that puny little girl ? 
it 's the truth . in twenty - four hours you 'll forget all about that girl . 
and you think you 're in love . 
what an adorable hat . 
to us . and to the seeds we 'll plant together . 
a passionfruit smoothee . 
oh you know how parties are . always some damage . 
i bet they do . 
you must be very popular in the neighborhood . i always see your truck parked around . 
come in have a drink we 'll talk . 
finished your estimate ? 
call me next week . maybe we can have lunch . 
i 've got things to do . 
george --- i thought you 'd never ask . 
why george are you proposing ? 
better eat it quick . it wo n't look too pretty when it 's all covered with ants . 
maybe you 'd like to get rid of this supergirl yourself nigel ? 
which of you is willing to make that sacrifice ? 
we are in great danger . a being has come to earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the craft . 
such a shame . you ought to take better care of yourself . 
i was just thinking if i had your skin problems i 'd use a good tannisroot ointment . every night . 
i could teach you a thing or two now . 
you 're wasting your breath . 
nigel get lost . 
throw him out . 
you scorpios can never take a joke . 
i need you like an eskimo needs a lawnmower . now burn rubber . 
nigel get out of here . and do n't come slithering back . nigel shakes his head . 
bianca 's taught me all ! need to know . i 'll be safe as long as i do n't go too far . 
i just did . because i have the power . 
i have plans nigel . you could come with me ... i 'm going places . 
cheer up nigel . it 's not the end of the world . 
yes i see it . shining like a jewel . 
where is inner space ? 
sounds o.k. to me . let 's go . 
what 's it like ? 
ever since i found that thing i 've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare . you have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time . 
i 'm free . i can never thank you enough . 
not yet . 
the danvers . and two of your little friends . 
a cheap trick . 
i am selena . give him to me . now . or you 'll both be sorry . 
that was meant for me ! 
and the first thing we do is get rid of supergirl ! 
there 's no need . i learned the craft from my grandmother . 
she did n't take it from you did she ? 
sure glad you did n't let make a monkey of you . 
is it her that 's bothering you -- or your gardener ? 
whatever you say . 
yes of course it was foolish of me . 
the naming of names is not necessary . just concentrate on her face . your shadow will do the rest . 
that moment is now ! what good is a sword unless it be unsheathed ? use it and no one will dare oppose you again . no one . 
yes ! you own the coffer of shadow . nothing can withstand its power . 
you can do it . you 're the most powerful woman on earth . 
eliminate her . 
a storm dragon ? 
i came as quickly as i could . what is the danger ? 
have fun . 
is he your entertainment for tonight ? 
sorry mistress . 
and then like great cats --- we pounce ! and destroy ! 
but which one ? 
the danger . the one nigel spoke of . it must be near . 
what is it ? 
do you want to come to argo city ? 
i 'll come back as soon as i can . 
how do i fight it ? 
you 've had your fun selena the game is over . 
and you can see how you feel about me right ? 
you 'll be safe here . i 'll come back as soon as i have the power source . 
i can see through walls . i could surprise her . the only thing i ca n't see through is lead that 's why i did n't see the power source at the amusement park . 
that 's the power source that was lost from argo city ! that 's what i came : to find ! where does she live ? 
there 's something very dangerous about her . something evil ... 
are n't you forgetting about selena ? 
feelings are real . once you 've had them they 're yours forever . 
i do n't see why not . 
and now ? 
miss what ? 
it seemed that way to me . 
hello . are you still mad at me ? 
but i do n't understand . 
i sort of like what you said . 
but why ? 
just like that ? 
what would n't last ? what 's the matter with you ? 
ethan --- when i said ' a while ' i meant a couple of hours . 
but i have to go back . i brought you here so you 'd be safe . from her . 
i thought i 'd show you one of my favourite places . 
is this how ? 
well ... i guess one is all right . 
of course not but ... there are things we do n't understand . 
what 's that ? 
of course i do n't hate you . i   do n't hate anyone . 
all this talk about love it 's silly . 
we 're from different worlds . 
we ca n't do that . 
but be reasonable . if i do n't do something to stop her she 'll try again . and maybe hurt you . 
tell me where i can find her . 
ethan tell me more about this woman who 's after you . 
it 's not important . the important thing is i 'm here to find something and i think you can he1p me . 
no . argo city . it was on a chunk of rock that was part of krypton once --- but we moved it to inner space . 
yes . it reminds me of home . 
are you sure it 's all right for us to be here ? 
we have to have a long talk about all this . 
you love me ? 
who did n't ? 
relax . tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream . goodbye . 
i have to . 
i 'm taking you to the hospital . 
it 's for your own protection . 
that 's home . 
they 'll be grateful . if you had n't found it it would still be lost . look up ahead . 
it 's everywhere . but water is always the door . 
it 's the most beautiful place in the universe . 
your nightmares are over . i 'm taking this back to argo city where it wo n't be misused .   you could come too . it might be safer for you . 
for what ? 
you 've run out of things to throw selena . 
it 's just one more crime you 'll have to pay for . 
cheap but effective . 
that ought to keep you out of my hair for a while . 
i do n't scare that easily . 
who are you ?

she 's a beast . 
oh wow i should 've known . me and my big mouth . listen you can borrow any of my clothes you want . any time .

someone 's chasing him . 
oh no thanks . 
well lucy it 's nice to see you 're feeling better . nice to meet you jimmy . 
he 's off doing a top secret uh investigation . 
i believe there 's a rational explanation for everything . but i do n't know what it is . 
nice to meet you . 
i have to get back . i 'm having dinner with the danvers . 
he 's nice . 
i 'm afraid i have some bad news about your car . 
lucy ; come back ! 
why is he acting so strangely ? 
it does n't seem right . 
oh i do n't know . i 'm not signed out for an overnight . 
no thanks . you go on . 
it was just a trim . 
but what for ? 
must 've been a defective puck . 
she did that deliberately . 
thank you . you 're very kind . 
my cousin clark is my only relative on earth . 
i 'd rather not talk about it . 
i have money to buy more but i have n't had a chance since ... 
there is n't any . 
i can do that . 
sure . mate in five moves . 
thank you both so much . it was a lovely lunch mrs. danvers . i had a wonderful time . and you 're a terrific chess player mr . danvers . 
i 'd love to . 
no mr . danvers . 
i mean it would probably be there if you received it . 
i 'm linda lee . 
oh yes . knocking . the pre - entry signal . i forgot . 
i guess he misses a lot of dinners . 
well he 's going to get the best home - cooked meal he 's had in ... in a long time . you tell superman we think he 's wonderful . 
me too . that 's why i put this one up . 
well are n't you excited ? 
he really was ! 
the dog 's always doing that .   and the car 's always doing that . 
oh i would n't want to -- i mean i 'd want to but i would n't want to ... be a nuisance to you . 
no what you said before could i make it in metropolis ? i 've dreamed about it sure but i never really thought about it .   what would i do when i got there ? 
that 's the biggest change in smallville you know . they 've taken over this town . everybody who is n't actually working for wheat king -- like i do -- is out there --   on a wheat king thresher .   do you think i could do it ? do you ? 
no . i mean yes they are but i was talking about that .   wheat king . bet your bottom dollar that 's a wheat king thresher . 
i can never get a way from it . 
so ... how much longer do you think you 'll be in smallville -- 
gee i have n't laughed like that since -- since --   i really ca n't remember when . 
pate ? what pate ?   i did n't make any --   oh no clark . that 's buster 's dog food . 
no i mean ricky . he 's not interested in any of this stuff . 
peanut butter and jelly . 
no all the good ones are married . that 's why brad thinks he 's god 's gift to women . this woman anyway . he 's single . he wo n't take no for an answer but he 's the only one who 's asking . and he knows it . 
and even nicer when there 's a man around which is n't all that often . 
i 'm talking about salt .   oh go ahead pour it on relax . that 's what picnics are for . 
clark i think you worry too much about mayonnaise . 
some people do n't think it 's healthy . 
i mean him . 
it is n't only that he 's small for his age . how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father ?   look at him he 's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon . 
i just ca n't stand this . 
that song . i remember one day i came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano . and i thought -- what am i going to do with all this potato salad ? 
you ... um ... you never got married ? 
ricky . my little boy . at least here we 've got a house . and i 've got a job . okay i 'm only a secretary oaky but it pays the bills . except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up .   i even had to pawn my diamond ring then . 
that 's easy to say . but how ? and what about ricky ? 
no the problem is --   why do i stay in smallville ? believe me i 've asked myself the same question . do you know how lucky you are to live in metropolis ?   the big apricot . 
mayonnaise ? donald loved mayonnaise . why would you think that was the problem . ? 
you know what 's the problem ? 
there must be a gallon of potato salad left over . 
and three years after the royal wedding the king abdicated .   is n't that terrible ? 
you 'd be surprised how many offers i did n't get . even brad would n't stick around for this .   it really is n't easy . 
for reminding me i mean . can you follow me ? 
and here i am just standing here . that 's terrible . thank you . 
you look wonderful . 
listen are you sure you should n't do something about the bridge ? 
but the bridge ... 
he was asleep before his head hit the pillow .   well this was only the biggest day of his life . i really do n't know how to thank you . 
well ... i guess they did get a little carried away . 
and this is ...   ... clark .   my friend is around here somewhere i 'll just look for ... 
oh . i 'm lana lang . this is ricky . 
thank ... you . 
ricky ?   where ... what ... 
will you stop interrupting ? !   you will command the pumps to stop pumping . 
you will command the tankers to sail toward a 50 - mile area in the middle of the atlantic ocean . 
oh bubba think of the possibilities . 
sister ! i 'm his sister ! 
i ca n't ! it 's out of control ! 
cut the mush lorelei . he 's after our skin ! 
you ! activate circuits 29 through w7 and start full power coordinates on exterior defensive systems : 
superman . the boy you left behind . 
come on will you ?   we 've got to get ready before he gets here . 
where do you usually find a light switch ? 
turn on the light . 
so i understand from the graffiti i 've seen . 
how would you know ? 
why stop at coffee !   a cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning but what keeps the world working ? 
if you do n't mind we are trying to hold a meeting here ! 
bubba does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking ... ! 
yes ! this time we got it right ! 
do n't bet on it ! 
like fish he is .   i know enough about computers to put a phd to shame .   come now brother dear you did n't think i was going to let that little man run the show did you ? gus gorman telling us what to do -- i 'd sooner kiss a pig ! 
who needs gus ? 
come on let 's give it a dry run . 
not quite . what is that in the lower right hand corner ? 
we can get to work on that oil ! 
a normal person . 
where did it come from ? 
what 's wrong ? 
how ? shoot him ? you know about him and bullets . not to mention knives tanks bombs ... 
do n't cry bubba . 
chicken feed .   if gus gorman can push the right buttons --- 
small potatoes . 
someplace where nobody knows him so they ca n't connect him with us . 
she 's not his mama either . 
somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the aerospace center and reach vulcan . 
blizzards ! heat waves ! 
it could make weather ! 
vulcan is the weather satellite our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather . 
i do n't kiss . 
that 's what i want to know ! by whom ? whom ? ? ? ? 
everything on it . 
sure . especially if you 'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go -- 
well you should . because i appreciate you too you know . 
clark stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name . nobody expects you to be what you 're not . 
. . . superman ? . . . . . 
i 'm fine . . . . . .   what   was i talking about ?   before ? 
see what happens when i do n't have my orange juice ?   the human body is only a workable fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you 'd show to ----   . . . gee . . . 
oh i 'm not blaming you .   i just know me . i 'd be jealous . jealous of . . . of all humanity .   some rival huh ? 
oh when it comes to you i am . not that i do n't understand why they all need you . but they ca n't need you more than i do . 
never closed my eyes . 
oh hi . 
do n't . . . it 's not your fault . . . you did n't know . . . 
but what can you do ? there 's no way now . . . 
i do n't want a bodyguard . i want the man i fell in love with . 
let 's get you inside . . . . 
clark . . . it does n't matter . . . we can move . . . 
you did it . you gave it all up for me . i . . . i do n't know what to say . 
your place ?   maybe i should change   maybe you should too . 
i want to . 
i 'm listening . 
i 'm in love with you . how do you feel ? 
well not in your mind but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . . 
maybe you wanted to . 
i was right . you are superman . 
it 's true . it 's true . 
oh clark no ! 
because of what i 'm betting .   my life . 
uh - uh .   listen i 'll tell you what . you say i 'm wrong . and i say i 'm right . so why do n't we make a little bet on it ? 
listen i 've got to give you credit . your disguise is nearly perfect . i mean if you fooled me and i am nobody 's fool -- 
do n't fake me out clark .   or whoever you are . 
and you were n't . as usual . what do you say to that ? 
i mean it strikes me funny that every time superman comes around you disappear . 
where were you ? 
frankly once you 've seen superman in action niagara falls tends to leave you cold . 
aw c'm on -- anybody can get hungry . 
hey are you hungry ? i 'm hungry . 
that 's because you can hardly see through those things . 
oh sure everything is complimentary . until you get the bill . 
yeah thanks . . . . i mean really ! posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in niagara falls .   i mean . imagine wasting a great reporter -   -- uh reporters -- on this .   perry white and his sunday magazine exposes . 
hah some guys say i have magic fingers . 
in july ? ? ? 
of course that 's what friends are for . 
clark everything i was saying -- ca n't you see i only say it because i really care ? 
be my guest . 
have n't you heard ? there 's an energy crisis .   no this was good enough for my mother -- 
well you should n't   be more aggressive clark ! trust your instinct ! when you see your opportunity grab it ! i do . 
sure ! but nobody knows it . least of all you .   look would you mind if i gave you some constructive criticism ? 
of course not . not when you 've got so much going for you . 
oh sure . the american answer to everything . pills .   no this is --   -- natural . 
well you never will again !   thanks to vitamin c ! i 'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of vitamin c every day . 
when was the last time you heard me sneeze ? 
do i detect a note of jealousy ? 
then maybe you should get your glasses checked . 
but him is you .   now i 'm confused . 
it must be tough having to be clark kent . 
hey do n't worry . you 'll be fine just . . . well do n't rush it . 
like it ? it 's magnificent !   not that it could n't use a woman 's touch . especially around dinner time . 
i must be . but i 'm not .   your home . this is your home . 
the bomb ! it 's in there ! any second now its -- 
superman ! the -- 
maybe if you 'd have met who i am now instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago it would have been different between us . 
you know : strong gentle tall men with bright blue eyes and square . men who like to dance slow the old fashioned way the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom . 
any more like you back home clark ? 
you do n't have to be polite clark . i 've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me . 
daddy 's offered me jobs at some of his other companies . but i 've been thinking maybe i 'll take some time off .   i 'm going to find a place like smallville in the country . maybe a   farm . . .   see what the slow lane is like . 
no mind it 's only antique irish linen . 
let 's sit down . they walk to the table . lois calls out to the balcony . 
clark . . . ! 
i missed you . it was n't any fun up there with just lois and superman . they 're so boring . let 's go do something wild ! 
should n't you pay the cabbie ? 
. . . let me get my purse . 
come early . the view is so romantic from my balcony . 
i 'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we 'll have high tea . it 's very chic . 
then prove it . lois is doing an interview with superman about his peace mission . . . 
he 's a jerk . i never noticed it before . seems like a lot of people i know are jerks . . .   . . . maybe you think the same thing about me . that 's why you keep avoiding me . 
now you try clark . we 'll start you off with 60 pounds . 
do n't give up . this is a perfect subject for your series on young metropolis . now let 's get those knees up ! 
i feel kind of light - headed . . . 
no realistic . there 's no magic in the world . girls just do n't get swept off their feet anymore . 
do n't tell me you 're waiting for lightning to strike . wide - eyed romantics are an endangered species . 
what about here ? 
that 's not what we were taught . ' look out for number one ' -- that 's daddy 's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold . 
my prom was so boring . we all flew to paris the next day to recover . . . sometimes my whole life seems boring . i thing maybe i should just give everything away and go live among the poor people . then i remember how smashing i look in sable . . . oh it 's all so confusing . you think i 'm silly do n't you ? 
do n't tell me . you learned to dance at church socials . 
this is metropolis after hours ! this is what you 'll be writing about . c'm on let 's dance . 
oh clark you 're so delightfully primitive . 
you 're late . very late . 
do n't worry . i wo n't make you do it alone . i know all the right places . i 'm a member at all the right clubs . . . we 'll start tonight at the grand opening of the metro club ! it 's a date ! 
that 's just it ! you do n't have to flaunt it . you 're no slave to fashion ... although ... 
but you 're perfect for it . you 're young you 're single you 're successful ... 
it 's brilliant . daddy thinks so too . you 'll write a new series -- ' metropolis after hours . ' 
no daddy . our business is journalism . we ca n't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we 'll just lead everyone into a disaster . 
i 'd just like to have a little less sensationalism . 
stuff it . 
daddy . . . ? 
i know daddy . i 'm worried about him . 
oh . . . no . . . i mean we just went   dancing . . . for   a story . . . 
who does clark kent think he is anyway ! he never even said good night ! 
not so fast !   all trips are canceled . we pay for wire services . and what we do n't get from them we 'll invent . 
he was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .   oh it 's a long story . 
what 's that ? 
what 's he going to say ? 
why lois i did n't know . . . who is he ? 
right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . . 
lois have you ever fallen for a guy and he 's not like other guys . . . he 's different . it 's like you come from two different worlds . 
clark . he 's late again .   i ca n't figure him out . 
i know i 'm not exactly a girl scout but . . . maybe if i show him i 'm trying . . . he 'll like me . 
daddy loves to whip up campaigns ! people eat it up . we 'll make this kid a celebrity . the whole world will be waiting for superman 's answer . 
i think there 's an angle . 
superman gets mail here ? 
but all men like me lois . i 'm very rich . 
i think he 's kind of cute . 
is he for real ? 
yes but i 'm the only one who knows him . i   --   i really like the guy . and he likes me .   i think . i mean i could talk to him you know ? and he could talk to me .   anytime ... 
oh what a chance ! if i could just   --   get to him . 
it is n't that i still do n't like you clark . it 's just that ... well once you 've had something like that happen to you it kind of changes a girl .   i 'm going to make some coffee . you want some ? 
they will once i hang it on him in tomorrow 's edition . 
superman .   pretty good name for him is n't it ? 
of this ... superman . 
you 're just jealous . 
why would he do that ? how would he know i was going to suddenly slip . 
he grabbed me ! he held me ! he set me down gently ! how could that be done with mirrors ? 
there were n't any wires . i looked . 
clark kent if you had only seen it the way i did you - 
it was n't a trick ! 
i 'm telling you i was there . 
not unless you can fly . 
there 's no real proof that tobacco   -- 
for what ? oh i 've see the way the other half lives . my sister for instance . it looks terrific but is that what i really want ? three kids two cats and fifteen needlepoint pillows ? i 'd go bananas after one week . hell i need this crazy existence of mine .   like i need the plague right ? that 's what your thinking . 
it 's not what you think . darn it . i 'm going out on a story . the secretary of defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid 's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he 'd rather duck . 
thanks clark but i 'm booked for the night . 
big night coming up ? 
what now my love ? 
you described the exact contents of my purse . 
you 're great with the advice clark . maybe you 'd better take over the lovelorn column . 
oh for god 's sake ! 
stop him clark ! 
not in metropolis it is n't . this is the home of the sneak attack the stab in the back the -- 
see ? did n't i tell you this was a tough town ? 
' swell . ' when   was the last time i heard anybody say   -   where are you from   anyway ? 
some people are n't the athletic type . 
well how are you enjoying your first day on the job ? 
are there any more at home like you ? 
not ... gray . 
i know . he sends a check every week to his dear gray - haired old mother . 
your bookie ? 
hey you 're getting a better class of people in your office these days boss . 
need i ask who 's favored to collect at the end of this week . 
it 's because i 'm an intrepid girl reporter jimmy .   besides the chief of detectives has the hots for me . 
gets you where you live huh ? 
' and the people on the street the little man who runs the corner newsstand the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare . ' 
he is . usually . 
nine to five it 's a pulitzer prize i know . 
okay but ... why ?   no offense . 
here 's the story on that east 19th street murder spree . page one with a banner headline seems about right to me . 
where do you hail from ? 
do you like pink ? 
can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound ? 
what color underwear am i wearing ? 
do bullets really bounce off you ? 
is it true you 're impervious to pain ? 
can you really see through anything ? 
what about this x - ray vision of yours ? 
how much do you weigh ? 
how old are you ? 
it must feel great . 
well i mean it 's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it . 
i did n't mean that in any pejorative way . 
okay . let 's start with these strange powers of yours . 
oh .   well where do we start ? 
oh i 've got to get some matches .   my cigarette . 
not exactly . he 's kind of a rewrite man . actually he 's a bit dull if you know what i mean . 
if i do you can punish   me . fly me to bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks .   this is fantastic ! i wish clark were here . 
well ... flashlight ? 
this is incredible . i was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you . i mean you do n't have an answering service right ? 
the answer is yes . now what 's the question ? 
wha' ... what are you doing here ? 
superman ? ? ? 
with my luck now it 'll rain . 
who ... who ... 
oh god ! i 'm going to die ! 
you 've got me ? who 's got you ? ? ? 
what can i tell you ? he 's my leader . 
could n't we forget the plane ? you could lift me in your big strong arms ? 
the way you describe him does n't really do him justice . 
he wants to see you . lex luthor . 
help ! i mean   --   i ca n't stop saying it . silly is n't it   -   there 's nothing to worry about . help ! see . 
you too .   i just ... i ca n't get it on for good guys . y'know ? 
you ca n't do this to me ! 
i mean the other one ! 
good . fine . now where 's my parachute ? 
where 's mine ? ! where 's my parachute ? 
danger ? ?   somebody ? ? ? lex   -- where are you going ? 
what if he does n't show up ? what if he 's taking a nap ? 
what are you going to do to him ? 
oh . why ? does he live up here ? 
i did n't bring any   -- 
this all has something to do with superman does n't it ? 
i do n't understand . 
a night on the town instead of under it ? 
i know ... 
i knew you 'd hit me . 
you 're not going to hit me ? 
there was a recipe on the back   -- 
you ? ! how about me ? 
but if i put my leg out like claudette clobert in   -- 
you ever try to run in high heels ?   you probably did . 
i do n't like to talk about it lex . 
the least we can do is leave him another door jam . 
we just take it ? 
you 're not going to tell us why you 're happy are you ? 
you 're happy are n't you ? 
i will as soon as i get the sand out of my nose . 
i know i 'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this but so what ? 
i do n't mean to denigrate your misspent youth lex but what does that rock have to do with -- 
mr. romance ... 
i 'm going to bed . 
i read the article . 
krypton ? the place where superman comes from ? 
fifty degrees below and still falling . 
place your bets ladies and gentlemen . 
i did n't say a word . 
bet he makes it . 
tough guy huh ? 
you think he 's for real ? 
again ? ? ? 
speaking of feeding things what about dinner ? 
even that would be an improvement . 
streets sunlight . when was the last time i saw sunlight . 
so i 've noticed . 
this ? ? 
your father was a sick weirdo . 
why does it all mean so much to you ? all the time ' land land land . ' 
it is n't a park avenue address . really . 
you and your real estate . 
goodnight mr. ansel . 
oh .   right . 
what do you mean ' outgrown it ' ? 
no .   i mean i remember mrs. ansel wearing some of this stuff but ... i do n't feel funny about that .   i really liked her . 
i do n't know . 
it just seems ... kind of weird . 
are you sure ? 
was it good ? 
hi mr. ansel .   hi jessica mason ... 
it 's the truth . 
no .   what 's this lawyer business ? 
who 's mr. stephens ? 
from you ? 
is this mine ? 
i feel like a princess . 
it 's interesting . 
how was it ? 
and winter ? 
what happened to summer ? 
he thought it was cute when i called him frankenstein .   it was n't .   i feel like his monster . 
should i keep reading ? 
no .   not mean .   just ... very angry . 
because ... he wanted to them to be punished . 
that 's right . 
what mason ? 
do n't you usually like to sit at the back ?   to wave at your dad ? 
rats ! they fought the dogs and killed the cats and bit the babies in the cradles and ate the cheeses out of vats . and licked the soup from the cook 's own ladles split open the kegs of salted sprats made nests inside men 's sunday hats and even spoiled the women 's chats by drowning their speaking with shrieking and squeaking in fifty different sharps and flats ... 
it 's like a song . 
the pied piper of hamelin . by famous hanover city ; the river weser deep and wide washes its wall on the southern side ; a pleasanter spot you never spied ; but when begins my ditty ... 
it was snowing . 
you seem very sure about that . 
the truth is that it was an accident and no one 's to blame . 
i wo n't lie . 
what do you want me to do for you mr. stephens ? 
yes .   like bear and the ansel twins and sean and ... 
you can only feel lucky that you did n't die for so long .   then you start to feel ... unlucky . 
i do n't like thinking about the accident .   i do n't even remember it happening .   besides it just makes people feel sorry for me and ... 
i remember the bus swerved it just suddenly swerved to the right and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road and then it went over the embankment there and everyone was screaming and everything .   and that 's all .   i guess i was unconscious after that . that 's all .   then i was in the hospital . 
yes .   i do now .   now that i 'm telling it . 
no .   because the bus went off the road .   and crashed . 
i was scared .   and there was n't time . 
i told you i was positive .   the speedometer was large and easy to see from where i was . 
seventy - two miles an hour . 
yes .   i looked .   i remember clearly now .   it seemed we were going too fast down the hill .   i was scared . 
the speedometer .   and it was downhill there . 
dolores was driving too fast . 
yes i understand . 
i was scared . 
before the actual accident ? 
there was a brown dog that ran across the road up there right by the dump and dolores slowed down not to hit him and he ran into the woods .   and then dolores drove on and turned onto the marlowe road as usual .   i remember that .   i 'm remembering it pretty clearly . 
as i 'm talking i 'm remembering more about it . 
until the accident ?   no .   yes there was . 
my usual place .   on the right side . the first seat . 
like what ?   i mean i do n't remember a lot . 
no .   i was alone .   my sister jenny was sick and stayed home that day . 
about eight - thirty in the morning . 
someplace where no one knows her .   someplace strange and new . 
she 'll move away . 
will the police do anything to her ? 
what 's going to happen to dolores ? 
how about sunday night ?   that 's always the best time . 
he could n't look at me .   but i looked at him .   right at him .   his secret was mine now .   we used to share it .   but not anymore .   now i owned it completely . 
i mean i 'm a wheelchair girl now . it 's hard to pretend i 'm a beautiful rock star .   not like you used to tell me .   remember daddy ?   all the people that were going to discover me ?   where are they now ? 
as opposed to this t.v. ? 
how will he do that ? 
what about insurance ?   does n't insurance pay for these things ? 
but you did n't lose me . 
my lawyer ?   why do i need a lawyer ? 
you and mom have a lawyer ? 
that 's too high .   i 'll never reach it . 
the door needs a lock . 
it 's okay . 
very slick . 
the ramp ? 
they say i 'm lucky because i ca n't remember the accident . 
mrs.   ansel 's clothing . 
just the way dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals .   it 's like the biggest thing in her life . 
you do n't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure . 
you mean it ? 
why did you do that billy ? 
is it true that you gave nicole one of lydia 's dresses ?   that she was wearing it when the bus crashed ? 
because i have to . 
i have to . 
... or that the guardrail was n't strong enough . 
mr. stephens says that someone did n't put a right bolt in the bus ... 
something made this happen billy . mr. stephens is going to find out what it was . 
good night billy . 
you 're leaving . 
just like we look forward to this . 
they can look forward to that . 
your kids never cry . 
tomorrow i 'm going to put sean on the bus .   he wo n't want to go .   he never does .   he 'll cry and want to hold on to me . 
when the game 's over i guess . 
no .   it should be dry by now . 
billy do you have to smoke ? wendell can smell if someone 's been smoking . 
have you been waiting long ? 
ca n't you make it later ? 
billy that 's too early . 
wanda does these photographic things .   that 's one of her pictures on the wall . 
they 're smart .   been to college . they moved here from the city about a dozen years ago . 
wanda and hartley .   they lost bear . he was their adopted son .   a beautiful boy .   indian . 
there 's the prescots ... 
what do you mean ? 
... coming home drunk and i guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that ... and ... 
at school .   she fell for kyle just before we graduated .   got pregnant and ... went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot kyle 's dad used to own . kyle started spending more and more time at the spread eagle ... 
she ... she was a friend of mine . 
will you be spending more than a night ? 
you do n't know that . 
the ottos . 
but charlene ... 
well there 's the hamiltons .   joe and shelly hamilton . 
i do n't know .   but it was weird in terms of what happened next .   sean was still watching his mother . 
he never took his eyes off his mother even as he moved to sit beside nicole .   he looked frightened . 
yes .   abbot understands these things . 
anything you did n't understand ? 
you heard what abbott said ? 
who 's been talking to you about what i 'm feeling ?   who should care about what i 'm feeling ? 
what other people ? 
and billy told you that he 'll tell that to ... 
you 've talked to billy ? 
billy said that ? 
he knows that ?   billy ? 
because i 'd be to blame right ? 
i told you that i was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened .   that 's how i remembered it .   but the truth is i might have been doing sixty .   or sixty five . and if that 's true that i was over the limit when the bus went over what would happen then ? 
i have a question for you mr. stephens . 
the walkers loved sean .   he was their only child ... the object of all their attention .   i mean wendell 's a withdrawn sort of man .   that 's his nature .   but risa she 's still got dreams . 
what do you mean ? 
that 's right . 
what do you mean ? 
a strange little fellow but you could n't help liking him .   he was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six . 
with our hands . 
yes .   the old - fashioned way . 
abbott and i used to do a lot of that in the spring . 
yes .   like i was putting them into my big basket .   clearing the hillside of its children . 
that 's the way i thought of them sometimes . 
no .   i saw it on his face . 
no nothing like that .   billy 's wife lydia died of cancer a few years ago .   he took over raising the children by himself .   it was obvious how much he missed lydia . 
from what ? 
billy loved to see his kids in the bus .   they always sat in the back so they could wave to each other . it comforted him . 
those are all from the fair last year .   abbott and me were judges at the pet show . 
oh yes .   like i said they always came out together to see him off to school .   it 's like he was their little treasure .   he was such a beautiful boy .   that 's a picture of him on the wall there behind abbott . 
no nothing like that .   the ottos are what i 'd call model citizens . they 're regular at town meetings . they give their opinions   in a respectful way .   they always help out at various fund - raising bazaars in town   though they are n't church goers . 
i mean the way they look .   their hair and clothing ... 
about the ottos ? 
dolores .   no one calls me ' mrs. driscoll ' . 
the ottos always waited for the bus with bear .   they were the only parents who did that together like that .   i guess they 're what you might call hippies . 
oh it 's bizarre alright .   c'm on bear .   let 's get you out of here . 
i 'll just strap it on the roof . 
i did n't say that . 
well it 's certainly what you 'd call interesting . 
good morning wanda .   hi hartley . 
no !   no !   do n't touch me ! 
no .   i 'm going home . 
sometimes i think all men are fools ! ... 
j.j. steve is n't ... 
when i 'm certain i 'll let you know ... 
i 'm taking up the situation with you now ... 
i have n't said anything yet j.j. but if - 
i thought we were talking about sidney ? 
i said sidney ! ... 
sidney is a liar ! 
alan was not ... unbalanced when i married him .   and he was not ... 'indifferent to women ' no matter what they said ! hunsecker   i 'm not fighting with you puss ... 
then whose fault was it j.j. ?   it was someone 's fault was n't it ? 
it 's just as if i 've seen a ghost today ... 
history repeats itself .   everything that happened to alan leslie ... began with a smear like this ... 
no i 'm not .   i 'm not ! 
did sidney tell you about it ? 
do n't explain sidney ... it does n't matter now ... 
please sidney i ca n't stand this - 
... but you did it for greed sidney - and that 's pathetic . 
i could almost forgive you if what you did to steve came from jealousy and love ... 
i 'm not a man sidney i 'm - 
like you ? 
and i 'm sorry for you too sidney . you 're going down with the ship . 
i 'm sorry about steve not myself . i 'm even sorry for my brother .   to be so lonely without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she 's his only real family - 
but i do n't need an uncle sidney . 
i hope that j.j. really likes steve that it is n't an act . 
it 's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself not just because i 'm my brother 's sister . 
do you think j.j. likes steve ... ? 
who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops like a trained poodle ? 
yes but why ? 
not to me .   sometimes the world feels like a cage .   then someone comes along and opens the door ... and it 's never monday night again ...   i wish you and steve could like each other . 
you 're touchy sidney - do n't be so touchy ... 
you are saying goodbye are n't you ... ? 
steve i feel exhausted ... what do you want me to do ? 
but please steve please - one step at a time !   i was born only yesterday ! ... 
steve i ... 
i just did n't think that i could antagonize him steve -- for our sake i mean . 
no one 's ever stood up to my brother the way you did . 
steve ... what you tried to do today ... you tried to take me up on a high mountain ... i could n't go all the way ... i failed you ...   will you forgive me ?   have i lost you steve ?   have i ... ? 
would you buy me a cup of coffee ? in there ... 
hello steve .   i 'm glad you could come . 
steve stop it please ... 
i made you write a beautiful song ... 
and on tuesday - hasenpfeffer . steve   how do you think i realized i love you ? 
if the stores are open - 
steve dear please forget all of this .   what can it matter after tomorrow ? 
darling i do n't care - really i do n't .   sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years but nothing we do is his business - 
steve my brother is n't as bad as he 's painted .   he is n't perfect but - 
i 'm telling him in the morning after breakfast . 
steve i 'd rather you did n't say anything for a day or two ... until i tell my brother ... 
- that 's what i mean ! 
what would you think of me if - 
a girl needs a little romancing before she - 
this sort of thing ! 
sidney ... i ... i do n't do this sort of thing ... 
do n't you think i have any feelings ? what am i ?   a bowl of fruit ?   a tangerine that peels in a minute ? 
what do you want all of a sudden - lady godiva ... ?   where 's my other shoe ? 
and he 's a perfect stranger to me . 
yeah .   otis elwell .   the columnist . 
do you still keep your key under the mat ? 
do you think you could do something sidney ? 
but sidney darling the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning ! 
i do n't know - it 's a big apartment . but i was n't interviewed .   in fact i was totally unprepared for what happened . 
in his apartment - 
... cigarette girls ... and naturally - 
staring .   consequently when he approached me on his way out i was n't surprised but i did n't let on . 
no .   that 's what i mean - i 'm being fired for what i did n't do . 
at the bar - sidney ... 
sidney can i talk to you a minute ? 
i do n't think so . 
do n't you ever get messages eyelashes ?   i called you twice . 
if you want me to - 
or what you see in me for that matter ... 
i swear sidney i ca n't help it - sometimes i wonder what i see in you ... 
i know you do sidney . 
take a top coat . 
i 'm used to you ... 
sid ... you got me so ... i do n't know what ... 
sidney please dear if you feel nervous ... 
sidney i know you by now .   do n't do a dance with me ... 
i hate to see you like this -- 
i wish i could help in some way sidney . 
it wo n't leave much of a balance in the bank ...   mr. robard ?   could you locate him ? 
the renting agent and the tailor . 
that makes five days in a row that mr. hunsecker 's cut you out of his column . 
no an arm he said .   i told him you were sure the item would be in mr. hunsecker 's column in tomorrow 's ... 
that 's the third time he 's called today . 
no ! ! we 're going all the way !   you got that dyson ? 
those lying motherfuckers !

go !   i 'll finish here . 
yeah .   right .   how were you supposed to know ? fucking men ... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your ... fucking ideas and your weapons .   did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man ?   colt browning smith thompson kalashnikov ... all men .   men built the hydrogen bomb not women ... men like you thought it up .   you 're so creative .   you do n't know what it 's like to really create something ... to create a life .   to feel it growing inside you .   all you know how to create is death ... you fucking bastards . 
i love you john .   i always have . 
i could n't ... oh god .   you ... came here ... to stop me ? 
i need to know how skynet get built .   who 's responsible ?

we 're better off by ourselves .

out of the way john ! 
kyle do n't go ! 
i know but i 'm not as strong as i 'm supposed to be .   i ca n't do it .   i 'm screwing up the mission .

there 's 215 bones in the human body motherfucker . that 's one .   now do n't move ! 
so what do you think doctor ?   i 've shown a lot of improvement have n't i ? 
if i had there would have been some evidence . they would have found something at the factory . 
you said i could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if i showed improvement in six months .   well it 's been six months and i was looking forward to seeing my son . 
it has helped me a lot to have a goal something to look forward to . 
are you afraid ?

is it safe for them here ? 
can you get us in there past security ? 
son of a bitch i knew it ! 
i want to know everything .   what he looks like . where he lives .   everything . 
jesus .   how much do you know about dyson ?

does n't want you thinking too much huh ? 
i 'll bet . makes you a more efficient killer right ? 
you look like handmade shit . 
can it be destroyed ? 
this t-1000 ... what happens when you shoot it ? 
' please remember that dr. furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him . i personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help . he never turned anyone away . after he heard me play ... i am a violinist ... he gave me money because i was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to sweden . he helped countless people in similar ways . ' 
i do n't know . but you and i already know that he has saved lives . 
when he made his decision he could n't have known everything . especially not the way people like you do who 've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement . because you are blameless you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness . but you have no idea how people lived here . 
do n't see me to my door there 's no need . 
what does he mean too correct ? 
and talking is talking ! well i think we better get on . 
and no elbows on the table ! 
oh ! and do n't wave your hands about ! 
that 's because you had a proper upbringing . 
i would like to go now please . 
but he had no idea a lot of people had no idea . i only realised what was really going on when i got arrested . 
i have been questioned by the gestapo just like that . just like you questioned him . 
i ca n't do this . it 's not right . 
i 'm sorry but i have to leave . i 'll find other work . you 'll have to get someone else that 's all . 
of course . 
bruckner 's seventh major .

i 'm sorry .

i want it to be over for me too . i feel like i slipped over some invisible line that i 'm in your world now .   everything 's the same but i see it differently . it 's like there 's you and me and him ... but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us . 
i want it to be over for you . 
i want to buy you a hot dog so badkyle ... all the things you 've never seen and done .   you 're here but wherever you go and whatever you touch you bring the war with you .

i think i would remember .   what makes you think it 's me ? 
where 'd you get this ? 
what is it ? 
did n't think i 'd ever see you again . 
it 's okay dad . 
what are you doing here ? 
they said five hundred .   i said six . they said the man in the gray flannel suit .   i think i said you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit ? 
i have a confession to make .   someone gave me six - hundred dollars to spill drinks on you as a practical joke . 
give me an address so i can send your shirt back . 
right .   call me christy . 
i do n't think i 've ever spent this much time with someone who did n't even ask my name . 
do n't .   it was a shitty job anyway . i overreacted . 
if this was my office i would n't keep that closed . 
what exactly do you do ? 
where are we going ? 
we hang down here and drop .   the garbage'll break our fall . 
that 's classic . 
nicholas van orton ?   what are you a czar ? 
never did catch your name . 
... two hundred dollars a toe . 
your < u > shoes</u > cost a thousand dollars ? 
me ?   you 're the one who ... !   shit ! 
you 're a grown man .   i 'm not responsible for you . 
they 'll love that . 
what 's c.r.s. ? 
i 'll wait . 
my hero .   let 's go . 
i 'm not wearing underwear .   okay ? there i said it .   satisfied . 
you pull me up . 
you first . 
are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us ? 
if there was one . 
why not ? 
never mind . 
how thoughtful .   the gift of inconvenience . 
where 'd you all go ?   motherfucking frat boys .   you better hide .   is your life so pathetic that this is something you 're willing to pay for ? 
see you around . 
there 's got to be a flashlight . 
you should be . 
you mean the guy who turned blue and < u > wet</u > himself ... ? 
what are you talking about ? 
a game ? 
what ... is ... happening ... ? 
let 's talk to whoever can get this over with ... 
what < u > is</u > your problem ? 
he 's turning blue ! 
he 's pissing his pants .   is that real enough for you ?   call 911 ! 
do n't just stand there get help ! 
do you know what to do ? 
what 's with him ? 
do n't explain .   fuck off .   goodbye . 
what 's going on ?   i 'm going on my second job this month and now i 'm going on unemployment . 
what are you babbling about psycho ? 
oh no ... you . 
i said i was sorry ... 
it was an accident . 
i apologize sir i 'm having a bad day ... 
i 'm so sorry . 
goodnight .   see you home . 
nobody worried about your father . 
you 're not like him at all .   i do n't know exactly what 's going on around here lately but do n't make me start worrying about you . 
not much i think . 
no .   what happened ... no one expected it . 
your mother thought he was a good man .   he worked very hard .   what i remember most was his manner was so ... slight .   it was easy to spend time in a room and not realize he 'd been there the whole time . 
all the time i 've known you you 've never once asked about him . 
what makes you ask ? 
i do n't know what you 're talking about .   what 's happened ? 
yes . what do you mean ?   what 's wrong ? 
mr. van orton ... ? 
goodnight then . 
i 've finished for the evening .   will you be needing anything else ? 
is everything alright ? 
well ... send my love if you see him again . 
you did ?   how is he ? 
dinner 's in the oven . 
have a nice day . 
is this true ?   i 've been hypnotized ? 
welcome home eleanor .   welcome home ?   i 've never been here .   who did this ? 
could n't get the last ones .   you ? 
the children .   the children hugh crain built the house for .   the children he never had . 
i only saw theo drive up . 
well i ... uh ... 
uh ... nell vance ... 
nothing if you leave right now . there 's a war going on all around us .   do n't get in the way please . 
my mother used to hum this to me . like her mother hummed it to her . and my great grandmother carolyn hummed it to her . 
then who called me ? 
but you told me to look in the paper !   you told me i 'd be perfect ! 
the children want me .   they 're calling me .   they need me . 
because that 's where he burned them up the child laborers from his mills !   because that 's where their bones are !   he killed < i > hundreds</i > .   he took them here and he killed them .   their bones are in the fireplace ! 
it 's not real ?   crain ?   he 's not real ? 
and they 're all locked together in here ... and he wo n't let go of them ! 
i do n't know .   a lullaby i guess . my mother used to hum it to me . and her mother before that and so on .   hugh crain would you care to dance ? 
it does n't matter .   even if they 're tormenting me someone wants me .   what i do with this is up to me .   i can be a victim or i can be a volunteer .   and i want to be the volunteer . 
welcome home . 
it was a stupid thing to do . 
let 's say it was n't you .   who did it ? 
are you coming to confess ? 
i 'm sorry .   i 'm messing up the study . 
i got more scared . 
i looked at theo .   she had a look on her face . 
i was n't thinking about my mother 's bathroom . 
in the bathroom in my mother 's room the toilet was next to an old wooden table .   it smelled like that wood . 
it was very specific . 
that smell ... oh god . 
theo i think .   you 've asked us that three times doctor marrow . what 's going on ? 
all the carvings . 
yes because someone was always keeping me awake .   ever since i was little .   that was my job .   i took care of my mother and i had to be there for her all night long and she woke up all the time .   and after she died well it 's been a few months but i still i still wake up it 's ... a habit .   i know we 've only known each other a couple of hours but i 'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this .   i 'm really happy to be here with you . 
i 'm really ... honored to be part of this study jim . 
you can call me nell dr. marrow . 
is there something about the house ? 
why do you need a chain like that ? 
i 'm with dr. marrow 's group .   i 'm supposed to check in with mrs. dudley up at the house .   is she here ? 
are you mister dudley the caretaker ? 
oh !   you scared me . 
no one will come any nearer than that . 
why would we -- 
well i 've never lived with beauty .   you must love working here . 
they 're so beautiful .   are n't they ? 
mrs. dudley . 
oh theo .   you know i do n't have an apartment . 
just had to be sure . 
they 're all in here .   all the ones he killed .   they 're just children ! we have to help them ! 
i do n't think i want any . 
-- but the painting ! 
this is real i 'm not making it up !   theo you saw it !   you were there -- the banging and last night .   you you all saw the painting ! 
carolyn showed me where she hid him hid him with all the ones he killed -- 
because i do n't want to ruin things .   because home is where the heart is . 
-- what do you think ? 
i think so . 
i 'm trying .   have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it 'd ruin things . 
i do n't know you know ... 
i 'll take that as a compliment .   in the city what kind of place do you live in ? 
i 'm sorry i was mad at you theo . 
red .   what else ? 
i 've never had a pedicure before . 
i do n't know what to think anymore . 
there 's hundreds of them .   this must be a record of the children who died at the mills like luke said . 
theo ... did you ? 
no it 's getting worse . 
david ?   david watts ?   can you hear us ?   david !   daviiiiid ! 
what 's his first name ? 
how could he have left without his keys ? 
yes .   i feel realy rested too . theo ? 
you know it was n't a joke theo . 
good night theo . 
yes .   i 've missed it . 
a monster ?   but he built this for the woman he loved like the taj mahal . 
i love this house .   i really love this house . 
i know . 
i do n't have anyone .   but i do have a little apartment of my own .   it has a little flower garden .   you can just see the ocean .   at night when the wind comes in just right you can hear the buoys in the harbor . 
ohh sure you have trouble with commitment . 
not really . 
i 'm between jobs right now .   my last job ... it ... the person i was working for ... the job ended . over .   so ... and you ? 
that 's why we 're here . 
i do n't know what you mean . 
it 's all i could afford . 
fifteen dollars . 
this ?   it 's from a thrift shop . 
was sure she 'd be in here . 
will the two of you shut up !   god damn it !   maybe the tests were right marrow .   she 's sensitive she 's vulnerable but i do n't think she 's suicidal and i did n't have to test her .   maybe she was n't trying to kill herself . maybe she was really scared . maybe she really heard voices . 
maybe someday . 
that depends on your definition of ghosts .   i 'm going to check on her and then i 'm going to stay awake . 
we 're fucked .   we 're in a haunted house and we ca n't get out until the morning . 
mister very talky would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you ? 
you could have . 
he must have left .   did n't like the looks of the place or something . 
and why did n't marrow tell < u > us</u > ? does n't he trust women ?   that fuck . 
the rest of you may hate your insomnia but i find it the best time of the day for me .   i 'm alone .   nobody 's talking to me but myself .   my mind is racing with ideas and i can think . 
but the experiment was a failure . 
i 'm not going back to new york city .   i 'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden where you can just see the ocean and at night when the wind comes in just right you can hear the sound of the harbor .   what about you ? 
oh god we ca n't get out ! 
he 's wandering around the house and nell heard him .   she thought it was ghosts .   let 's go look for him again . 
she needs help . 
yes .   but i promised i would n't let her alone the whole night . 
how could you do this to people ? 
it 's okay ... we 're all here ... 
maybe they 're mary 's . 
well this is a cozy breakfast . 
when do we take the tests ? 
no but nell 's been here longer than i have . 
then let 's go get you one . 
what 'd you come back for babe ? 
come on !   why are we waiting ? 
i do . 
i 'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep .   and then i 'm going to get some brandy . 
nell it makes sense .   it all makes sense .   you and i we were scaring each other working each other up . 
nell what happened ? 
then who is ?   come on nell .   deep down if you really thought it was n't jim why would n't you be leaving right this second ?   why would n't you be afraid ?   really afraid . 
marrow said the same thing as last night he < u > says</u > --   -- that he checked with mrs. dudley .   and he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the west wing connect to the main chimney .   he says that he thinks that the flue was open and with the windstorm he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current -- 
are you sure ? 
my place is n't like yours nell it does n't have a view of sea .   it does n't have a view of anything . what 's interesting about the way i live is what goes on inside the walls .   living with me ... my boundaries are n't very well defined nell .   do you know what i mean ? 
you want to move to new york you want to move in with me ? 
i have a loft . 
me too .   although i learned one thing about you that you do n't know about yourself .   you can be a pretty decent bitch . 
just think about one thing right now : what color ? 
well it was n't me .   mister dudley had to clean it and he knows that he 's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and ...   you said the good doctor was with you . 
before he painted your name over mister crain . 
that 's so sad . 
i do n't know .   you 've been alone for a long time maybe you want attention .   maybe he did it ... 
maybe you did it yourself . 
is it over ? 
maybe he never came in .   if he 'd come in he would have left his bags at the door right ?   or maybe he got here early and went for a walk and fell .   maybe he 's outside . 
two sets .   i do n't know .   maybe they 're not even his . 
i guess .   oh your hair !   it looks good . 
if this was some sort of joke i 'm going to kill him . 
you too .   happy tossing and turning . 
no .   the world has missed you . 
you 've been out of the world for a long time have n't you ? 
the taj mahal was n't a palace it was a tomb .   why did n't he tell us ? 
you 're okay . 
a blank canvas !   i could paint your portrait directly on you . or maybe not .   so you ?   husbands ? boyfriends ?   girlfriends ?   where do you live ? 
my boyfriend thinks so my girlfriend does n't .   if we could all live together ... but ... they hate each other .   it 's hard to be miss perversity when you 're the only one at the party .   d'you know what i mean ? 
do n't tell me boston is different from new york . 
that depends . 
what do you do ? 
do n't worry i probably wo n't be in here much .   light sleeper . 
wait .   you 're not wearing that ironically ?   this is really you ? 
that 'd be seventy in new york . you stole it ! 
what did it cost ? 
and what you 're wearing that 's great too . 
why not ? 
we think ? 
just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time . 
nothing .   i guess it 's hard to pass on this road . 
i 've lived in l.a. all my life i 've never done this drive . 
hey i thought you were n't a buffet person . 
it must 've been a time .   a golden moment . 
i like the colors . 
not who food .   should we get italian . 
oh god . 
for some eating is a sensual experience . < u > the</u > sensual experience . 
you demand to be served .   a fork fetishist . 
like you . 
what kind of food ? 
it 's an observation .   like :   i 'm hungry . when are we eating ? 
it 's not a knock . 
no .   you 're not specific enough to be a person .   you 're more like a vibe . 
well you 're certainly not a person . 
i 'm loyal to things that make me happy . 
is that a problem ? 
then what good is he ? 
i < u > want</u > to know why you < u > need</u > that scary guy in your house . 
i used to hate it .   now i like it . 
i 'd rather be with him than without him . i do n't want to be found dead in l.a. 
hard to miss . 
no but i know what he means . 
you just cooking then ? 
well those are the breaks . 
uh - huh . 
not much -- you ? 
you 're just on a higher plane wilson . 
poor baby . 
friends and < u > colleagues</u > . 
how do you know ? 
what 's in big sur ? 
i could use a vacation .   of course i keep forgetting for you this < u > is</u > a vacation . 
i do n't know -- few hours i guess . 
up the coast . 
she never would have turned you in not in a million years . 
still you could never ... do what she wanted . 
she told me you were a ghost in her life . daddy the friendly ghost .   coming back to haunt her . 
a leech on the welfare state in addition . you do n't miss a trick . 
minor officials bother you do n't they ? 
wo n't he be looking for you about now ? 
i guess you 're just habitual . 
what 'd your father do ? 
he alive to see this ? 
what about your grandmother ? 
stick with me kid .   looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes . 
yeah well you 're here now --   -- where < u > h</u > urricanes < u > h</u > ardly ever < u > h</u > appen . 
only in the movies . 
-- they want southern i do southern they want midwest i do midwest they want tall blonde and twenty - two i 'm shit out of luck .   one thing i ca n't do is english . americans ca n't .   should n't even try . and laurence olivier could n't do us . 
pushing the legal limit even then . 
i do n't believe it . 
you < u > have</u > been away .   or is all this just new to you ? 
overnight .   what about just now ? 
who remembers . 
i was inside once .   i punched a cop at a demo . 
from pursuing your chosen profession . 
it did n't discourage you though . 
you mean if they 'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess . 
what did you do ?   to make them take the early 70 's away from you . 
still there have been rewards .   it 's sunny .   and some of the producers who call even have credits . 
it 's too involved ; a lifetime of non- involvement .   anywhere else i 'd be an interesting little number here i 'm just sag number forty - eight thousand and one .   sag meaning screen actor 's guild . 
you do n't know how i 've compromised my standards . 
these more highlights from the zagat prison guide ? 
you think terry gave me access to her things ?   probably sold her clothes . 
she 'd never called me like that before . she sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid .   but she never turned up .   i called the house but only got the answer machine .   when they found her ... she 'd been going the wrong way . not the direction she 'd have gone if she 'd been coming to see me .   or coming < u > straight</u > to see me .   who knows .   maybe she just wanted to drive . 
jenny was supposed to come to my place that night .   she called me asked if she could come over .   she and terry had been -- having some trouble .   lately .   i do n't know about what .   on this occasion it reached some sort of crisis point . 
there 's the phone .   you want his number . 
on what .   what makes you so certain . 
terry 's never going to give you satisfaction .   not the type . 
you do n't believe it was a car accident . 
you fuckin ' guys and your dicks . 
are you serious . 
so what 's the deal .   you and terry valentine at twenty paces .   is that what this is about . 
-- when he wants someone run down you 're willing to do it for him . 
in what capacity are you employed by this mr. lindgren ? 
i thought you said you never did an honest day 's work in your life . 
i bet . 
i see . 
what line is he in . 
who 's mr. lindgren ? 
-- your employer ? 
lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing .   like me -- but on a grander scale of failure . 
do you even know who terry valentine is ? 
that 's what was estimated . 
where you get your bank statements . 
what 's that like a p.o. box . 
the address jenny gave me that was n't a prison was it ? 
were you still married at the time -- to jenny 's mother i mean ? 
i gave him yours .   said here you want to write i think this is a relative .   i guess i thought i was being true to jenny .   who told me she did n't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why . 
i should really give him a call .   he 's a character is n't he .   well not to you . i meant to us squares in the outside world . 
and you 've seen eddie rama . 
i might 've been away for the weekend . 
you have n't been lurking outside my building all day . 
when did you get in ? 
she was happy here .   however the two of you might have parted .   do n't think she was n't . 
she was twenty - one when she came to me .   ... straight from leaving you . 
you were n't disappointed in her then . 
when i 'm not honing my craft in episodic television i do double - duty as a voice coach .   not that her accent would have hobbled her progress .   not with that look . 
she never told anyone else .   about the convict strain -- or is it stain ?   no i was privileged .   i was someone who helped jenny efface her past . 
not ashamed . 
not embarrassed . 
i 'm sorry .   i guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went .   it must 've been the bars . 
now who 's being sarcastic ? 
three seasons .   they found that 's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of mormons on the chisum trail .   i was wife number three -- the ingenue . 
if it played in england somebody owes me money .   who told you that -- eddie ? 
sarcastic moi ?   maybe i 'll mellow when my ship comes in .   it 's expected any day now .   i 'm all packed and ready to go . 
sounds like beverly hills . 
try calling me again . 
well that kind of security ca n't be bought .   must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you . 
and not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out .   from the wembley staduim job was n't it ?   pink floyd concert receipts .   jenny would 've been ... fourteen at the time ? 
in any case i do n't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel . 
that 's not what i heard . 
it 's been a while . 
been busy have you . 
no why did you come here ? 
why did you come here ? 
not her brand . 
you look alike . 
please mr crane it 's ok please-- 
it 's ok ... 
... i wanted to make you happy . 
but i do appreciate it mr crane ... 
you 're an enthusiast . 
i 'm only sorry that i did n't play better for you . i know it would 've made you happy . you know what you are ? 
i do appreciate the interest you 've taken though . 
... i 'm not certain i 'll have a career at all and if i do i 'll probably be a veterinarian . 
but it does n't matter . really i 'm not interested in playing music professionally . 
it does n't matter mr crane . 
but more or less . 
... i stank did n't i ? 
geez mr crane . 
geez mr crane i do n't know . i had n't really thought about a career or stuff . 
oh mr crane-- 
well sure i guess . pop says so too . i work pretty hard at school . 
that 's what he keeps telling me . 
pop does n't like people smoking in here . 
we 've certainly missed you . 
we have n't seen you since ... i 'm terribly sorry . 
hello mr crane . 
oh in there ? i messed up a little bit in the scherzo . i guess if nobody noticed it 's ok . mr crane this is tony a friend of mine . tony mr crane . 
hi mr crane . 
beethoven . he created it and yet he never actually heard it . i suppose he heard it all in his head somehow . 
he was deaf when he wrote this . 
i 'm so sorry ... i was sorry to hear . 
it 's ok i guess . no i do n't really . i 'm not big on music ordinarily . 
nah do n't say anything . i 'm alright . 
i knew we 'd pay for it . 
... my books used to be perfect . anyone could open them up make sense of the whole goddamn store . 
should i ... should i tell you why ? 
i know all about that . but i do n't know how much to tell them . 
i helped him cook the books ed . i did do that . 
... i do n't know what happened to big dave . i know some of it . irregularities in my books they said . can i explain it . 
i do n't know what 's going on . i-- 
it 's just a goddamn bowl of cherries i 'm sure . 
life is so goddamn wonderful you almost wo n't believe it . 
' gratulations gina . it 's so goddamn wonderful . 
... what 's so damn strange about that ? 
* that means i do n't run nirdlinger 's ! * 
... money problems . he 's thinking about canceling the annex . 
... what a knucklehead . 
oh do n't be a grump . 
come on get ready . it 's important . 
me ? us ! the party at nirdlinger's -- i told you last week for the christmas push . 
dr. frock ? 
we will . 
no dr. frock .   you ca n't . 
that thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes . 
none of that matters now .   the people upstairs need us .   we have to help . 
what 's that ? 
dr. frock .   did you hear that ? 
i think so . 
what 's going on ? 
and it 's hungry .   it 's been two days since it 's eaten .   there are five hundred people arriving right now . the animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell !   all those people in one enclosed space ... 
with the intelligence of a human being the speed of a greyhound and the strength of a grizzly bear . 
look at this .   an ambyloid reovirus protein .   that explains why the computer 's confused .   the plant 's infected with a virus . 
several problems with that theory . for one thing this egg is intact . for another according to pendergast the crates were shipped here on a boat .   everyone on board was killed like beauregard .   if the thing hatched in mid - ocean where did it go ? 
let 's not jump to conclusions .   this egg could belong to any number of reptiles dr. frock . 
what are they ? 
whatever it is it must be common on the tepui .   john used it as packing material . 
what is it ? 
a blow dart .   seed pods .   a plant press .   pretty unimpressive stuff . 
that cuthbert .   what a piece of work . someone 's dead and all he cares about is his superstition exhibit . 
you are this museum .   it wo n't be the same without you . 
i 'm not giving up . 
your work is highly relevant .   what about your display on primitive pharmacology ?   cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the superstition exhibit . 
my work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you . 
how can you say that ?   you know it 's not true . 
let me help .   i can take care of everything . 
we ca n't do without you .   you 're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology .   you 're practically an institution around here . 
i do n't believe it . 
fourth floor west wing but stay with your class . 
evolutionary biologist .   i study how life on earth evolved over millions of years . 
i 'm an evolutionary biologist .   what do you do ? 
yes i do . 
how about lunch ? 
yes he 's fine .   greg ... take care of yourself ! 
yes .   whatever killed beauregard may have lived on this plant .   when the crates were put in secure storage they were out of reach .   the killer could n't get them so it got the next best thing . 
pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim 's brains ! 
this is it .   this is what he or it ... is after !   the plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain ! 
try weinstein 's tropic hormone . 
what kind of hormones ? 
it 's reptilian . 
there 's another possibility .   a lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage . 
turkish gecko i believe .   a lizard . 
it 's not mammalian that 's for sure . i think it 's reptilian . 
for once i 'm glad you 're rumor central .   what in the world is going on ? 
that 's impossible . 
i have the species identification on these teeth .   we can extract dna and start running tests on the extrapolator program .   call dr. frock .   he wanted a demonstration . 
but at what a price . 
i 'm so glad to see you .   what 's the occasion ? 
i ca n't ! 
do it quickly .   please .   aim for the eye . 
just like john .   he wo n't listen . 
you have to !   listen !   all viruses pass on their own dna .   instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses !   this one was different .   it inserted a whole array of genes into john .   reptile genes sixty five million years old .   those genes remade him !   it 's not his fault ! 
that thing is john whittlesley .   i should have seen it before !   the fibers are infected with a virus . you eat them and the virus alters your dna !   he became addicted to them in south america followed the plants back to the states .   he probably entered the country as a man .   it would have taken several months for the change to take place . that 's how he got from the boat to the museum ! 
no !   do n't kill him !   pendergast you were right .   it 's john ! 
listen to me pendergast .   mbwun 's dna is part homo sapien .   in primates the eye is a direct path to the brain !   if you get a clean shot there 's only one place you can kill it .   shoot it in the eye ! 
you smell that ? 
help someone ! 
that 's a ptarmigan feigning a broken wing .   the bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest ! 
the answer 's right in front of us . 
we have to try and draw it off ! 
i think ... for the pleasure of the kill . 
no .   it 's still hunting but not for the hormones . 
i think ... it means it 's full . 
its eyesight is worse than i thought .   it could n't see us .   and it could n't smell us through the glass . 
what is it doing ? 
what are you going to do ? 
is there another way around ? 
the planetarium ! 
unlock one of the other storage rooms .   we 're going upstairs .   we 'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here . 
we have the fibers .   do n't you see ? the creature is hungry .   it wants the hormones in these plants .   it would take hundreds of human brains to supply what 's in these fibers .   we 're just a poor substitute .   to make it stop hunting we have to give it what it wants . 
it 's not supernatural .   mbwun is an animal .   part lizard part human a genetic freak of some kind like the half - goat half - sheep they found last year in the jungles of vietnam . 
that would fit .   it 's nocturnal . quick .   come inside . 
you 're not .   where is it ? 
pendergast ?   are you all right ? 
when dna is defective it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair .   viruses can damage dna .   so can radiation certain chemicals .   even cancer .   let 's let the g.s.e. sort it out .   i have to get started .   this will take several hours . 
i do n't know .   mr. pendergast .   do me a favor .   get me a dna readout on that claw . 
all right .   this is hard for me .   i 'm a scientist .   i like order and logic . sometimes too much .   there 's got to be an explanation .   there ca n't be an animal in there .   but i saw something . 
i did n't imagine it .   i know what i saw .   are you sure there are enough men in there ? 
that 's not what i saw . 
behind me .   over there . 
it 's okay i 'm all right .   i remember now ... it was an animal .   something large !   i could smell it .   it was hunting me .   i saw two green eyes in the dark . 
you were behind me ?   running after me ? 
i do n't know . 
i 'm not sure .   we should split up . you take that hall and i 'll take this one . 
i do n't know .   he sent back a statue that 's supposed to be an exact representation .   but i 've never seen it .   it 's in the exhibit . 
my god .   then it was an animal . 
i do n't understand . 
no .   i 'm all right .   i wo n't let this affect me anymore .   john would n't get help .   his ego endangered the lives of others .   his theory came first . 
no one knows .   the kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals . 
a legendary monster called mbwun . 
he was afraid of himself .   he tried suicide once .   he was ill .   manic depressive .   he had wild emotional highs and lows .   not a happy affliction for a scientist .   he 'd been revered in our community .   by the end he was a joke . 
that was two years ago .   john was still in love with me .   he would n't leave me alone . 
how did you know that ? 
yes .   once .   we met at columbia .   john held the cadwalader chair in statistical paleontology when i was a grad student there . 
john could n't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that .   he was a fine man despite his problems -- 
i do n't understand . 
and john ? 
if he were alive he 'd have contacted me . 
somehow when all this happened ... i knew it would come back to john .   is he really dead ? 
with a dna analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal whether it was nocturnal what it ate how it hunted how big it was ...   you are n't here for a lesson in dna . 
an invention of mine .   it 's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its dna .   i call it the genetic sequence extrapolator . 
--truman you 're gon na be late ! 
truman stop it ! 
you 're the one talking to the walls ! 
do something ... 
you 're having a nervous breakdown that 's what 's happening . 
i 've tasted other cocoas .   this is the best . 
why do n't i make you some of this new mococoa drink ?   all natural .   cocoa beans from the upper slopes of mount nicaragua . no artificial sweeteners-- 
that 's not true . 
let me get you some help truman .   you 're not well . 
so we just eat into our savings is that the idea ?   i 'd better call your mother when we get there .   she 'll be worried sick - i do n't know how she 's going to take this . 
so what do we do for money when we get to new orleans ? 
truman what about that sign ? 
there 's been an accident truman . 
let me out truman .   you 're not right in the head .   you want to destroy yourself you do it on your own ! 
truman that was our house ! 
you blaming me for the traffic ? 
truman i think i 'm going to throw up . 
so why do you want to go ? 
you hate gambling . 
what ? ! 
you 're upset because you want to go to fiji .   is that it ? 
--we need more charcoal . 
i invited marlon and rita for a barbeque sunday .   i thought i 'd make my potato salad .   remind me-- 
put some butter on it -- or ice ? 
i do n't know-- 
oh my god ! 
surgery .   the elevator disaster downtown on the news last night .   cable snapped a car dropped ten floors .   non - union contractors .   monsters .   we 're starting with an amputation . 
i 'm sorry i 'm late . 
see you in a minute sweetheart . 
i 'll take you home angela .   why do n't you leave those with us for a while ? 
come on truman .   have n't you studied enough ? 
i made macaroni . 
your mother called .   you should n't upset her like that . 
i know . 
what 're you doing down here ? 
this 'll pass .   everybody thinks like this now and then .   come to bed . 
i thought we were going to try for a baby .   is n't that enough of an adventure ? 
we 're mortgaged to the eyeballs truman . there 's the car payments .   are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations ? 
and then what truman ?   we 'd be back to where we were five years ago .   you 're talking like a teenager . 
every time you and marlon-- 
oh god . 
where have you been ? 
did something happen today ? 
i was hoping we could have a special evening . 
a man tripped and fell on a chainsaw .   we got three of his fingers back on . 
well what do you think ? 
it 's a surprise . 
truman you 're gon na be late ! 
well we 're fbi agents . 
i think you better tell us . 
you 're not supposed to talk about it ? who told you that ? 
do you live around here ? 
almost .   mocky - lock showed up . 
a pocketful of rye ... 
no .   thank you . 
thank you . 
they 're hungry . 
it does n't matter ... 
he 's mine ? 
i told you .   you have to be optimistic . believe in them ... 
good for them . 
i heard julia and john got married . 
absolutely .   abigail ... 
give her a minute .   hello valentine . 
i ca n't leave him ! 
carl do you know ?   like on a map ... 
he brought you to me did n't he ?   if you want julia to live trust me .   trust him . 
he wants us to follow .   the little boy ... 
okay okay ... 
you 're sure of that ? 
tell me . 
what happened ? 
what happened to charles gish ? 
if you believe that . 
then what is he ? 
do n't you feel there are different sides to every personality ?   maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act .   we 're all human . 
not stargher not really .   he 's split himself right down the middle . good / evil right / wrong merciful / cruel . a monster .   and an innocent child .   if i could reach the boy . 
he might tell me about julia .   the part of him that wants to help that feels shame and remorse .   who wants to be redeemed . 
this is going to sound terrible but ... i do n't think she matters anymore .   not to him .   he never finished her .   the others ... he was able to make them his . 
you were right .   there 's a part of him that knows the truth .   about what he did about himself . 
you thought stargher wanted to be caught . 
as soon as i met him you knew i 'd say yes .   he makes julia real for me . 
why 'd you bring him here ? 
a kingdom .   his utopia . life without consequence or restriction . he 's not even carl stargher anymore . he 's this ... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases ... without fear .   a horrible primitive ugly thing .   i do n't want to talk in here . 
with stargher i saw things ... 
just like we all have fantasies right ? things only we know that we do n't share . 
do you feel there 's a side of yourself you do n't show people ? 
agent novak ? 
the soul .   the spirit .   whatever you want to call it . 
it does n't have much to do with science . 
do you think that 's funny ? 
you do n't know the procedure . 
i realize that ... 
okay .   let 's assume he wanted you to find him that some part of him hated what he was doing ... most likely that part is dead .   schizophrenics with whalen 's infraction sever all ties with the real world .   i 'm sorry i really am . 
really ?   i do n't work with violent cases i work with children .   but even a kid lies .   they love it when they get you to believe something that is n't true .   do n't you think stargher would do the same ? 
i bet we can fix it . 
oh no ... no you do n't . 
who says ? 
what now ? 
he 's beautiful ... 
did we go sailing ? 
four - and - twenty blackbirds . 
sing a song of sixpence ... 
she 's bringing stargher into hers . 
what 's wrong ? 
i hate to admit it but there 's something perversely satisfying about this . 
pump in two liters of pure oxygen please henry . 
intravenous administration complete . 
they took care of that thank you henry . 
completely unaware . 
awaiting his arrival . 
that 's a secret . 
you 're looking well . 
agent novak . 
yes .   but you 're going to sit down right now .   i have to ... 
i doubt that . 
i know your partner 's here but it 's very important that you 're honest . 
what about narcotics ? 
any psychiatric medication ? 
i have to ask you some things ... are you taking any prescription drugs ? 
i have done this you know .   been inside . 
what about the legalities of this ... ? 
when did he lapse into the coma ? 
they think you did it . 
give her some cigarettes . 
ja ja ja . 
ich weiss nicht . 
from kurtz . they have just been arrested . but harry wo n't come he 's not a fool . 
if you want to sell your service i 'm not willing to be the price ... i loved him . you loved him . what good have we done him . look at yourself they have names for faces like that . 
why are you lying ? 
why should he help me like that ? the russians will only make trouble for him . 
there 's something wrong . did you tell calloway about meeting harry ? 
did he say anything about me - tell me ? 
how do you know ? 
what is going to happen ? where is harry ? 
i shall be all right . 
what is on your mind ? why did you hide ? 
i 'm sorry . 
have you been seeing major calloway again ? 
how did you know i would be here ? 
are you going too ? 
there is n't enough for two laughs . 
... and my lover . he was harry . 
i 'll put these flowers in water . 
he liked to laugh . 
he 's better dead . i know he was mixed up - but not like that . 
he told you did n't he ? 
have you ? 
have you seen calloway ? 
what happened to your hand ? 
i thought you were going to go away . are n't the police after you ? 
wer ist da ? 
be sensible - tell major calloway . 
what are you going to do ? 
let 's not get into any more trouble . 
let 's go away . 
i 'm so sorry . 
we 're both in it harry . 
i thought you wanted ... 
if we have to see the porter we 'd better go . 
it 's just what he used to say . 
... and buried him . 
tell me more . 
where is she ? 
when ... what did you do ? 
tell me about him . 
oh let me see . no no that 's not the cue . it means she has to sit down . 
what 's that ? 
well you read this . 
comedy . i do n't play tragedy . 
in german ? 
just another part i 've got to learn . 
need we go through it all again ? 
sssh . do n't . do n't please . 
yes . he moved his head but the rest is good is n't it ? 
dr. winkel . 
the russians would claim me . i come from czechoslovakia . 
they 're forged . 
the police . they 're searching my room . sie mussen doch wissen . 
why do n't you leave this town - go home ? 
you should n't get mixed up in this . 
i do n't know . they did n't answer . 
i know . i wondered about it a hundred times if it really was an accident . 
yes . they said it was n't the driver 's fault . harry often said what a careful driver he was . 
the doctor harry used to go to . he was passing just after it happened . 
dr. winkel told me that . 
that was the man that brought me some money when harry died . he said harry had been anxious at the last moment . 
oh yes yes . 
oh american thank you . i like them . 
i do n't know . how can you know a thing like that afterwards . i do n't know anything any more . 
i 'm so sorry i did n't notice much . 
no he never told me about his friends . would you like some tea ? 
do you understand german ? 
sit down . 
nichts danke . kein . 
thank you . 
of course . 
poor harry i wish he was dead he would be safe from all of you then . 
i do n't know . 
i 'm sorry - i do n't seem able to understand anything you say . he 's alive now this minute - he 's doing something . 
where 's harry ? 
what did you say ? i 'm sorry ... 
it 's true then ? 
two weeks ago . 
what can i tell you but that you have got everything upside down . 
it was n't important . 
i have never seen him . 
we loved each other do you mean that ? 
and my passport ? 
there 's nothing in them . 
you wo n't learn anything from them . they are only love letters . there are not many of them . 
they 're harry 's . 
must you take those letters ? calloway yes i 'm afraid so . 
good - bye . 
thank you you have been so kind . anna moves down to stand cl of paine . 
i do n't ... 
i do n't want it . 
they are - private - letters . 
must you take those ? 
you do n't own this place . 
miriam called looking for you . she said you might come so i ... 
look just light the candles with me . then we 'll eat . you have to eat . 
yeah okay . but what if ... what if ... submitting ... being crushed being nothing not mattering what if that 's the best feeling we can have ? 
he commands it whether he exists or not ...   look we can fight him and be crushed . or we can submit . 
no . what are you looking for ? 
i do n't know . i just want to try it . 
come on we can be like eichmann . he studied torah . he hated jews . 
lina come here ! 
i mean kiddush . let 's say kiddush . and shave my head fuck through a sheet all that stuff ...   come on just for fun . to see what it 's like ... 
okay ...   why do n't we light candles on friday ? let 's light candles .... and say the kaddish . 
'cause he was n't a rabbi . 
is that why you became a nazi ? so you could talk about jews incessantly ? 
do they ? 
it 's all you talk about . jewish jewish jewish . nobody talks about it that much except the jews . 
oh am i learning it faster than you did ? maybe i 'm smarter . 
i told you i 'm good at this . 
judaism does n't even need god . you have the torah the law . that 's your fucking god ....   the book 's closed . 
you think i should just because there 's no reason ? 
why should i submit ? 
fuck that . 
and belief follows ? 
what 's it about ? 
christianity 's silly but at least there 's something to believe in . or not believe . judaism there 's nothing . 
v'asitem lechem pessel to - monat . and make no graven image of the lord or the form of any figure or of man or woman or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything . because he 's not like anything . not only ca n't you see him or hear him you ca n't even think about him . i mean what 's the difference between that and him not existing ? 
payn tash - chiton v'ashiytem ... 
with you there 's a tragic dimension . 
the sex is better . 
where are they ? 
it looks a little like a swastika . 
who gets contaminated the jews or the gentiles ? 
what assholes . 
that 's stupid . 
why not ? 
i 'm good at languages . 
know your enemy .... 'cause it 's a basic text of western culture . i want to read it in the original . okay ? 
i want to learn to read it . 
what 's it mean ? 
oh yeah ... 
'cause i want to know .... what is this word ? this one here ... 
but you can read it the hebrew .... right ? 
do you know it like that ? by heart . 
how come there 's no punctuation ? 
where 'd you get this ? 
he 's at a home out here . 
you ca n't . 
i 'm talking to you right now . who 's linda ? 
who 's linda ? 
bigger and better . 
too many good players down here . i 'm with one right now . 
i bet . he did n't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one . 
you 're not like the others are you ? ... your friends . 
that 's stupid . why would they ? 
killing himself . 
i guess . his parents are . he does n't care about that . 
he 's in a mental institution .... he 's been there for ten years off and on . mostly on . 
they 're my father 's . he 's from argentina . my mother 's family went there during the war . that 's where they met . 
why no silencer ? 
where 'd you read all that stuff ? 
you 're not in school ? what do you do ? 
which is what ? 
disease ? what disease ? 
too christian . you know jameson ? paul virilio ? 
nobody reads that stuff anymore . 
you shut up . who do you think you are ? 
danny i 'm trying to -- save you . 
think about your father . your sister . 
and only talked about killing manzetti to convince them you were an anti - semite . if you 'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously you never would have said it . 
all right what if all along you were actually infiltrating the nazis -- to expose them .... 
so are you ... but they 'll believe you ....   lina moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea . that you proposed it in a meeting at her house .   ah jesus danny ... what were you thinking ? are you glad manzetti 's dead ? do you really want to kill jews ? you want to kill me ? 
it was a nine millimeter . 
you 're telling me you killed him ? you ? killed him ? bullshit . what kind of gun did you use ? 
which < i > times</i > guy ? 
i work in the da 's office . you go to those meetings half the people there are informants . 
tell me about lina moebius . 
this is me . 
you know the joke : a jew 's shipwrecked on a desert island . when they rescue him they see he 's built two synagogues . they say for vhat do you need two synagogues ? he says vun to pray in and vun i 'd never set foot in so long as i live so help me god .   you pray in the one you 'd never set foot in ... and vice versa . 
point out all the lies and fucked - up thinking . 
i thought you hated torah . 
why did you come tonight ? to see me ? 
the arguments anyway . 
not yet ... i 'm waiting for the right moment . 
bonita you should n't be discouraged so easily . 
of course . 
you 're leaving ? 
and you ... ?   do you love enzo ? 
probably not but i still do n't have the nerve to tell him . 
i ca n't ... i just do n't know how to ... 
... i 'm pregnant bonita ! 
yes .   not like enzo . 
... maybe if jacques will let me fix up the place a little . 
yes is n't it wonderful ?   i 'm so happy .   i 'll bet i 'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world ! 
no .   he 's french he was just in italy for the competition . 
will that interfere with my getting maternity leave ?   i 'm pregnant . 
remember when i went to italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium .   well we were n't being cheated by the mafia or anybody except maybe by me ...   ... do they come for lunch everyday ? i really went on my own business to see a man that i happen to be in love with ... and i 'm glad i did it but i 'm sorry about the policy and i 'll be happy to make up the money the company did n't get ... of course just now i do n't have ...   one million four hundred and ten thousand dollars .   but if you were to dock my salary say twenty dollars a week in a few hundred years we 'd be even ... and i think this is where you fire me ? 
i came to make a clean breast of everything ... the whole business . 
italian is practically the same thing . 
i tried him he ca n't go .   his son is being bar mitzvohed tomorrow ... i 'll go boss . 
we have to send somebody over there immediately !   if we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy . we 'll be off the hook .   there 's a flight to rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to sicily . 
yes !   the notary is a phony .   he has the same signature as the contractor ! 
the documents are forged . 
the mafia !   la cosa nostra ! 
listen i just found out we 've got real problems in sicily ! 
... so am i. 
like a popsicle .   they 're keeping him on a stick until spring . 
sorry .   of course not definitely not ... well maybe a little .   what did you say ? 
what kind ? 
is he alright ?   what happened ? 
five minutes and fifty seconds . 
... not yet . 
how do you know that ? 
he can learn .   he is learning . 
a little ... you think it 's the same for jacques ? 
i wo n't i swear . 
damn it !   why wo n't you give me a straight answer for once ? ! 
you know what i 'm talking about . 
enzo why do you guys do this ? 
what are you doing here ? 
is it a poem ? 
good night enzo good night jacques . 
the mamma 's there too . 
... it 's a comfortable place . 
well good night then ... 
enzo stop bitching will you ? 
congratulations enzo . 
... that 's what he 's here for is n't he ? 
and just where are you from ? 
i get it enzo you were a superior child . 
what was he like when he was little ? 
have you known him long ? 
you 'll be lovely but no thanks .   jacques would you do a native dance for me ? 
you forgot the hula ! 
in a lake . 
i think i 'll have a coffee . 
i wish but it 's full .   they recommended a pension in town . they say that all of taormina is full .   what 's going on here ? 
johana cross pleased to meet you .   well !   is n't this a coincidence . i really was n't expecting this ... all the way out here .   it 's incredible ! 
the guy in the halloween suit ! 
would it be out of place to ask what he 's doing ? 
... both .   did i just see a man in a red suit and goggles ? 
yes thank you .   intravenous if possible . 
does anybody live to make a second ? 
do n't you have a heater ? 
promise you wo n't forget me . 
promise me one thing . 
you are the father . 
jacques ?   i 'm pregnant . 
you 've got to tell me what happened ? 
... when you dive ... with that machine ... what does it feel like ? 
no i 'll be fine .   can you just hand me a glass of water ? 
it 's nothing .   just the long trip . i 'm a little jet - lagged . 
jacques ... ? 
what are you doing ? 
... nothing . 
you 'll try again tomorrow ? 
and you ? 
i 'm very pleased to meet you uncle louis . 
bonjour monsieur ... louis . 
why did you take me to the hotel if you live here . 
okay .   in that case ... i 'm at the airport in nice . 
you sure ? 
i 'm being a pain huh ? 
it 's me again . 
no ... tell me . 
then tell me a story . 
well then talk to me some more . 
so have i.   ... hello ? 
i got fired . 
it 's me ... johana . 
yes you do .   you know exactly what i 'm talking about .   you 're afraid i want to hold onto you and i do but you 're not ready ... at least not for me . 
because one should n't fall in love with creatures from the sea . 
i 'm going back home . 
are n't you happy ?   do n't you feel proud ... ?   i feel proud and all i did was watch . 
jacques you set a world record . 
can i come watch you dive tomorrow ? 
how do you know that ? 
how can you tell it 's a female ? 
no ?   huh ?   yes of course ! ! 
i 'd better get back now . 
just checking up on your family .   i guess i was drunker than i thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress ... well ... 
well water is n't exactly the best thing for pictures ... not even for pictures of dolphins ... 
only to help the medics i assure you . 
lucky i was there to save you . 
... especially the sneakers . 
you look adorable . 
i thought you 'd be at the dinner . 
i guess ... but you know ... i 'm american and i 've mostly been taught to be competitive ... there 's always pleasure of being the best ? 
just because ... i would have liked to visit the town ... see the coast ... i do n't know anybody ... expect for you . 
you 're going to be very busy these days are n't you ? 
i 'm being a pain in the ass .   it 's beautiful here . 
thanks for helping with the bag .   it looks great ! 
... okay .   i 'll try . 
i was doing an insurance investigation in palermo .   i work for an insurance company .   so i decided to take a few days off .   i do n't know this island at all . it really is gorgeous . 
thank you .   i would n't want to interrupt anything . 
no ... in the hut . 
we saw each other a little while ago . 
do you think i should have stayed ? do n't you think maybe i should have stayed ?   i 've been a jerk right ?   i should have stayed !   i was supposed to be in love ... i was in love !   i am in love why did i act like a bitch ?   he went swimming . all the man did was go swimming ! i must be crazy .   it was too good to be true . 
i know i know !   i 'm a terrible person ...   it 's ... i 'm so damn damn sad .

... and if we repaint the walls we 'll need new curtains you put the painters on you visa and i 'll do the curtains on american express ... for the couch there 's bloomingdales ...   or are you still over your limit ? 
... since eight o'clock last night ... !   you 're in love . 
i thought you said he was peruvian ? 
oh jesus ... !   i 'll make some coffee .   they left the stove .

how was your trip ? 
they 're going to send detectives . 
yep .   how was your trip ... ?   help me clean up okay ? 
... and the new stereo . 
they got the new t.v. 
you 're back !   hello .   we were burgled . 
i changed the lock you son of a bitch ! 
well for starters we 're going to honeymoon in boca for a week . and then when we get back morty 's been talking about taking a stable good paying job as a consultant for the jdl . 
what do you want me to do ? 
he's ... he 's very nice .   but mrs. carver the fate of hanukkah rests solely in his hands . please you have to help me . 
it 's esther . 
you two know each other ? 
i forgive you . 
mordechai i love you . i could n't let you do this alone . 
we do ! 
no . it 's not like that . you 're being completely neurotic . i was just playing along ... 
relax morty i think your mom is wonderful . she cares so much about you . get this while you were gone she said she 'd help me get you to work with the jdl if i 'd come eat by you once in awhile . like i needed any incentive to be with you . she 's so ... 
your mother was right . you do work too hard . 
kiss me you semitic stud ! 
keep going . 
i want you to talk dirty to me . 
maybe we should try a different kind of dancing . 
what ! ? 
i said do you come here often ! ? 
sure . why not . 
so now what ? 
yeah no kidding . 
what are we going to do ? we 're at least an hour from the front . 
any sign of santa ? 
i do n't think i could eat another latke if you paid me . 
mordechai santa claus has been rubbed out by his son damian . the man 's a demon . there 's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho santa is capable of . 
actually his days of marital infidelity have long since past . now he just shtoops my mother exclusively . 
my name is esther . chief bloomenbergensteinenthal from the jewish defense league desperately needs to speak with you . 
sorry i 'm late . traffic was a pisher and i 've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking . what are you listening to ? 
mr. jefferson carver ? 
hey  i 'm over here . 
i know . i know . you 've got the talent . i got the breaks . 
maybe . for three years i 've sung in rats ' nests while jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance . we 're due for a little luck ! 
why not ? he 's a good press agent and a good friend . besides we 've shared a lot of headaches  
yes . so i 've noticed . jerry 's noticed - he 'll come up with something . 
it may sound like music to her -- i can do better with my teeth in a cold shower .   click  click  click . 
no - really i can see them -- they 're coming now - turn off the lights  
i thought they came right past here  
i 've disturbed you . i 'm sorry - 
well i 'm next . you wo n't hear anything like that mr. galbraith .   i 'm not a popular favorite since i let the leopard loose . 
that was a calamity ! 
well i 'm hardly mrs. leslie carter whoever she was . in fact i 'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on jerry 's little publicity stunt with the leopard . 
why did you give up teaching ? 
what do you do now ? 
jerry told me you were an expert with animals mr. galbraith . could n't you tell where it went ? 
it 's a lovely town - it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened . 
jerry i want you to be soft . you are soft -- inside - where it matters . i wanted it that day too but did n't dare tell you . 
i hated you that day - you and your flip talk - with that little girl lying dead . 
we stood here once before . 
it 's all right . i 'm not hurt . 
we will  
how do you know ? 
all right i 'm not ashamed of it ! i split it two ways  
i -- i bought some silver jewelry and stuff from eloise -- 
as a matter of fact i 'm out of cash myself . 
that 's funny -- i never knew you to lose that much before -- 
did n't you take your cut out of the closing check ? 
you already know the answer to that . i want this town to be safe and happy again -- 
you 're positive of that are n't you ? 
confession . i 'm a complete softie . i 've been conscience - stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away -- 
maybe there ought to be less racket and more us . 
you . us . 
maybe i want to feel badly . 
and she waited here for him ? 
yes . do you mind ? 
jerry these flowers are n't really for me  
pretty . you know -- it 's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now . 
that was nice of mr. galbraith . 
i can use them . 
and not a sign of the leopard ? 
who is he ? 
our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience 
it must be the altitude  you bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootandsaddle boys -- 
and did you find the leopard ? 
well does everybody love us now ? you 've been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors ! 
what did he have to do - look at the body ? 
who was the other man ? 
and i suppose you do n't feel bad ! 
do n't be soft . 
now look what you 've done . 
the red dress ?   no . my black one . then i 'll be just like him . 
clo - clo ? 
no  not yet . 
this is l939 . ca n't you subtract ? 
you 're too good to me . 
on his back i suppose . 
that 's easy . me . 
makes no difference .   get him out . 
get it out of here ! 
no - not yet . 
you 're too good to me . 
on his back i suppose . 
that 's easy . me . 
makes no difference . get him out ! 
get it out of here ! 
i ... we have to bury leon tommorrow ... 
you wouldnt understand . 
i dont know . everyones dead ... 
on ... once ...   once ... what are we ... you going to do ? 
my parents flew back from israel ... told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce . he flew back to brazil ...   and his drowning was arranged ... 
the staff dont know yet ...   i called my parents told them everything ...   i just couldnt take any more ... 
they found his body yesterday . in the pool at our house in sao paulo . he drowned . drank too much went for a swim and drowned . 
no . not us ... 
do you think wed let him get away with the murder of my brother ? 
he ... he is dead !   my husband is dead !   call my parents . theyll tell you . call them ! 
what are you doing ? you cant . i ... 
perhaps i did ... until fear turned into panic . thats when he hit me and told me hed killed my brother ... you dont know what youve done he said .   were in deep trouble he said . we he said . we.   wed both be killed if friedman ever found out you were working for us he said . we had to stop you and friedman meeting ... 
i didnt intend it that way ... it just happened .   he heard from laurence that youd been back .   that wed argued . he asked why and it just happened ; i told him everything ... i couldnt help it . wanted to see him scared . i had never seen him scared before you see ... 
my husband didnt need to slap me about mr lombard . i volunteered ... 
you seem to know what youre talking about . 
should i ? 
simplify and damn . 
here we go again . 
something like that . 
something like that . 
i didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet mr lombard ! 
maybe i wanted to give my husband a fright . 
... were turning in circles . 
you splendid bastard ... 
you bastard ... 
why do i feel i neednt answer that ? 
think what you like . but dont presume to understand . 
i didnt know my husband and friedman knew each other . i just ...   do you think we spoke about it ? ive known for five years . hes known ive known for five years ... but not once have we spoken about it . there are things one just doesnt speak about ... 
that my brother my husband and your mr friedman were linked that much i had guessed . but that my husband had killed leon ? no . 
youre wrong about my being there though . carlos borrowed my car that day his had broken down ...   leon saw it like you assumed i was there thought hed wait to ask for a lift . but carlos turned up with the tape you found ...   leon got his lift and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out . he watched it confronted carlos threatened to tell the police about the hotel ... i dont know how he knew about the hotel . perhaps carlos talked too much ... my husband did not tell me ... you more or less guessed the rest ...   i didnt know any of this before you left for los angeles . 
leon could still have hung himself . 
if - if my car is there i could be the one who ... why dont you accuse me of killing my brother ? 
... you - you spoke to him ? 
leon hung himself ... 
leon hung himself ... 
leon hung himself . 
my brother hung himself . 
how ... when did you ... 
huh ! dont you recall convincing me he had ?   you should learn to live with your mistakes mr lombard . there is some merit in it . 
whatever the reason im sorry i did . goodbye mr lombard . i believe you know your way out . 
you do have a vivid imagination mr lombard . i only wish youd use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious . i fail to understand your purpose in this . still say what youre owed if you still wish to be paid or get out all right ? 
have you finished ? 
why ... i dont know what youre talking about . 
youre mad ... 
you ... you are out of order mr lombard . i ... 
i ... if you dont mind i do not think he matters now . it ... things turned out to be as we thought ; leon was weak . theres no point in delving into his sad life anymore . now will you please tell me how much we owe you ? 
i ... well were burying leon tomorrow and ... look i wish i had more time but its late and with the funeral ... 
im really sorry you were not called ... 
when did you get back ? 
mr lombard ... 
mr lombard . mrs de moraes ... 
paul lamont ... ? 
yes ... you woke me up ... its the middle of the night here . have you found mr friedman ? 
... 7548 . have you ... have you found him yet ? 
just a moment ...   go ahead . 
mr lombard ? 
you drive a hard bargain mr lombard . 
w - why are you telling me all this mr lombard ? 
huh ! really ? hotels ? 
are we understood ? 
im impressed . that information could have cost me ł20000 . 
who is friedman ? 
you lost my money ? 
last night you upset my sleep . tonight my social life . we have two minutes . my dinner guests are waiting . 
i still dont buy your story but i figured it cant do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry . besides if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner we could always get the right people onto you . i trust you know who i am talking about . 
huh ! who do you think we are mr lombard ? 
the family hired you and i have just fired you mr lombard . 
no . youre fired ! get out of my house . and take your sick tape with you ... 
get out of my house . youre fired mr lombard . 
no . the question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here mr lombard . 
how dare you ...   you dont know this tape belongs to my brother do you mr lombard ? 
oh no . youll have to do better than that mr lombard . 
where is it ?   he . the boy you said my brother bought ! where is he ? 
excuse me ? 
what ... what are you talking about ? 
you ... you found that at leons ? 
disney ! how inter ... 
anything is possible . 
can it be that easy ? 
oh - oh ! touché mr lombard ! but tell me what would you know about sisterly love eh ?   no . dont . you might get confused speaking of things you dont understand and we need you clear- headed at least until youve done what we are paying you for . 
for your information mr lombard trouble is possibly the one thing leon is capable of getting into all by himself . though i doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that . 
i wont comment on the time but youll understand if i dont tell you to sit down . now spare me the apology and get to the point will you mr lombard . 
perhaps it wasnt so brave of him . had i been here i just might have given him his money mr lombard . one can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct as someone in your line of work ought to know . 
i have too much money to work mr lombard . 
well leon does not need money for prints mr lombard . does his own printing . wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his art !   which as he subsequently vanished raises the question : what was the money for ? perish the thought . 
three weeks ago . to borrow money . i wasnt here but he got to my husband sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made . carlos handed over ł1000 to get rid of him . 
that depends what youre looking at . 
now you know why youre here mr lombard .   it might be difficult for someone like you to discern but we are people of a certain standing . 
huh ! and they say charitys only rewarded in heaven ... hallelujah ...   christ ... 
you can not walk away from this . you can not . 
my ex - husband . my work drove him away . made his life a misery . he thinks im obsessed punishing myself for what happened to our son .   but hes a good guy . hell listen to you . he wont turn you in if i ask him not to . i can pretty much guarantee that . okay ? 
... im emily stewart . the hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year - old boy disappeared . the pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat . however i go about this thats who i am . do you get what im fucking saying mr lombard ? 
damn it ! you cant fucking walk away from this ! 
look ! either you talk or the creeps are gon na walk . for gods sake . what am i supposed to say ? i got this from a french guy from england who broke in there to have a chat with an austrian child trafficker ? is that it ? 
a seminar in a baby breeding farm ! bodies in acid ! you think ill get anywhere with that ? jesus ! with luck i might raise a laugh . they might even send a patrol car to check the place out . whatever itll be too late . 
that - that wont do . thats not the way it goes . you saw it you tell it thats the way ... 
were both thinking the same thing right ? 
italian ? the mafia ... ? 
so who ... whos the man ? where is he ? 
what ... ? 
look you dont tell me about some godforsaken place where stuff so bad even i couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep ! what happened ? whos the guy ? the austrian ? 
have you found your man ? is that where he is ? 
oh . what ... yeah . okay . 
what am i to do with the packages if ... 
dont fall asleep with your hair wet . 
right ... well ill get your money first thing in the morning okay ?   okay . goodnight then . 
a little too tight eh ?   ... they were my sons . only thirteen and already six feet tall . a real lanky boy ...   i ... theres some cold chicken salad in the fridge if youre hungry . 
come on mr lombard . you tailed your man all the way here from europe . you told me you knew where to find him remember ? or didnt i hear you right ? 
did you not enter this country illegally ? 
its give and take time mr lombard . you need help we need information . you didnt really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it did you ? 
how come youre alive ? child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do .   what am i really looking at here huh ?   are you really not just a lousy private eye ? am i really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise ? 
like youll find a way to stop your austrian killing you a second time round ? 
no answer . you have no passport and your embassys out . how do you plan to leave the u.s. mr lombard ? 
a recent acquisition . weve had four break- ins this year alone ; files stolen computers wrecked faeces smeared on walls . the good guys dismiss us as alarmist do - gooders ; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us . an easy living indeed mr lombard .   i got through to moreau and jane . i left your landlord out of it . your flats been broken into . jane wants you to call her back . 
thereve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery . but still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation . officially its just not called for . sit down . can i offer you some coffee ? 
i might come back i might not . but if i do it wont be for a couple of hours . 
you know where to look for your austrian right ? 
there are over 4 million people in this city - why me ? 
have you never heard of collect calls mr ... 
you dont know why hes come to los angeles ?   the man you say he killed ? who was he ? a colleague of his ? 
by your austrian ? 
where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there ? 
okay . the woman just cant walk away ...   i want straight answers . no hesitation or i walk for sure . why cant you go to your embassy ? 
you ...   jesus christ ! 
i cant believe this ...   whats coming now eh ? if i dont pay all hells gon na break loose is that it ? 
is this some kind of sick stunt ? let me guess .   you want money right ? 
im fine standing thank you . 
i dont smoke . if you could get to the point ... 
youre a long way from home ... 
may i ask where youre from mr lamont ? 
shit ! fuck ! whats fucking wrong with people !   im going to bed . and sweet dreams to you to ! 
no . youre looking at a real musketeer here whitney . brave and rash . had to dash in there .   take a prisoner ... might as well have sent them a notice to quit ...   come on musketeer ! got anything to say ? 
look at him whitney . come all the way from england to clean up california . huh ! 
thats right . wheres the fucking italian eh mr french hero ? 
if you have hard evidence about a child trafficker we want it mr lombard . and we want it before you get yourself killed ... 
whitney armstrong my deputy . what whitneys trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your austrian ... 
yes . how did ... 
really ? and how are you eh ?   someone called pierre dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a brazilian friend of ... 
what are you up to eh savieer ? i mean not this but ... money passports a gun in a microwave ? who are you eh ? who are you ? 
your secretary huh ! 
piss off ! 
well im sorry . i ...   this is my nephew ... and my brother tim . ive got the week off and hes come to stay . 
no ... i told you on the phone . whoever broke in messed - up all your papers . i put everything back where i thought it ought to be .   maybe its there with ... 
hello there . hows the flat . i cleaned ... 
i came to feed your fish . i didnt know ... 
shes pretty ... see you huh ? 
oh yeah ! better be good and hurry away then ! who knows ? we might be being watched ! maybe one of your stupid french companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all thats what they do to their employees isnt it ? huh ! hope you enjoy ruining peoples lives . thanks for the lift ! 
oh no . im all right . he was a jerk really . another boy you know ? all i meet is boys . when i think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls . i mean is it true ? 
oh ... we split up . 
so you havent seen the film then ? 
i dont know . how many famous french film directors can there be ? 
la collectionoose. its about a young girl in the south of france who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her . its on tv tonight and as im in i thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and ... the review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct . and witty . the directors supposed to be famous . rommel or something . french . you must know him ? 
have you heard of a french film called la collectionoose ? 
yes . but my boss reckons youd still be better off as a limited company . for expenses and all that you know ? itd cost you about ł100 but he said itd be worth it .   of course youd need a partner to register . but thats a formality . i mean i could be your partner . i mean just as a name right ? 
must be your lucky day then . ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year . 
fine . how was the match ? did you loose ? 
hello again neighbour . i didnt intrude did i ? 
ł10000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy ? 
my husband and i will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in israel . deborah will be here if you need anything before our return . 
ha ... no mr lombard . his monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us . he knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate . 
we are aware of your rates mr lombard . we will pay you double your rates plus expenses . in return need i say it again we expect discretion and undivided attention . 
the ł1000 is on account . 
when ... im told he came here ... 
the proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about .   his address is in this envelope with leonards address keys and other things you might need . 
no . and before you ask no hes not gay ! he has had girlfriends but nothing serious ... 
he could indeed mr lombard . but had he done so i think he would have let us know about it . 
leonard does not hold a driving licence . as for his passport i do not know where he keeps it . 
yesterday . it all looked normal . 
then you should not have sought an explanation . 
i said earlier that my husband and i are supporting leonard in his photography mr lombard . by this i mean that since his return from america i have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold . so as you see i did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account . 
do what mr lombard ? 
you wouldnt be here if i knew mr lombard . what i do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks . that enquiries to the police and london hospitals have borne no results . and that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now . 
leonard . what my daughter is on about mr lombard is that leonard is somewhat of a bohemian . you might as well know that ... 
what i can appreciate is insolence mr lombard ! 
good . now as i trust you may have guessed we are looking for someone to work for us . someone whose discretion can be relied upon . someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment . do you think you could be that person mr lombard ? 
you may not . and besides it is irrelevant . 
must i speak to you in french ? 
whatever you come recommended . we ... 
what if it is ? 
lombard this is not a jewish name is it ? 
may i ask if you are jewish mr lombard ? 
spitz . we spoke on the telephone .   my husband ...   my daughter deborah whose house this is .   my son - in - law carlos ...   the gentleman is a business partner of his . 
i 'm not afraid of the fire anymore . it will purify me ... 
i 'm staying jean . 
one day you will . 
my gentle captain ... i 'm staying . 
i 'm already free ... 
i am ready now ... 
that 's an order ! 
do as i say ! 
get back inside the town and see if the english are attacking from the other side ! 
not yet ! 
it would not be the same without you . 
if god wants me to win he will find a way .   and if he wants me to die ... if he wants me back ... then that 's fine too .   then i 'll be with him forever . 
but it is what i want . 
i would like to marry you .   but i have already promised myself ... to god . 
i will ask my voices ... if they come back one day .   meanwhile ... i 'm going to compiegne . 
did you come back to marry me or to insult me ? 
no but ... 
it 's a trap !   they 're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from england ! 
what did the king say ? 
that 's not what i asked ... why do you want to marry me ? 
tell the king to give me more men . 
if you really want to help me there 's one thing you can do . 
so ... even you do n't believe in me anymore ... 
the truth is always simple ... it 's you jean who 's making things complicated . 
i do n't know it .   i feel it . 
all you have to do is stop talking and just listen . 
well of course they 're me !   that 's how god talks to me .   if you listen hard enough even you can hear him . everyone can hear him . 
it 's not time yet .   my mission is not over yet .   there is still more i must do before i can really -- finally -- go home . 
it 's been weeks since they spoke to me .   since the coronation ... no signs ... nothing ... 
they 've abandoned me ... like everyone . 
so ... what am i supposed to do now ? 
yes .   yes i 'm fine ...   we need more brushwood !   why are you staring at me like that ? 
i 'll go . 
come with me ... 
the king said you 're his finest archer ... ? 
alright ... i promise to rest if you promise ... to go back to the battle . 
no it 's ... it 's nothing it 's ... 
not so ... easily .   why are n't you ... fighting ... ?   go on ... we 're almost there ... 
they 've started the battle without me ! 
what did they say ? 
how dare you tell me what god tells me to do ! 
how dare you stop me doing god 's will ! 
there 's nothing to hear -- i have n't done anything .   and why have n't i done anything ?   because none of you will listen to me ! ! 
who do they think i am ? ! 
the king of england .   i want to give them the chance to leave orleans in peace before i get there . 
i thought you were an archer ? 
i also need someone who can read and write . 
better today than tomorrow . 
i shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner . 
yes .   i did n't confess today . 
and i would like to see a priest . 
i would like some fresh straw . 
do you think i could have some water ? 
no i ... i never killed anyone ! 
yes maybe ... i do n't remember ... 
no i ... i held it up to ... 
yes but ... 
yes probably ... maybe ... 
no !   i warned the english to go back home -- i begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat i would bring on them ... why did n't they listen to me ? 
no of course not ... i never killed anyone ... 
to avoid killing anyone . 
and so i ... i prefer my banner . 
no it 's just ... a sword is a weapon . 
i was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword . 
quite a few . 
i leave the answer to god . 
i ca n't read . 
i do n't know ... 
i do n't remember .   maybe . 
i tried to . 
i do n't know but you 're all men of the church ... why not ask him yourself ? 
go onto the next question . 
no .   but my revelations were for the king of france not for you . 
i wo n't tell you more about that . i 'm more afraid of displeasing him than not answering you ... 
god defeated the english not me . 
my king will pay any ransom you ask . 
where ... where am i ? 
am i ... am i dead ? 
but where are you going to be ? 
what about you ? 
i was talking to the priest and do you know what he said to me ? 
no no i 'm fine really ... 
i ask only one thing ... to hear me in confession ... 
it 's not my body i want to save . it 's my soul . 
and you ?   why did you lie ?   you promised i could be confessed ... 
i did n't mean it !   i did n't know what i was signing !   you tricked me ... ! 
please ... may i have it back ... 
and may i go to mass ? 
no ... i want to be confessed . 
i am sent by god and i submit all my words and deeds to his judgment . or do you think that you are better judges than he is ? 
so it is the church militant that refuses to confess me and so prevents me from being a good christian ? 
many things ... 
last night . 
not long ago ... 
these questions have nothing to do with your trial . 
and you be careful you who claim to be my judges for you too will be judged one day ... ! 
not unless you hear my confession . 
not unless you hear my confession . 
yes .   in the church at domremy . 
in a village called domremy . 
my name is jeanne .   my little cross i had round my neck was taken away from me .   i would like to have it back . 
i will willingly swear to tell you what i am allowed to tell you but as to the rest even if you threaten to cut off my head i still wo n't tell you . 
i will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things but as for my revelations i 've never told anyone except my king ... charles the seventh ... the one and only king of france . 
i do n't know what you 're going to ask me questions about .   you may ask things that i wo n't want to answer . 
the english ? ? 
but ... the king -- my king -- did n't he pay my ransom ? 
trial ?   what trial ? ? 
who are you ? 
oh thank you lord !   i 'm so glad to see you !   i need to confess ... i have n't been confessed since easter ... or been to mass ... will you hear me now ? 
peace will only be got from the english at the end of a lance ! 
so how would you put it ? 
why did you betray me ?   paris was ours for the taking !   all i needed was another few hundred men ... why did you take back the army you gave me ? 
get them out of here ! 
... you look wonderful ... 
i do n't need lodgings if we 're to be marching on orleans ... 
he said that i have to save france from her enemies and give her back to god and he told me that i -- jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at rheims to be crowned king of france . 
i did n't wait long .   one day i was going to mass like i do every day when the same strange wind started blowing again ... 
what was my mission ?   to help my country ?   but how could i do that ? i was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war ... so i decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it . 
i know you 're not yet -- but you will be soon . 
there 's no need to be afraid sire . 
go on to the next question . 
i 'm more interested in what he says not what he looks like . 
his face . 
go and ask him yourself . 
if there was i did n't see it ... 
not yet . 
the bridge wo n't wait ! 
stand by with the battering - rams ... 
i know what i 'm doing so either lend a hand or go back to bed ! 
we 're taking back the tourelles ! 
the wind will be with us !   do as i say . 
position the long - bows over there crossbows over there -- and set up dijon culverins either side of those trees ... 
sooner is better than later ! 
dunois ... was it you who ordered the attack ?   answer me ? ! 
knowing what i know ?   enormous gratitude . 
ah so that 's it .   to you i 'm just a girl . 
what complicated about it ?   all you have to do is do what you 're told -- what could be simpler than that ? i 'm the drum on which god is beating out his message -- beating so loudly it 's bursting my ears -- but you 're all so full of your own voices you 're deaf to his ! 
you know i feel a great sorrow for you because you 're laughing now but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of god . 
we offer the english a last chance to return home in peace .   if they refuse we recross the river and attack them here -- at the tourelles . 
you may have been with your counsel but i 've been with mine and i 'm telling you god 's counsel is wiser than yours and he 's telling me to speak to the english -- now ! 
because if they do n't i 'll raise such a war - cry against them that they will remember us forever ! 
for what ? 
good .   can you bring me to him ? 
it 's coming -- i rode on ahead .   i have to speak with the captain of the english army ... his name 's talbot ... 
good .   where are the english ? 
were you sent by lord dunois ? 
but my voices ... they promised me ... 
but ... where is dunois ... where are the men the king promised me ? 
of course i do ?   bring them up ! 
never look behind -- only ahead ! 
right behind us -- dunois with another then thousand men ! 
so ... bring up the reinforcements ! 
i know but so is the enemy -- they 're falling back -- paris is ours ... ! 
maybe ... i do n't know ... but first we have to confess ... 
i care !   and i care because god cares !   all life is precious to god -- even his -- even yours and mine ... 
no ... not like this ... 
the english are rebuilding it . 
we return to orleans ... across the bridge at the tourelles . 
i do n't think .   i leave that to god . i 'm nothing in all this i 'm just the messenger . 
it seems to me that the church and our lord are one and the same .   why must you complicate what is so simple ? 
i ... submit to our lord . 
it was just ... more convenient as i was among soldiers ... 
the clothes are not important ... 
yes but ... 
i know but that 's not the way things happened ... 
that 's now what i meant ... 
no ... ! 
i had been sold to the english .   i 'd rather die than fall into their hands . 
here -- take this instead . 
that 's different ... i mean ... we were fighting for a ... for a cause ! 
because ... because you just ca n't ! 
but you ca n't just kill a man for his teeth ! 
stop it !   what are you doing ? 
you do n't believe me anymore ? 
i said kneel ! 
a few teeth ... that 's the price of his life ? 
if you kill him you kill me ! 
take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first ! 
it 's not possible ... 
you call this ... glory ... ?   all this ... this blood ... this smell of ... 
we ... won ? ! 
not for long ... 
prepare these as battering - rams ! 
i 'd sooner die than use magic ! 
do n't swear ... 
were the men confessed ?   where are the priests ? 
what happened ?   who gave the order to attack ? 
they will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that . 
then lord dunois show me the way to the other side of the river ... 
la hire i 'm warning you -- do n't swear ! 
so who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river ? ? 
and you look pretty wealthy for a servant of god would n't you say ? 
yes i was given a few but i never had time to wear them ... 
five steeds and a few hackneys ... 
my king . 
yes ... a half - steed ... white . 
yes my lord . 
yes i am . 
there 's nothing for me to do here anymore ... i do n't belong here i want to be with him now ... 
are you sent by god ? 
are you going to leave me too ? 
my voices ... my voices ... do you think they will ever come back ? 
no i ... 
because ... because i do n't know what else to do to please him . 
i 'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful ... 
i -- i cleaned up my room look ... and i said my prayers ... all of them ... and ... 
i never took pleasure in hurting anyone ? 
why are you doing this to me ? ?   do you get pleasure from hurting me ? 
no i do not think so .   i do n't think that killing each other will ever bring peace . 
i ... i was defending myself as best i could !   everyone has the right to defend themselves do n't they ?   or should i have let myself be killed ? 
yes !   we fought and killed in his name ... the king of heaven ! 
no but ... why did n't he stop it ? or did he get pleasure watching us killing each other in his name ? 
stop stop ... i ca n't remember !   the battles were all so confusing ... there was so much smoke dust noise ... i was being attacked on all sides so ... maybe ... perhaps i fought back but it was only to defend myself ... 
no !   i do n't want to know anymore ! leave me alone !   i did n't kill that man ! 
i 'm not lying i ... i ca n't remember ... leave me alone ! 
but ... it did n't just get there by itself . 
like ... like the wind ... and the clouds ... and ... the bells ... and what about that sword lying in the field ... that was a sign ... ! 
no but ... he sent me so many signs ! 
yes ... lots of things ! 
because !   because i 've always been faithful to god and i 've followed everything he said ... and i 've done everything he asked me ... 
what do you mean they wo n't come ? 
because ... i have to be alone ! 
no no -- you ca n't stay or they wo n't come ! 
yes ... that 's what i pray for ... ! 
my ... visions ... 
what are you doing here ?   please ... leave ... you ca n't stay here ... 
i do n't understand .   what do you want from me ? 
i do n't know -- i do n't care anymore -- i just want to be at peace ! 
no no ... i 'm just so tired and lost and ... i did n't realize what i was doing ! 
i am true -- to my lord the king of heaven .   he knows how much i love him -- that 's all that matters to me ... 
i ... i never lied ! 
everything !   prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- i ca n't stand it anymore -- i 'd rather die ! 
i ... i 'm leaving ... i ca n't take anymore ... 
what are you doing out here ? 
i ... do n't know ... what do you want from me ? 
i do n't know ... please ... tell me i 'm dead ... 
i do n't know ... i thought ... 
no ... no ... i 'm just a messenger ... he needs me ... a higher calling ... 
who ... who are you ... ? 
i -- i -- i ... 
i want to be at one with him now . 
i want to be with him always ... 
i do n't want to wait for his call . 
then what will ?   and what will bring her back ?   and why did she have to die in the first place instead of me ?   why did n't he take my life instead of hers ?   it was my fault -- i was late -- she gave me her hiding place ... ! ! 
i know jesus says to love our enemies but i ca n't -- i just want the english to burn in hell for ever and ever ! 
why did she have to die ? 
he says ... he says i must be good ... and help everyone ... and take care of myself .   do you think he 's coming from the sky ? 
he never says his name . 
well i try and talk to him but mostly he 's the one who does the talking . 
i feel safe here .   and it 's where i can talk to him . 
yes it is . 
oh yes i play with them ... lots ... 
oh yes my sister 's just ... she 's ... wonderful . 
oh yes she 's ... wonderful . 
oh yes ... very . 
is that bad ? 
he already did but i want god to forgive me too . 
my father 's . 
they were n't my shoes .   mine were too small . 
i saw a poor monk without shoes so i gave him some . 
i need to confess again . 
i need to confess . 
i do n't even know you . 
and you expect me to come over just like that . 
you move right along do n't ya .

he 's never forgotten a promise to me .   i 'm worried about him .   i know something 's happened to him . 
but tonight is christmas eve ! 
it 's all right . 
i 'm sorry .

oh andy andy ! 
why not ? 
this is a pretty dead bunch is n't it ? 
go away ! 
why not ? i am crazy .... the whole family 's crazy . 
how would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children ?   it 'd be fun would n't it ?   maybe they 'd murder each other ...   keep it all in the family . that 's what father should have done .   he should have killed me and gilbert ... then we would n't have had this to go through . 
i ca n't marry you !   i ca n't ever marry you ! 
you do n't understand .   you do n't know what 's going to happen . 
please !   you ca n't get mixed up in this . 
and do n't ever try to see me again . 
you 're sweet but the only thing that you can do for me is to go . 
i ca n't . 
i ca n't help it .   you do n't know ..... 
oh andy . 
i do n't believe it ! you 're lying ! 
all right then .   i 'll tell them .

then what are you hiding ? 
you took that money from julia 's hand . 
do n't .   it 's horrible . 
did it ever occur to you that chris might work ? 
mother ....   you could n't do that . you could n't go to her . 
i wo n't have you hounding him any more for money . 
you just want money -- and you have n't any right to any more .   he made a big settlement on you . 
he 's all right .   is n't that enough ? 
do you know where he 's living ?   oh ....   well at least i 'm glad he 's all right .   thank you for calling . goodbye . 
give it to me . 
he did n't do it -- nick ! 
he would n't say . 
he 's waiting for you . 
thanks ...   we 're taking your cab . 
hello nick !   and a party - celebrating father 's third murder - 
that 's the truth . 
i bought it in a pawn shop . 
she ... she fell over backwards . 
i do n't know . 
she fell down . 
why ... in the heart . 
yes .   i hated her for coming between my mother and father .   she kept me from seeing my father .   i went down there to ask her where he was .   she would n't tell me and i shot her . 
you heard about julia wolf ? 
i 've got to see you alone ! 
oh thank heaven . 
thanks .   we will .   goodbye . 
how do you do ?   i 'm sorry we have to rush .

that 's what i was going to ask you .   he 's disappeared ! 
andy ...   this is nick charles .   he worked on a case for father . 
was fascinated with you ....   a real live detective ....   you used to tell me the most wonderful stories .   were they true ? 
you do n't remember me .....   i 'm dorothy wynant . 
are n't you nick charles ? 
you know we know each other . 
hello there ! 
goodbye darling .   do n't you dare forget ...   december 30th .

poor dad does that still bother you ? 
and he still wants to marry me ! 
you 're not missing much .   he 's cuckoo . 
you know how it is dad .   he 's sort of under mother 's thumb . 
he 's all right . 
it 's a promise ? 
we were planning to be married right after christmas . 
a new invention ? 
where are you going ? 
he can stay home .   please dad wo n't you ? 
this is my wedding . 
i hate all that fuss .   but i 'll do it on one condition -- that you 're there to give me away . 
mother 's set her heart on a big church wedding . 
dad this is what i really wanted to ask you .... 
he 'll still be your son - in - law ! 
take a good look at him dad .   now please try to remember him ... 'cause he 's going to be your son- in - law . 
it 's been the same one for three months . 
help yourself .   oh tom show this gentleman ... 
and if it is n't ? 
another young man . 
goodbye my boy .   take care of dorothy .   show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage . 
better get home before it is . 
only in bad weather . 
he 's a brave man . 
like all the rest of us .   has this fellow ...   ... has he seen the whole family ? 
i know -- i know -- 
i 'd like to see him .   why do n't you bring him down ? 
how 's your brother ? 
that 's one thing i wo n't forget .   where 's macaulay ?   i ought to be starting . 
oh i 'll be back before christmas . 
yes .   and i do n't want anybody to steal it from me . 
it 's a secret .   i ca n't even tell you my dear .   i 've got an important idea to work on . 
wait a minute .   when is it going to be ? i 'm leaving town tonight . 
if you think it 'll be all right . 
would n't it be a little embarrassing ...   all of us there ...   your other and me and your stepfather ? 
what would your mother say to that ? 
yes she would . 
you see how much we have to say . 
forgive me .   how are you ? 
then someone was in with you .   who was it ? -- who was it ?   i 'll answer that --   hello ...   hello ... 
what did you do with the rest ? 
you 're going to return every cent of it ! 
hello ....   give me ....   well ....   ? 
they 'll be pretty rough with you .... with your record . 
i want that money right now or i 'll hand you over to the police . 
that 's my business . 
no one else had the combination of that safe .   you took them .   what did you do with them ? 
now see here julia .   you 're counting a little too much on my being absent - minded .   you 've been taking a little here and there for some time and i have n't said anything about it .   but this is fifty thousand dollars ! 
i 'd never tell you to sell those . i bought them for my daughter . 
the government bonds .   the ones you took from the office safe . 
no .   i just came back for a second . i wanted to get those bonds . 
i do n't like him . 
i thought you 'd given up that sort of friend . 
who 's that man ? 
so i see . 
i left instructions with julia . she 'll get it from you .   goodbye . 
settle it yourself .   what have i got a lawyer for ? 
thanks and goodbye . 
you might do that .   get me a ticket for ...   no you do n't ! 
i trust you . 
never mind . 
that 's just why i 'm going . 
i 'm not telling anyone . 
did you get my money ? 
oh yes -- yes -- that 's right -- 
maybe she has . 
i know i left them there . 
i 'm going to give her a wedding present .   thought i 'd better do it now before i forget it .   i can drop them on my way to ...   that 's funny ....   where are those bonds ? 
who fired you ? 
where are you going ? 
i do n't care what you wanted to tell me .   you 're through !   get your things and get out ! 
two weeks work gone for nothing . 
and i 'll give then proof ! 
now do you believe me ! 
i do n't think you will .   it 's your father 's . 
i 'll do nothing of the sort . 
it 's a piece of evidence that 's worth a great deal more than that . 
i did n't . 
nonsense ! she got at she deserved . 
i did n't say i would .   but we 've got to have money . 
that 's gone long ago .   i 've got to see him .   where is he ? 
that is n't true .   it was about your father .   where is he ? 
what is it ? 
what is it ? has he found him ? 
oh here she is . 
how are you ? ....   oh i 'm mrs. jorgensen now ....   no she is n't here .   is it about her father ?   well can i take the message ? 
what are you talking about gilbert ? you were n't there ! 
children will you go into the next room ? i want to talk to chris alone . 
i hope you wo n't talk that way to the police when they come here . 
not a thing . 
that woman ! 
what is it gilbert ? tell mother ! what did he say ? 
that 's ridiculous . 
a brown suit brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red or reddish brown figures on it . 
that 's nothing .   i saw him myself . 
i do n't think so .   of course i was terribly upset ...   i hardly knew what i was doing . 
why yes . 
i see . 
why you said ... 
and there she was lying dead .   the police said she 'd probably been killed about ten minutes before i got there . 
chris -- chris -- ! 
you would n't do that ...   you would n't ! 
what are you going to do ? 
i could n't go near that woman . 
i know . 
i 'll get some . 
do n't mind what she says chris . 
i 'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
it is n't a story - it 's true .   i did see wynant .   he 's not dead . 
nobody told me .   i did see him ! 
perfectly absurd . 
because i do n't believe that clyde 's dead !   why you said yourself you saw him last night . 
he did n't say very much .   wanted to know how i was and how the children were . 
last night .   he came to see me at my apartment . 
this is all very pleasant but why are here ? 
all right then -- i 'll tell them who did do it ! 
i tell you -- he did n't do it . 
but he has nothing to do with it ! 
chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- i do n't see that it 's important -- 
where 's gilbert ? 
dorothy !   is she here ? 
but he knows you .   all you have to do is get in touch with him and tell him that mimi says everything is all right ... but that i 've got to see him . 
nick you will help me find clyde -- wo n't you ? 
you 're always teasing . 
oh i know he did n't but i wish i could find him ...   i have something very important to tell him . macaulay wo n't help at all .   he thinks i just want money . 
clyde wynant 's crazy ... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this . no wonder the police think he has something to do with it . 
want to talk to you about something very important . 
oh nick ... nick ! 
you 're a great help to a hostess . i wish i always had you for my dinner parties . 
mr. guild means guests !   oh there are two more to come . 
i think we may as well sit down . 
do you think that wynant did it ? 
but he 's interested ! 
good morning lieutenant -   sorry . 
oh please nick . 
so did we .   i mean sherlock here . 
asta - do n't bother mr. macaulay . 
oh he 's sitting up . 
oh hello .   come on in . 
is there a mr. macaulay in the house ?   oh it 's you . 
i hope you 're well . 
why are you saying it ? 
is that true ? 
if that knife is missing i 'll look for it in your back . 
you 're going to drive me crazy ! 
serve the nuts - i mean serve the guests the nuts . 
i wish you 'd tell me who . 
i ca n't wait any longer .   tell me do you think one of them did it ? 
you give such charming parties mr. charles . 
who do you think did it ? 
the suspects !   they wo n't come . 
i 've got a lulu -- why ? 
now nick what 's that got to do with it ? 
what are you going to do ? 
why not ? 
but the poor kid 's going crazy . she 'd rather know her father was dead than that ... 
i 'm going to tell her . 
wynant dead ?   does dorothy know ? 
then he could n't have committed those other murders . 
how long has he been dead ? 
you do n't get another swallow ' til you really open up . 
well do n't they ? 
what things made you so sure ? 
nick you 'll drive me crazy .   what things ? 
what makes you so sure it 's wynant 's body ? 
but they all said it was rosebreen 's . 
wynant 's body ? 
nick you 'd better lay off that liquor . 
what do you mean ? 
i want you to stay and find wynant . 
back to california 
i do n't care - i 'm just used to you that 's all --   if you let anything happen to him you 'll never wag that tail again ! 
do n't say it that way . say it as if you meant it . 
nickie take care of yourself wo n't you ? 
you dog ! 
you bet i would n't . 
go on - go on - see if i care . but it 's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to new york just to make me a widow . 
i know but this is different . he 's a crazy man . he might kill you . 
nick - i wo n't have you going down there . 
you mean he might be hiding there ? 
why should n't be close it ? he went away . 
what are you going to do ? 
what 's that ?   what are you up to ?   nickie - what is this ? 
he 's just been for a walk . 
i wish they 'd stop that .   it makes me fidgety . do you think they 'll find him nick ?   he must be in new york ....   where do you think you 're going ? 
catch me letting you go alone ! 
so am i. 
why do n't you ? 
but wynant --- ? 
the mystery 's all gone . and i wanted you to find out who did it . 
what 's the trouble asta ?   your balloon busted ?   so 's mine . 
all right hard guy .   get up and bleed on the rugs . 
sit down ! 
well that 's that .   stay there nick ! 
yes .   it 's asta 's christmas present . 
oh take it !   please take it ! 
he would n't ask you to handle it if he were guilty . 
philadelphia .   then he did n't do it did he nick ? 
i 'm stifling but it 's so pretty .   the kirbys . 
who 's that ? 
i read you were shot five times in the tabloids . 
finished with these ? 
you did . 
no .   it 's a christmas present . 
well did n't you ? 
he 's got more sense than you have . thank heaven you 're not on this case . 
i wish that doctor'd come .   how do you feel ? 
want a drink ? 
i 'll get some towels . 
well quick -- get into bed .   are you all right ? 
someone get a doctor . 
you idiot !   asta ! stop that !   get down !   now stay there . 
nick !   nick !   there 's someone to she you 
what are you going to give me ?   i hope i do n't like it . 
but it 's christmas now . 
i think i would like that drink .   i 'll give you your christmas present now if you 'll give me mine . 
she thinks you can . it would n't hurt you to find out if you could would it ? 
that poor girl is in a tough spot . 
i 'd like to see you work . 
everybody says you were a grand detective . 
no thanks . 
do n't you think you 'd like to go back to detecting once in a while just for the fun of it ? 
good . i want to talk to you . 
nick !   nick !   are you asleep ? 
too bad you did n't bring your whip . 
what are you going to do with it ? 
where did you get that ? 
is n't that my drink ? 
sounds like a good case .   girl mysteriously murdered .   no one knows who did it .   they have n't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints -- 
room service please - 
i 'd better order some food .   that sounds like an interesting case .   would n't you like to take it ? 
we need ice . 
who 's that ? 
i ca n't lie here .   i 've got to get up and trim that darned christmas tree . 
what hit me ? 
six martinis .   you 're not going to have anything on me . 
how many drinks have you had ? 
by the way how is your father 's side ? 
who is she ? 
you got types ? 
pretty girl . 
as long as there is n't a fire hydrant .   what i 've gone through -- 
you might have mentioned me first . 
i thought so .   he even tried to drag me into the gentlemen 's -- 
he 's dragged me into every gin mill on the block . 
so it 's you he was after ! 
was he a good detective ? 
yes .   nick ! 
i never had it . 
i ca n't ! i have n't got it ! 
i 'll give it back to you ....   all i 've got .... twenty - five thousand ... 
that 's a fine thing to throw up to me after all i 've been to you .... 
go ahead ! 
supporting that gang of loafers ! there 's not one of them that cares a damn for you .   a wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped .   they would n't raise a hand to help you .   and i 've given my whole life for you .   if you kicked off tomorrow where 'd i be ? out in the gutter !   sure i took those bonds .   who has a better right -- ? 
what if i did take them ? i 'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours .... 
do you realize that you 're accusing me of .... 
do n't you remember .... 
oh yes .   why you told me to sell them a long time ago . 
what bonds ? 
do n't worry .   you wo n't see him again .   what happened ? did you change your mind about going ? 
this is the first time i 've seen him in years .   i did n't want him to think i was high - hatting him . 
he 's not anybody .   just a fellow i used to know . 
we 're just having a little drink . 
looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who 's better than who do n't we epps ?   like i said ; i expected more from you . 
give it to me ! 
if i do n't answer he 'll know something 's up . 
i have to answer him . 
they 'll kill you .   you wo n't make it ten feet before they cut you down . 
that 's just what things came to . sometimes you ca n't help that .   it does n't change me respecting you .   and now you let me down .   i expected more from you you know ?   i really did .   i expected you to-- 
you disappoint me epps .   always figured you to be a man ; a real bright guy .   i had respect for you . 
thanks for taking care of this for me . 
look i know you guys are telling the truth .   it 's just the shi'ites do n't know that .   i guess you could tell them ... but then you do n't speak the language do you ? 
sure and i guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with . 
in the flack jacket .   still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat . took the air right out of me but i was just unconscious for awhile .   ' course you did n't stick around to find that out . you left me for dead . 
nothing about him unless he 's got a problem about me dealing with you . 
then i suppose it 'd be insurrection and i suppose i 'd have to kill you .   i suppose . 
i 'm the one 's got the big stick . 
without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge . 
no navicom .   a lot of good you are now epps . 
what if i do ? 
in the service you do but we 're not particularly in the service right now . way i see it what we 're doing that does n't particularly give you the right to toss orders around . 
you 've got an awful lot of orders in you . always giving orders . 
get out of my way . 
then step aside . 
it 's a combat action . 
i 'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around .   i have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you do n't have the stomach to do what has to be done . 
he tried to kill us .   if not just now then in the helicopter .   that 's all the authority i need . 
we 're at war . 
he 's an enemy soldier . 
you do n't know he is n't . 
that 's what he says .   he could be a spy or something . 
we ca n't just leave him .   he 'll run back to his outfit report our position ... 
i do n't care what he says he wanted our gold .   would have slit our throats if he had the chance . 
he ... he could have been watching us . 
says he wanted food .   liar .   he wanted the gold . 
says they were deserters they were afraid to fight do n't believe in saddam anyway .   they flew the gunship up here to hide out .   when they saw us they figured we were going to kill them so they shot first . 
i told you ; do n't push me around . 
i told you .   he tried to steal our gold . he tried to kill us . 
he snuck in here thinking we were asleep only i was n't sleeping .   would have slit our throats if i had n't stopped him . 
you got no reason to hit me .   i 'm getting tired of you and jaeger pushing me around . 
you got no reason to do that ! 
maybe i do n't need your ideas .   maybe i can do better on my own . 
maybe you 've got ideas of your own for the gold .   maybe you 've already got things worked out . 
you 're the one with all the ideas . 
what if we get separated ?   way i see it if something happens i want to be carrying my share . 
maybe we should split it up now . 
what about the gold ? 
you ready ? 
ready when you are . 
what am i supposed to do ? 
and they ca n't fly around out there forever . 
weird they did n't chase us . 
where 'd they go ? 
otherwise whatever we 're looking for could be anywhere . 
what do you figure it to be ? 
the us army :   always an adventure . 
probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here .   worn down to nothing now . 
and find the treasure and get it and get back to the humvee and get the hell out of iraqi without getting our heads blown off but that 's about it . 
we ca n't just go off and-- 
we can fight .   that 's what we 're here for :   to fight the iraqis .   to help the shi'ites and the khurds . 
the soldiers are going to kill those people ! 
should have at least gotten the map off of him .   blows up with him then we did all this for nothing . 
what if it 's a valloro 69 ?   just going to bounce right up out of the ground explode in the air kill him and us . 
for climbing . 
should have blown already .   delayed fuse that 's vietnam stuff . 
what kind of mine ? 
he 's an idiot and he 's not nearly as hard as he thinks . 
not much chance of that .   jaeger 's an idiot . 
him getting us stranded out here does n't do much good either . 
what are you doing . 
deserters would have run they would n't have engaged . 
we should n't have been here epps .   there is a war going on ! 
oh jesus they 've stopped . 
they stopped . 
what are we going to do ! ? 
no please not again . 
i 'd settle for being alive .   really . alive would be fine . 
oh god . 
you 're out of your minds you know that ? both of you .   you do n't even know if there 's anything out there .   what the hell are you thinking ? 
damn this is sweet .   we are going to be home in no time . 
it 's a map i think that 's what it is . 
what 's it say ? 
well based on my knowledge of the region its culture and her people i would have to say it 's a box . 
i did n't learn arabic because we were getting shipped here .   you do n't learn it in a couple of weeks .   i studied it in high school . 
... and it 's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone .   it 's considered offensive . 
think we 're going to do it ?   think we 're going to war ? 
you actually got around to killing someone .   i 'm impressed .   i guess you 're only half a bitch . 
when my shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an american they were very apologetic .   turns out we 've been kicking ass in this little war .   they figure we 've finally gotten saddam off their backs .   they brought me to their camp cleaned me up fed me ... i 'm their new best buddy .   america number one joe . but there 's something the shi'ites ca n't figure out :   they ca n't figure out why my two buddies two fellow americans left me out in the desert .   they ca n't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an iraqi outpost .   it 's almost as if they were iraqi spies or something .   and i 've got to tell you they hate anything that 's got to do with the iraqis .   see how i mean ? 
probably shot a few .   scattered the rest . murderers . 
the white reflects the sun ; it keeps you cooler .   that 's why they wear them . 
you want to say some words ? 
he 'd just slow us down and drink our water .   and if we ran into any more iraqis you know he 'd sell us out . 
i 'm not wasting my water on him . 
all last night he could have been-- 
says he 's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter . 
he 's a soldier .   he does n't need a weapon .   he 's got rocks .   he 's got bare hands . 
what the hell are you doing ! ? 
what do you see ? 
you down ? 
it 's got a bottom . 
what do you think ? 
just seems weird they did n't chase us . 
we make it or we go back empty handed . 
you 're the one wanted to kill iraqis so bad . 
we 're american soldiers .   we do n't abandon people . 
we have to do something . 
is there anything you do know ? 
those people down there are shi'ites . you 've got shi'ites in the south of iraq and khurds in the north .   neither of them've got much love for saddam . probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some . 
i 'm getting tired of you riding me jaeger . 
if all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself . 
you want to crawl crawl . 
have n't found a mine for half a mile or more . 
how long we going to keep this up . 
does n't matter .   we 're not going to be able to get him off it anyway . 
really ?   what is that an order < u > private</u > ? 
you two do n't even know how crazy you are .   you want to go on your sick little treasure hunt then go ahead but mark me absent . 
then lets go back while we still can . 
so you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel ?   knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere ? 
we just about got killed .   you know what happened ?   we just about got killed and you want to go on ? 
we have to go back . 
we got to get out of here . 
i thought we were dead . 
i think i 'm going to throw up .   i am . i 'm going to toss . 
oh jesus ! 
oh god ! 
this is too much .   you do n't even have the money and you 're wasting it . 
if there 's gold .   if ! 
how the hell should i know how much ? 
i do n't know .   it would be small easy to transport and hide .   gold or jewels . probably gold . 
if !   if there 's a treasure . 
oh no . 
we 're going to get court martialed you know that . 
god !   i do n't believe i 'm doing this .   i do n't . 
you 're insane if you think you 'll find anything and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive . 
epps you 're smarter than this .   jaeger i understand but you 're smarter . 
so you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase ?   it 's crazy .   tell him it 's crazy epps . 
it 's not a hundred miles .   it 's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain :   pure desert mountains a river .   if the map is even real . 
you do n't know where the iraqis have moved to .   and our forces have n't even engaged the republican guard yet we do n't know-- 
you 're not saying what i think you 're saying .   i ca n't believe you 're even thinking it . 
those soldiers have got loafers on .   what kind of army gives their soldiers loafers ? 
it 's a container .   break the seal . 
the longer the air force hits the iraqis the safer it'ii be for us when we have to engage . 
this is so weird .   it 's happening but it 's not .   it 's like a tv show and we 're part of it . 
you ever think about it ?   you ever worry ? 
you ever think about dying ? 
why would they do all that if we were n't ? 
we 're going to war are n't we .   if they 're doing all that it must mean we 're going to war . 
they 're cancelling all leaves all passes .   no more drills .   we stand at full ready starting-- 
that 's in two days . 
you know the fifteenth is the deadline for the iraqis to get out of kuwait . 
you really think there 's a treasure inside ? 
you will .   you 'll get it . 
you get it yet ? 
and you 're the guy who 's going to open it . 
it 's a puzzle box .   if you can figure out how to open it there 's supposed to be a treasure inside . 
he says it 's a box . 
now you need me . 
do n't even try it .   you offend a woman out here you 're in serious trouble . 
do n't shoot me i 'm friendly .   you can use that when you surrender . 
i thought it would be good to know . 
i 'm just trying to help you guys out .   it does n't hurt to know something about saudi arabia . 
come on .   you 're going to get us in trouble . 
i 'm saying do n't do it accidently . 
people were suffering in afganistan and we did n't do anything . 
i do n't think we 'll go to war .   we should n't even be here .   this is n't our fight it 's a regional conflict .   it should be decided regionally . 
yes .   yes .   that 's exactly it .   yes . 
yeah a headache .   my head hurts .   you 're making me uncomfortable . 
could you stop please .   you 're giving me a headache . 
i 'm not afraid ... i'm not afraid . 
oh thx ... hold me hold me thx holds her tightly tears in his eyes .   they kiss and luh hides her head in thx 's chest . 
they 're watching us now . 
they know .   they 've been watching us .   i can feel it . 
ah ugh . 
do n't let them separate us . 
we could leave and live in the superstructure .... 
i know you can do it without sedation you can i know you can . 
you do n't know .   you do n't .... 
if you .... if you go back on sedation you wo n't feel the same way about me .   you 'll report me for drug evasion . 
i do n't know . 
i do n't want to lose you . 
but ... you ... 
on the cervix transfer you almost lost the t297 . 
you slipped on a t297 transfer just before lunch did n't you ? 
no .... i though   i 'm afraid . 
promise ... please do n't thx leaves the room . 
do n't take anything . 
no !   do n't go . 
it 's 3 + 27 hundred 
i was so scared ... i did n't know what would happen with you ... once i started .   i almost let you go on so many times .   it will be worth it together .   when i was alone i knew . 
what? ... oh no thx .   that 's not true .   not satisfied ?   thx i need you so much . 
that 's not food .   ca n't be food . 
looks like dirt . 
do n't be so sure . 
i did n't .   you asked me about the card .   you 're going to get us into trouble . 
no do n't make trouble .   it 's nothing . 
i have to ... he 's a g-34 
i do n't know . 
he wants me to come to his quarters . 
i have to see sen .   i 've just been given a shift change . 
eat your dinner . 
you 've seen enough . 
no your going to eat it or it will go to waste . 
well it 's fixed so you 'll have to eat it . 
well have you found it ? 
what ?   i may lose it again ? but i have n't found it yet ! i 'm sorry . goodbye !   yes ? 
with the compliments of colet and company ! 
eleven o'clock ! 
is this what you mean m'sieu laval ? 
where did you find it ? 
divine ... but that terrible policeman ! 
but it could have been glorious . 
giron ... ! 
i do n't believe it ! 
and you expect me to believe that ? 
< u > adolph</u > ? 
yes gaston ? 
thank you .   seventy - six eighty-- 
but why talk about robbery on a night like this ? 
i would n't say anything -- i would act . 
yes gaston ? 
no -- thirty - five ! 
ah let me have a little fun . 
but i do n't want to be a lady . 
when a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman 's room where does she put them ? 
because i want to make it tough for you . 
i < u > believe</u > you . 
i know it . 
i < u > must</u > go . 
< u > shut</u > < u > up</u>--<u > kiss</u > < u > me</u > !   wasting all this marvelous time with arguments ! 
any minute i want ! 
and you 're going to fall for them . 
like that ! 
yes i would ! 
but incidentally let me tell you < u > i</u > do n't like < u > you</u > . i do n't like you at all !   i would n't hesitate one instant to ruin < u > your</u > reputation -- like that ! 
m'sieu laval i 've got a confession to make to you ... 
afraid i 'm ruining your reputation m'sieu laval ? 
talk ? about me -- about us ? 
good night . 
correct !   good night . 
how do you like my dress ? 
um - hum ... 
um - hum ... 
what are you going to do with my day tomorrow m'sieu laval ? 
and so will m'sieu giron . 
will you be good enough to run through these papers with m'sieu giron ? 
you 're hired ! 
what would you do if you were my < u > secretary</u > ? 
ye - es ? 
tell me m'sieu laval what else is wrong ? 
and how i handle my < u > money</u > ! 
then i mislay my checkbook-- 
that sounds sensible . 
you think that 's too much ? 
too happy . that 's why i discharged her . 
this used to be my secretary 's room . 
it < u > is</u > beautiful . but i got a little tired of sleeping in antiques so i gave it to my secretary . 
as you like . 
no . what is it ? tell me . 
then i 'm glad i lost the bag ! i 'll write you the check immediately . 
goodbye m'sieu la-- oh yes ... this is a rather delicate matter and i do n't want to ... you see if you read my advertisement carefully you must have noticed that there was ... 
do you realize i have light eyes ? 
peaches and cream . 
no no no !   i disagree with you completely ! i tried it once-- 
too much blue in crimson . 
what 's wrong now ? 
m'sieu laval ! 
oh ! you did n't read it ! 
but really m'sieu this is n't necessary . 
well -- how do you do m'sieu laval ? 
well -- i am madame colet . 
of course it is ! are you doubting me ? 
i do n't know how i could have lost it there .   i was nowhere near that niche . 
not particularly . 
i remember . 
i know that niche . 
that 's it ! yes that 's it ! ... jacques ! 
yes ... ? 
he is my secretary ! i hope that answers all your questions m'sieu giron . 
i know ! 
to m'sieu laval ? 
but my dear m'sieu giron i 'm having a tea party . must i be bothered with all these papers now ? 
mademoiselle gautier -- or whatever your name is -- i thank you for your advice but i must ask you to go . you 've got your money-- 
i beg your pardon ! 
i think you 'd better go . 
well in times like these most people are cutting salaries but suppose we say in your case three hundred and fifty ? 
how much is your salary ? 
oh no no no no my dear child ! that 's ridiculous . you go home as usual -- five o'clock every day . now i 'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant -- i insist . it 'll be nice for your little brother too . < u > five</u > < u > o'clock</u>--remember ! 
yes ! and he would have a little more time for-- 
no he < u > works</u > too much .   he 's chained to his desk . too much detail . now if you could take over some of his work-- 
to me he seems rather nervous . 
now . uh -- mademoiselle -- in the short time you have been m'sieu laval 's secretary have you noticed any change in him ? 
potatoes . he does n't want me to eat them--   and naturally i do n't want to upset him . 
you see--   oh not a word to m'sieu laval ! 
please !   thank you . 
yes that 's the trouble with mothers . first you get to like them and then they die . 
you 've had your breakfast -- oh but of course you have . 
well where is it ? 
but you saw it here . 
apparently not . do n't you know where it is ? 
yes my bag ! 
you should have more self - control . you were in the army . 
then why did you do it ? 
but you 're the more intelligent one . 
you should be ashamed of yourselves . two men of your standing always quarreling . 
goodbye -- madame colet and company ! 
leave me alone ! you were willing to sacrifice a hundred thousand francs for her .   well--   she 's worth it ! [ you were willing to pay a hundred and twenty - five thousand for a < u > handbag</u > . you can pay a < u > hundred</u > thousand for him ! ] 
do n't you dare lie to me !   i know you love me .   well why do n't you say something ? come on -- be brilliant . talk yourself out of it -- bluff yourself in !   shut up you liar you !   that 's what i want !   this is real ! money ! cash ! 
shut up ! do n't make up any stories ! 
thirty - five to the left -- sixty- three eight ... i would n't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... seventy - six eighty - four fifty - five--   what has she got that i have n't got ? 
that 's what i 'm here for -- to get out ! i want to get away from here from you -- as fast as i can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me .   sixty - five ninety - four-- 
yes < u > m'sieu</u > < u > colet</u > ? 
what time is your rendezvous ? 
< u > auf</u > < u > wiedersehn</u > . 
< u > am</u > < u > berliner</u > < u > zug</u > . 
< u > grossartig</u>--<u > kolossal</u > ! 
well see you at the berlin express . 
hello ... is this the spanish consulate ? this is dońa ignacio fernandez .   my husband and i are leaving tonight for berlin ... is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? thank you thank you .   how long will it take you ? 
at twelve twenty . i know .   lyons two four seven one .   two more days and we 'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more ! 
spanish passports ? 
he recognized you ! 
five seven and nine-- 
darling remember you 're gaston monescu . you 're a crook . i want you as a crook . i love you as a crook . i worship you as a crook . steal swindle rob -- but do n't become one of those useless good - for - nothing gigolos ! 
gaston . let 's open it -- right now ! let 's get away from here !   i do n't like this place ! 
they 're all right are n't they ? 
did you ever take a good look at her -- uh-- 
< u > this</u > < u > woman</u > < u > has</u > < u > more</u > < u > than</u > < u > jewelry</u > . 
but it 's not enough ! 
you ! and she 's willing to pay as high as fifty francs ! 
and her < u > jewelry</u > is worth a fortune ! 
seven and nine ! 
we 'll take the royal suite ! 
the fourteenth of may. 
darling then let 's be honest and return it to the lady . 
yes ! do n't you remember the day you took that chinese vase from the royal palace   and made it into a lamp for my night table ? 
i always liked him . especially last year in munich ... 
darling !   now tell me -- tell me all about yourself . who are you ? 
what time is it ? 
thank you baron . 
i like you baron . 
no thank you . 
thank you . 
please .   when i came here it was for a little adventure -- a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow . but something has changed me -- and it is n't the champagne .   the whole thing is new to me . very new . i 've got a confession to make to you .   baron you are a crook .   you robbed the gentleman in two fifty - three five seven and nine .   may i have the salt ? 
no -- proud . very proud ! 
someone from another world -- so entirely different . one gets so tired of one 's own class -- princes and counts and dukes and kings -- ah ! and everybody talking shop -- always trying to sell jewelry ... and then i heard your name and found you were just one of us . 
you know when i first saw you i thought you were an american . 
but she talks a lot . and before this night is over all venice will know it . and tomorrow it will be grand canal gossip ! ... oh ! 
you 'd better not . he 's really very dull . but anyhow when the king tells the marquis he saw me the marquis will tell the marchesa . and the marchesa is the best friend of the duchess of chambro . and < u > she</u > will phone the princess de costa . the princess does n't like me -- but i do n't care ! 
do you know the marquis de la tours ? 
do you < u > know</u > king boris ? 
the tennis player . he saw me . he bowed . what could i do ? i nodded .   baron i should n't have come ! 
the marquis de la tours . he was in the lobby . but i do n't think he saw me . i 'm positive he did n't . thank heaven ! ... but when i came up here right out in the hall there was king boris of alconia ! 
i do n't want your money ! 
let me give you a little advice . when you embrace him be sure to put on your gloves . it would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ... 
ever had a romance with a crook ? 
oh madame you 're just too sweet for words ! 
yes madame ? 
very well madame . thank you . 
i 'll do my best madame even if i have to work every night . 
for all the really important things-- 
so he would n't be confined so much to his office-- 
nervous ?   um - hum . he smokes too much ! 
well -- uh -- yes and no . 
naturally not ! 
about what ? 
yes madame ? 
may i ? 
two lumps madame ? 
yes madame . you see i have to get up very early .   my little brother goes to school--   you see mother is dead . 
and to you mr. andrews . 
wo n't you even make a try for it mr. andrews ? 
bottom left right . i have it . 
no ! i 'll do this with or without your help sir . but without will take longer . 
mr. andrews thank god ! where would the master at arms take someone under arrest ? ! 
yes i understand . thank you . 
you 're certain ? 
i saw the iceberg mr. andrews . and i see it in your eyes . please tell me the truth . 
mr. andrews i did the sum in my head and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned ... forgive me but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard . 
your ship is a wonder mr. andrews . truly . 
jewels are precious . goodbye mr. hockley . 
tell her that her daughter died with the titanic . 
is this in any way unclear ? 
yes i lived . how awkward for you . 
i 'd rather be his whore than your wife . 
oh mother shut up !   do n't you understand ? the water is freezing and there are n't enough boats ... not enough by half . half the people on this ship are going to die . 
but i was with him the whole time . 
something serious has happened . 
i 'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command ! i am your fiancee -- 
i see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me . 
i was tired . 
the heart of the ocean . cal it 's ... it 's overwhelming . 
my god ... cal . is it a -- 
is that the going rate for saving the woman you love ? 
i was leaning way over to see the ... ah ... propellers . and i slipped and i would have gone overboard ... and mr. dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself . 
it was ... stupid really . i was leaning over and i slipped . 
cal stop ! it was an accident . 
you 're wrong . they 're fascinating . like in a dream ... there 's truth without logic . what 's his name again ... ?   picasso . 
i felt like black . 
you told me to change . 
i promise . i will never let go jack . i 'll never let go . 
i promise . 
i ca n't feel my body . 
i 'm so cold . 
it 's getting quiet . 
it 's so cold . 
you jump i jump right ? 
i 'm not going without you . 
will this work ? 
i 'll be right back . 
i did n't .   i just realized i already knew . 
i know i know . 
he could n't have . 
cal you ca n't be serious ! we 're in the middle of an emergency and you -- 
come with me jack . i jump you jump ... right ? 
we have to tell mother and cal . 
could it have damaged the ship ? 
i know . it does n't make any sense . that 's why i trust it . 
when this ship docks i 'm getting off with you . 
you 're trembling . 
au contraire mon cher . 
to the stars . 
he 's an ex - pinkerton . cal 's father hired him to keep cal out of trouble ... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town ... 
i believe you are blushing mr. big artiste . i ca n't imagine monsieur monet blushing . 
a diamond . a very rare diamond called the heart of the ocean . 
not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out . 
cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere . 
will this light do ? do n't artists need good light ? 
fabrizio said you might be up -- 
i have to get back they 'll miss me . please jack for both our sakes leave me alone . 
it 's not up to you to save me jack . 
you 're making this very hard . i 'll be fine . really . 
jack i -- 
i like that . are n't we supposed to wish on it ? 
i did did n't i ?   look ! a shooting star . 
a mistake ? 
i do n't know the steps . 
may i cut in miss ? 
jack must you go ? 
cal surely you remember mr. dawson . 
i think i would .   and teach me to spit too . like a man . why should only men be able to spit . it 's unfair . 
you mean one leg on each side ? scandalous ! can you show me ? 
why ca n't i be like you jack ? just head out for the horizon whenever i feel like it .   say we 'll go there sometime ... to that pier ... even if we only ever just talk about it . 
a whole ten cents ? ! 
so then what mr. wandering jack ? 
well alright . there 's something in me jack . i feel it . i do n't know what it is whether i should be an artist or i do n't know ... a dancer . like isadora duncan .... a wild pagan spirit ... 
listen buster ... i hate caviar ! and i 'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head . 
you know my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist ... living in a garret poor but free ! 
and ... ? 
you have a gift jack . you do . you see people . 
i think you must have had a love affair with her ... 
you liked this woman . you used her several times . 
and these were drawn from life ? 
oh no ! oh i 'm so sorry . truly ! 
jack these are quite good ! really they are . 
may i ? 
what 's this ? 
oh jack ... please do n't judge me until you 've seen my world . 
if only it were that simple . 
yes exactly ! 
worse i 'm afraid . 
penguin ? oh cal ! he is them . 
oh god i am such an utter fool . 
i do n't ... it was n't just one thing . it was everything . it was them it was their whole world . and i was trapped in it like an insect in amber .   i just had to get away ... just run and run and run ... and then i was at the back rail and there was no more ship ... even the titanic was n't big enough . not enough to get away from them . and before i 'd really though about it i was over the rail . i was so furious . i 'll show them . they 'll be sorry ! 
look i know what you must be thinking ! poor little rich girl . what does she know about misery ? 
here i am . i ... i want to thank you for what you did . not just for ... for pulling me back . but for your discretion . 
jack ... i feel like such an idiot . it took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you . 
mr. dawson i -- 
rose . rose dewitt bukater . 
could i speak to you in private ? 
help ! help ! ! 
pleased to meet you mr. dawson . 
you 're crazy . 
i know what ice fishing is ! 
how cold ? 
the fall alone would kill you . 
do n't be absurd . you 'll be killed . 
you 're distracting me . go away . 
what do you mean no i wo n't ? do n't presume to tell me what i will and will not do . you do n't know me . 
no ! stay where you are . i mean it . i 'll let go . 
do n't come any closer . 
i 'm afraid i 'm feeling a little tired mr. lovett . 
i can still feel its weight . if you could have felt it not just seen it ... 
it 's been 84 years ... and i can still smell the fresh paint . the china had never been used . the sheets had never been slept in . 
it 's been 84 years ... 
someone named hockley i should imagine . 
it was a dreadful heavy thing .   i only wore it this once . 
i should like to see my drawing . 
there that 's nice . i have to have my pictures when i travel . and freddy of course .   is n't that right sweetie . 
yes . very nice . have you met my granddaughter lizzy ? she takes care of me . 
goodbye mother . 
it 's so unfair . 
how can you put this on my shoulders ? 
of course i know it 's gone . you remind me every day ! 
mother may i introduce jack dawson . 
excuse me . 
no darling lip rouge -- all over your mouth . 
i like touching you -- poison ivy .   you 'd just been kissing that girl when i came in had n't you ? 
and when you do i 'll convey your respects by wireless to herbert .   take it easy lee -- no other woman'll ever get you . at least i 'm honest when i tell you there must be something pretty low down in me -- because i like you .   you 're such a swine ! 
oh -- a hundred times-- 
just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her . 
did you muss up her hair by accident too ? 
do n't look so uncomfortable lee -- it interferes with your good looks . give me a cigarette .   what did you do -- persuade her to come on this voyage with you ? 
sure ! you 're never at a loss for words . 
so that 's your little dancer that you were playing around with in new york .   oh -- there 's no accounting for tastes--   mine too seem to be in the gutter . 
and < u > do</u > bring miss marsh--   --when she 's had time to tidy up a bit . 
well -- shall we go into dinner ? 
yes -- i met miss marsh . in fact she always seems to be turning up in the most unusual circumstances .   what 's the matter miss marsh -- aren't you feeling well ? 
hope we 're not intruding . 
i 'm sorry but you three men can play poker or something .   shall i see you tomorrow ? 
that 's fine -- because you 're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life . 
here 's to europe !   could n't try to look a little less glum could you ? 
i never want to go back .... 
when i found out you were going i just had an attack of nerves -- a few tears -- and herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... i 'm here with you ... and that 's all that matters to me . 
you 're a charming liar . you < u > know</u > herbert 's too dull to be suspicious about anything -- even when i suddenly decided to come to europe at a few hours ' notice-- 
it would be a nice change from you . 
then why the sudden exit without even telling me ? 
any woman 's crazy to feel about a man the way i do about you . 
do n't you hate people that surprise you ? ... i do .   we ca n't stand here . 
no -- i'm furious!--nobody seems to do anything about it-- 
yes -- and < u > very</u > popular-- 
we 'll save you a place at our table . 
that 's a date . 
sooner -- if you like .   see you again i hope . 
feeling a little better i see . 
i 'm just commencing to enjoy this trip . 
i do n't understand . 
sorry i ca n't return the compliment . 
thanks no . i despise any form of exercise .   do n't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards . 
where 's lother ? 
no!--did < u > you</u > take that bracelet ? 
i 'm going down to my cabin . i have to send a wireless-- see you later . 
< u > gladly</u > . 
you 'll excuse me . 
is n't that interesting ? 
i think you do . 
you were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--   --and he was gentleman enough to boast < u > why</u > you 'd been there and show me a snapshot of you . 
you 're anya rosson are n't you ? i 've heard of you back in new york . 
how do you do . would you care to finish the game ? i have a slight earache .   --and it 's so noisy up here . 
what 's the matter ? 
seven - fifty . positively my last offer . 
i 'll change and be with you in ten minutes . 
i 'm beginning to think you 're a pretty swell guy . 
he 's a con man -- crooked as a tree -- and i was part of the racket -- helped him !   now -- if you have an appointment elsewhere -- i'll excuse you ! 
too much -- remember -- i warned you about me--   i used to be lee lother 's girl-- 
that was the come - on -- promise me you wo n't play with them again-- 
oh you infant ! how much did you lose ? 
who with ? 
how well do you know her ? 
yes -- i remember-- 
i could see you were pining away-- 
good night idiot ! 
i think we ought to walk . 
you 're a little ahead of yourself -- the usual routine would be for you to propose and if i accept then you 'd give me an engagement ring-- 
i did n't < u > know</u > we were < u > going</u > to be married . 
what again ? 
we 'll let it go at that-- 
this time i 'm really glad you showed up . 
yes -- is it all right if i come like this ? 
do n't let 's talk about it . 
let 's forget it -- can't you see i kind of like you too ... and i do n't want to get involved . 
--i know what i 'm talking about . i 'm no high - school girl looking through a window -- reaching for the moon .   guess i 'll be going . 
will you take some advice ?   if you 're looking for romance -- count me out--   --if you know what 's good for you . 
do n't kid me . i 'm in no mood for it . 
you do n't know anything about me . if you did you probably would n't be here . 
that 's funny -- so was i.   guess the ocean makes one sentimental 
what are you thinking ? 
mighty decent of you pal . 
a little . 
i must say you 're persistent--   --it 's kind of flattering . 
i 'm sorry i 'm late but something happened . 
i 'll be there -- good - by . 
wrong again--   but i dislike possessive women . 
at seven - thirty ? 
but i 'll have cocktails with you . 
well i ca n't . 
you asked me to dine with you tonight . 
very -- your mother ? 
a little boy that has escaped from his nurse and-- 
what a horrible death ! do you know what you remind me of ? 
nothing to speak of . what is this -- third degree ? 
keep your eyes on the ball mister . 
you < u > are</u > a lunatic ! 
mr denby and mr. mckinney . 
this is mr.--er-- 
never eat before the show . 
you work too fast for me young man . 
you 're not very ambitious are you ? 
--sorry -- got an appointment to play shuffle - board . 
good - by ! 
good - by . 
so you washed it off ! 
oh -- hello !   i got the flowers . that was sweet of you -- thank you . 
--you'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--   --let me wipe it off . 
you 've got lipstick all over you . 
like her paint job ? 
she looks like a lot of other boats . i grant you she 's beautiful . 
yes -- are you ? 
i thought you were one of my friends . 
i 'm so sorry ! 
why -- don't you like him ? 
i do n't get the humor of that remark . 
you 're just a master of ceremonies . he might have knocked his head off . 
women are such fools!--why do so many of us pass up < u > right</u > guys ? 
come on now -- you've forgotten all about that . 
chad denby broadcasting--   --the nicest man i ever knew-- 
women have a curious taste for knickknacks . when i found out about ned -- tried to make a break -- lee would n't stand for it and -- well -- here i am ! 
i was so crazy about him -- anything he did or said was o.k. by me .   i introduced him to people -- even after i knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked . it did n't seem to matter -- i did n't care--   --until he roped ned in . some confidence game -- and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass . 
it was n't only that -- ned was in a jam . 
you made it possible for us to get away at a few hours ' notice -- you never asked why but i guess you know . 
i came to tell you what a swell guy i think you are to do this-- 
still got my picture i see -- i was pretty dumb then was n't i chad ? 
you never fail at anything do you chad ? 
and you 've put it over -- haven't you ? 
swell -- you've got times square right here -- all but the noises-- 
looks like your old workshop back on 42nd street . 
just what the doctor ordered . 
are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know you 'll be taking piano lessons from venus de milo--   get out of here . 
am i a member of this club ? 
will be -- as soon as the ship sails . 
well that 's something -- even if only the fish can see it . 
not a chance -- i'm through . 
have you ever figured they might extradite you ? 
i 've lost my taste for knickknacks-- 
do n't lee -- that 's dead . 
--and you swear when you get to the other side you 'll never come near either of us again ? 
i 'm crazy about the kid and i got him into it .   what do you want me to do ? 
you ca n't bluff me any more . 
not because of ned . 
--you'd go with him ! 
you leave the kid alone . 
he 's all right . 
you get wise to < u > yourself</u > ! if you know what 's good for you you 'll leave me alone . everybody 's entitled to one mistake -- well -- you're mine . when the going got too rough i pulled up stakes and quit . we stay quit!--get that!--and what 're you going to do about it ? 
i wish i could . 
why do n't you leave me alone ? 
i did n't want to see you again -- that 's my privilege . 
all right -- but what is there to face ? it 's finished . 
he 's a swell person . he told me he 'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million . 
i 've got a hunch you 're going to win that bet inspector . 
why should < u > i</u > kill him ? 
that 's the truth -- every single word ! 
sure i would -- but i do n't get what you 're driving at . 
well of course i would n't take it . 
exciting was n't it ? where 's jimmy ? 
it 's getting kind of chilly on deck . if you 'll excuse me i think i 'll go to bed . good night mr. mckinney ! 
i 'll explain later-- 
i was in his cabin-- 
i 'm all right . 
are n't the roses beautiful ? 
is n't it great to be away from it all ? are n't you happy ? it seems too good to be true . 
do you think lother could have seen it ? 
never mind . 
not now toots -- which is the right way to say this ? you 're dumber than me -- or -- you're dumber than i ? 
oh there you are-- 
he 's funny -- maybe you can use him in the show mr. denby . 
oh mr. denby i wrote a poem about a bracelet-- 
oh chad -- what about the rest of the show ? 
oh all right--   see you later toots . 
is that one of the who 's who ? 
never mind the who 's who -- before i get on this boat i want to know what 's what ! how about my raise ? all i get out of these ocean trips is dizzy . 
get that out of your trunk . 
--and he has sex appeal . 
well he has a straw hat-- 
maurice chevalier ! there 's a fellow with personality . 
with your dry wit and humor-- 
when it falls off the table and turns turtle -- cute ? 
i feel better now -- i've got a riddle ! when is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup ? 
oh mr. den - n - by ! 
mr. denby -- what do you think i ought to do with that part ? 
i 'm getting seasick-- 
but i 'm not finished yet----and your waves are so colossal -- rocking boats both to and fro -- oh - h atlantic how i love you ----how i love you-- 
oh you dear atlantic ocean -- how you spread across the sea -- from new york to dear old europe -- just for boats to ride on thee-- 
somebody 's got to do it-- 
i just wrote a poem about the atlantic ocean-- 
i do n't understand . 
my man ?   you told wyatt you 'd disarmed those men .   do you actually believe after that i could see you as my man ?   you 're just a dirty little fixer . 
not now .   i do n't have time . 
absolutely nothing . 
maybe even my destiny . 
oh so that 's it ... 
a peace officer ... impressive man 
the man dealing faro .   who is he ? 
do n't worry wyatt .   my family 's rich . 
wyatt !   my god ... 
i have to go . 
i forgave you the moment you said it . 
you know you do n't have to sneak . you could stay with me .   i know things wyatt .   sweet things .   i could make you so happy . 
you feel bad about this ?   about me ? 
so i assume we 're regarding this as just a kind of interlude . 
i hate sadie . 
and i 'm josephine sarah marcus . my friends call me josie . 
and i do n't even know your full name . 
i must say this certainly has been an unexpected little windfall . 
you know this is adultery .   you burn in hell for that . 
i know me too .   what should we do about it ? 
what 's wrong ? 
oh look i have n't got time to be proper i want to live .   i 'm a woman i like men .   if that 's unladylike then i guess i 'm not a lady .   at least i 'm honest . 
well he 's handsome and he 's charming .   he 's all right .   for now .   do n't say it i know i 'm rotten .   i ca n't help it .   i 've tried to be good but it 's too boring . 
see ?   you 're laughing again .   but that 's what i want .   go places and move and never look back and just have fun .   forever .   that 's my idea of heaven .   need someone to share it with though . 
room service . 
just does n't that 's all . 
does n't suit you . 
just answer . 
nothing ... tell me what do you want out of life ? 
of course i 'm always happy . unless i 'm bored .   that blonde woman is that your wife ? 
you 're a little touchy about it . 
yes but how often ?   tell me are you happy ? 
would n't you ?   you 're laughing !   i was sure you never laughed . 
fun though was n't it ? 
that was lovely ! 
i have a better idea let 's run it out of them ! 
oh ...   now she 's starting .   how do they know ? 
what is it ? 
wyatt earp i know .   i was beginning to think we 'd never meet .   this is fortuitous .   that means lucky . 
will you go to her and tell her right in front of me she 's nothing to you ?   right out loud so i can hear ?   tell her she 's nothing tell her she 's nobody just dirt ?   will you do that ? 
you know nothing .   what you do n't know would fill a book .   jesus i feel like it 's when you 're around i need it most .   you 're never yourself you never relax .   never . everything 's so stiff and dead . you always have to keep a rein on everything ever yourself .   oh you smile sometimes i 've even seen you laugh .   but there 's no light in your smile for me wyatt nothing to keep me warm . and i get cold wyatt .   i get so cold .   what 's between you and that jew woman ? 
admit what i 'm an opium fiend ? no wyatt i just said i need it . i need something to keep me warm at night . 
i need it . 
thought you swore you 'd never carry that thing again . 
wyatt what 're you talkin ' about ? 
sure i 'm sure .   what is this ? 
i do n't know .   i 'm all right . 
i know what i 'm doing .   where have you been ? 
just go .   it 's all right .   wyatt really .   work well . 
no no i do n't want to keep you . 
oh all right . 
no stay .   please stay with me . 
you get lonely ? 
long as i live i 'll never get used to that sound . 
i think i 'll just lie down awhile 
wyatt i could n't find a single store that had laudanum any- 
and what lesson have we learned from all of this babe br ... sam ... i mean samuel ? 
do you think you won ? 
you were in hell ? 
like muddy waters ? 
like a veil has been lifted ? 
i 'm okay . go back to your friends . 
why in the h ... 
he is just being like all parents concerned about the ones they love . 
we could borrow on that land and put the money to work . 
i told him we might not need it if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property . 
you would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean . 
i would like to finish reading this . what would i talk about ? i have n't read this month 's almanac . i do n't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes . they pride themselves in making life hard and that 's not my cup of tea . 
how old are you ? 
coffee is bad for anybody especially for a child . 
i want sunny to have an advantage that you and i never had but he needs discipline and you are not helping when i tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it . 
because you were spoiled do n't try to spoil sunny . 
junior 's wife kept her afterbirth ' in the refrigerator . that 's why i do not eat over there now . 
no . no . no . no . i had my child at cedars and sinai . and that ai n't no county hospital . you have to have cash or check before you come in the door . 
i thought you were n't old fashioned . 
what 's a toby ? 
i think he wants to see your rabbit foot . 
you do n't act like the rest of gideon 's friends . they believe if you are not hard at work you are hard at sin . 
i do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start . you have no right to complain to us about your not having enough .   you sit right there with your no manners self . 
do n't make me raise my hand to you . you have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction . 
have you lost your mind ? have you thought about your wife and child not to mention your sick father ? and i need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling . 
i 've heard some foolish things in my life . 
what for ? 
well you look better than you did yesterday . 
this does n't make any sense ; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air . 
who is it ? 
i do n't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell . this cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at . 
i do n't want to hear any tales about colored people ... 
i do n't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell . you 're being irreverent . 
it 's healing now . 
i cut it on an old rusty knife . 
since this morning . 
you better come sit down . you are still sick . 
i need to get out there and get those weeds out . 
you must have been really sick . 
you stay inside . i will see to them . 
just stay in bed and rest . 
no . before anyone moves you two shake hands and do n't carry it any further . 
gideon do n't say things like that . 
you better be careful . you 'll get a stroke arguing . 
do you want your coat ? it 's cold out here . 
it would be nice . 
you know babe brother 's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them . 
you 're going to find yourself on the floor . 
you and babe brother are so much alike ... 
you all act like two roosters . 
go back to sleep . 
let us settle this tomorrow . 
do n't bother the poor boy . it just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are . 
everyone is gone . rhonda is in the bathroom . 
only if you are a good man a friend . are you a friend ? 
i 'm glad you brought that up as to who you are . i have to know who is in my house . 
hattie is a different person now . 
you must have done something to her . 
good afternoon to you . 
as long as he keeps his throat clear he is able to get some rest . 
let me get you a cup ? 
can you watch gideon for a while ? one of the girls is going into labor . junior is going to drive me over . 
he has never gotten rid of the malaria . he is usually up and at it the next day . i 'm going to make him fresh chicken broth . 
he was n't able to get out of bed today . 
tolerable well . 
she has a fish bone caught in her throat . could all of you go in the other room ? gideon get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil . 
harry you know everything . 
i have someone i want you to meet . 
i was afraid to go to marcus bottom because of him . 
those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person . 
one can tell you are from back home . these people nowadays do n't know what manners are . 
you should go back and rest . 
stranger my foot it was my grandmother who helped you into this world . 
what must i do ? 
i ca n't accuse him just dry long 80 . 
i asked harry about it . he did n't own up to it . he said he did n't know what got into okra . 
you know okra asked me to marry him the other evening . 
i remember harry always trying to help someone . he got lulla 's daughter out of trouble . he was always running to the store for someone who could n't leave the house . 
no but i might have some indian chief tonic . 
i planted a row just for you and you do n't owe me anything . 
i know you did n't but you have been so thoughtful . 
it is so considerate of you . 
how are you ?

oh great you found them .   where were they ? 
what ?   what is it ? 
oh do n't worry honey i 'm sure we 'll find woody and buzz before we leave tomorrow . 
i looked everywhere honey but all i could find was your hat . 
oh i 'm sure he 's there .   you 're just not looking hard enough . 
where was the last place you left him ? 
next stop ... 
yeah -- when you 're sixteen .

honey i 'm sure he 's around . you 'll find him . 
well honey just grab some other toy !   now c'm on ! 
andy !   i 'm heading out the door . 
no i have n't seen him .

oh all this packing makes me hungry .   what would you say to dinner at uh oh pizza planet ? 
come on down guys .   it 's time for games !   we 've got prizes ! 
now go get molly .   your friends are going to be here any minute . 
well sure we can leave it up . 
whadda ya think ? 
everything is gone now . 
but then i had a brother and a sister left . 
i already lost everything once . 
how long has - 
surely she is older ? 
i thought she was fondest of you because you were the youngest . 
do you think we should take her up to bed ? 
nothing ... you should n't have given victoria that guinness . 
somebody could n't wait until dark . 
i know for a fact he did n't take jonathon . jonathon went off by himself . 
stop it ! 
the swan was so ridiculous . all the same it did scare me . 
i hope he does n't pick on jonathon . 
he 'll murder you when he finds out . 
you did what ? 
you < i > are</i > cold . where have you been ? 
well ... yes . all right . but - 
who 's there ? 
you 're not so old yourself ! 
do what ?   oh i see . 
what did i do wrong ? 
finn there 's a splinter in your left foot .   if you do n't let me take the splinter out it will fester . 
is that all ? 
get away from me ... 
what about school ? 
she 's not accustomed to being ignored . 
i ca n't go home because there 's no home left . 
i want to go home . 
i did n't know about the puppets . it 's a lot to take in all at once . 
it 's as though he 'd trapped a real cuckoo inside . 
mummy was scared of him i think . he went to her wedding but he was < i > furious</i > you can see it in the photograph . 
i saw his teeth in the bathroom . 
is there anything else i should know about him ? 
a sin against < i > what?</i > 
i did like the music . 
i like plaits . 
he 's a pyjama case really . 
i can manage . 
there 's no mirror . 
but you 're irish ! 
in the play . she was married by my age . and mummy . mummy was n't much older than me when she got married . well not < i > that</i > much older . 
i 'm not too young . juliet was my age . 
they 're going to fly everywhere . mean things . they should have taken us . 
' have ploughed the stormy seas - ' 
it 's all right finn . 
sixteen . well nearly sixteen . 
i 'm melanie . 
it 's the same stuff ?   from the rainy day stash ? 
did you get it ? 
i need an introduction to the obregon brothers . 
i know i made things worse .   i know that and i 'm sorry but arnie i need something from you .   something only you can help me with . 
that is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us . 
i tried arnie .   and i will continue to try . 
i 'm glad you think so but i 'm picturing a debt - ridden thirty - two year - old mother whose ex - husband is being compared to pablo escobar .   and i 'm wondering who would want to be with someone like that ? 
sometimes i wonder what i 'll do if carl does n't get out .   i 'm not very adept at being on my own .   i 've always had a man in my life .   always . 
do n't you have some good news ?   is n't there something positive you could say . 
what about legitimate businesses ? we own a construction concern real estate -- 
please .   tell me who carl sells to . 
arnie help me .   does n't anyone owe us money ? 
arnie i need money .   somebody threatened my children .   they want a first payment of three million dollars . 
how much do i pay him ? 
i am on the board of my son 's school . i had a fundraiser for a.l.v. in my front yard .   i have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman . 
arnie i feel like alice stepping through the looking glass . 
what is he being charged with ? 
arnie this is crazy . 
why are you talking like that ? 
arnie thank god . 
tell me what to do carl .   i need guidance not a fucking platitude .   i 'm not bringing a child into the kind of life i grew up with .   i wo n't do it .   i want our life back . 
how ?   supportive letters from prison while i 'm being kicked out of our home ?   do you have any idea what is happening out here ?   our credit cards are maxed . the people at the bank you should see their faces when i walk in there . i have a letter from the government telling me that anything i sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien .   our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging .   nobody will help us .   nobody will take us in .   nobody wants anything to do with us .   so tell me carl how you 're gon na make it up to me .   tell me again how we 'll get through this and maybe while you 're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection . 
we watched his father get dragged away by federal agents .   i do n't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you 're coming back ... or if you 're coming back . 
how 's david ? how 's david ? he 's terrific carl . 
i keep feeling like i 'm forgetting something . 
just watching you . 
women 's room stall two .   should we stop for ice - cream ? 
especially tiger woods .   ... actually he keeps his on the back seat . 
all the professionals keep them in the trunk . 
i 'll put this in the back . 
what are you ?   a mouse ?   get out of the car and do it .   this is your chance . 
there 's always a way .   if people get to the pope or the president you can get to him . 
when will you do it ? 
you 're kidding .   ca n't you shoot him or something ? 
i have a job for you and i do n't have much time . 
i 'm on a special phone may i speak freely ? 
you will help me with my other problem . 
that 's crazy .   my husband is on trial for smuggling . 
it should be ... it 's yours .   i want our debt forgiven .   i want to be the exclusive distributor of obregon brothers cocaine for the united states .   and i want the principle witness against my husband eduardo ruiz killed . 
fine then we do n't have a deal . 
i 'm six months pregnant .   i wo n't do it . 
every part from his ears to his accessory belt is high - impact pressure - molded cocaine .   odorless . undetectable by dogs .   undetectable by anyone . 
not in ... 
we have the ability to change the color odor and physical property of cocaine . 
my husband had been working on something he called the project for the children .   are you aware of this ? 
there are plenty of other suppliers in mexico . 
i do n't think you 're going to do that . 
my husband is the victim of an informer in your organization not ours . 
why do you say that mr. marquez ? 
yes he threatened to kill my five year - old son .   i was under the impression i would be meeting juan obregon . 
where are you going ? 
at least she 's alive . 
my leica 's gone . 
i do n't know . 
me too . 
should we bring the police into this ? 
oh it is ? 
i 'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello . 
no i do n't think so .   leave me alone give me money .   that 's what i get from our daughter .   she has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar . 
if you start in on the war metaphors i 'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole . 
because i 'm at the edge of my capabilities robert . 
you might want to pencil in a little face - time with your daughter . 
does this mean you 're going to be gone more ? 
she asked me not to . 
six months .   i found some marijuana that 's all .   and a little pipe about two inches long .   i talked with her . she said her friends smoked pot and drank -- 
we do n't want to push her away . these are growing experiences . 
i think she has to find out for herself on her own .   we have to allow her space -- 
should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is ? 
honey this is difficult but we 've all had our moments .   i tried -- 
me too . 
it 's so frustrating . 
so you know we put the case before the arbitration panel none of whom had any expertise .   superfund is just one of those words .   people stop paying attention . 
like a grateful dead concert . 
how well do you know this boy seth who was driving ?   you know the police have charged him with a dui and possession of marijuana . 
what do you think ? 
i do n't know . 
not yet . 
czar for life just like a real czar . 
honey your father knows the president . 
well he 's young and he 's healthy . 
what do you think -- i should be carrying a torch for you ? 
sixteen next month . 
that 's right : ' going steady ' for four weeks now . 
i 've got a boyfriend mark . 
so why have you told me about it ? 
unless you get caught . 
the point is you 've got to find something new . 
whatever . i mean the guy 's dead anyway . 
you 're not getting any younger mark . the world is changing music is changing even drugs are changing . you ca n't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and ziggy pop . 
too young for what ? 
smells like it . 
i would n't mind a bit if it is . 
calm down i 'm just asking . is that hash i can smell ? 
is that a promise then ? 
are you clean ? 
can i see you again ? 
calm down . you 're not going to jail . 
in that case you can do it . you were quite happy to do a lot more last night . 
holding hands ? 
i do n't see why not . 
and do n't make any noise . 
no argument . you can sleep on the sofa in the living room or go home . it 's up to you . 
right . you ca n't sleep here . 
shut up . 
well what 's wrong boy ? cat got your tongue . 
do you find that this approach usually works or let me guess you 've never tried it before . in fact you do n't normally approach girls am i right ? the truth is that you 're a quite sensitive type but if i 'm prepared to take a chance i might just get to know the inner you : witty adventurous passionate loving loyal a little bit crazy a little bit bad but hey do n't us girls just love that ? 
it 's where i live . 
i 'm going home . 
will you shutup .   i should never have told you about him . 
can you cover me for an hour ? 
simon ?   ohmygod . 
harry only has two moods : busy ... and asleep . 
you bitch . 
yeah .   you know harry . 
are you kidding ?   harry had to go out of town . 
i mean it 's not like he 's saving the world or anything .   he 's a sales rep for chrissakes . whenever i ca n't get to sleep i ask him to tell me about his day . six seconds and i 'm out .   but he acts like he 's curing cancer or something . 
where are you off to young lady ? 
dinner 's in the warmer .   tell your father i may be late . 
that 's not true honey-- 
no you 're not .   you 're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake ! 
where are you going ? 
look if you ask me everything twice this is going to take a really long time .   and i have to get home to my family . 
my husband is a good man . 
i was n't cheating ! 
no !   never ! 
i do n't know .   i guess ... i wanted to see what would happen . 
i should have gone to the police i suppose . 
not yet .   but we 'll find him . 
... you should have seen your father standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce .   he looked like such a dope . 
oh shit . 
what are you going to do ? 
if we 're on an island why are they using trucks ? 
as much as you used to ? 
do you still love me ? 
tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again . 
harry ... snap out of it ! 
what is it ? 
are you a total lying scumsucking pig harry ? 
did you pork her harry ? 
what about juno ? 
my god .   have you had to ...   have sex with other women in the line of duty ? 
are we going to die ? 
is it working yet ? 
it makes you tell the truth ? 
what did he give you ? 
do n't call me honey !   you do n't ever get to call me honey again . you understand ? !   you pig ! 
oh yeah ?   oh yeah ?   then where did i get this ? 
harry what 's the matter with you ?   tell them the truth .   we 're married we have a daughter-- 
what were you doing there ? 
harry be quiet .   let me handle this . 
he 's got nothing to do with this . it 's me you want right ? 
i 'm not wearing any . 
allison is sick in bed .   i have to go over there honey . 
what ?   oh the flat tire ?   yeah i thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there . 
i can do it ! 
i think so . 
my husband ca n't know about this . 
what do you think ?   of course yes !   what 's involved ? 
oh gee thanks .   mmmm let me see-- 
i love him .   i have always loved him and i will always love him .   can i go home please ? 
let me out of her !   right now ! 
i needed to feel alive .   i wanted to do something ...   outrageous . and ... i do n't know ... it felt good to be needed .   to be trusted .   to be special . 
i do n't know .   i guess i needed something ... 
he wanted me to go with him on a mission to pose as him wife . 
that 's none of your goddamn business !   what kind of questions are these ? 
yeah .   i suppose he is . 
harry ?   what can i say about harry ?   he 's a sales rep for a computer company . 
well maybe a little . 
he needed my help . 
three days later he called me . he told me to meet him at overlook park . 
i do n't know anything about a faction .   i just met simon ...   or whatever his name is ...   a couple of weeks ago .   i barely know him . 
i ca n't honey .   i promised allison i 'd go shopping with her . sorry . 
oh sure .   fine .   i 'll get some more gravy . 
yeah .   it was a rush thing .   they needed some documents down at the court house .   i barely made it . 
they must 've just missed me . 
my husband the hero . 
it sounds wild .   so now you 're a big hero right ?   for fixing their system . 
what 'd you do honey ? 
i 'll just be a second .   so what happened tonight at the office ? 
yeah .   it was great . 
it 's okay do n't bother harry . 
sorry to bother you in a meeting but you have to promise me that you 'll be home at eight .   i do n't want dana and i sitting here by ourselves like we were last year . you promise ? 
i need you to talk to dana .   the vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon . 
i slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks . 
it 's not okay .   it 's extortion . 
that 's fabulous harry . 
how 'd it go at the trade show ? you make all the other salesmen jealous ? 
me too . 
hi honey .   how was the flight ? 
go ahead . 
uh ... well okay then .   you sound terrible .   i 'll run out right now .   just call the prescription in to the pharmacy .   sure no problem .   bye . 
he said he was an american agent . 
kettleman barnes and mcgrath . i 'm a legal secretary . 
fuck you . 
something you obviously have a hard time doing ! 
what 's going on harry ? 
no you do n't understand we 've been married for 15 years-- 
look harry 's not part of this . he 's just a sales rep . 
i 'm helen tasker .   harry 's my husband .   and you are ? 
i just glances inside . 
it 's just that ... it 's been sixteen years since anyone but harry did that i-- 
i do n't know .   i have to think ...

well i would n't go so far as to call him nice but he 's treated me pretty decent . but i 've only been there about four days . he got a little rough with arlene the other day . 
he thinks he is . he says his mother was apache but i suspect he 's lying . 
uh - huh .

i do n't know . i did n't talk with them . the plan was for me to bump into you pick you up spend the night and skip out after you fell asleep . i was gon na write you a note and say that this was my last day in america . that i was leaving on a plane this morning up to ukraine to marry a rich millionaire and thank you for making my last day in america my best day . 
yeah that one . somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you . 
i 'm a call girl . there 's a difference ya know .   i do n't know . maybe there 's not . that place you took me to last night that comic book place . 
i 'm not a theater checker . i 'm a call girl . 
clarence i 've got something to tell you . i did n't just happen to be at the theater . i was paid to be there . 
you did n't do nothing . 
so he really loved her ? 
you mean she got a bad batch ? 
she od'd did n't she ? 
i love janis . 
you 're not stupid . just wrong .

at the movies ? 
oh you look so cute as little elvis . 
oooooh you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit . how old were you then ? 
god spiderman looks different . 
what 's that ? 
i did n't even know they had stores that just sold comic books . 
you bet . how much is that worth ? 
do you get paid a lot ? 
that 's a long time . 
how long have you worked here ? 
wow . what a swell place to work . 
because you looked like a nice guy and i was a little scared . and i sure couldda used a nice guy about that time so i spilled my popcorn on you . 
apparently i was hit on the head with something really heavy giving me a form of amnesia . when i came to i did n't know who i was where i was or where i came from . luckily i had my driver 's license or i would n't even know my name . i hoped it would tell me where i lived but it had a tallahassee address on it and i stopped somebody on the street and they told me i was in detroit . so that was no help . but i did have some money on me so i hopped in a cab until i saw somethin' that looked familiar . for some reason and do n't ask me why that theater looked familiar . so i told him to stop and i got out . 
i 'm not sure yet . ask me again later . 
i 'm sure there must be something but i do n't really remember . the only thing that comes to mind are persians . 
mickey rourke somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life like elvis 's voice good kung fu and a tasty piece of pie . 
very much . now where were we ? 
yes i would . 
burt reynolds .

what do you want to know ? 
there 's nothing to tell . 
how 'bout me what ? 
would you like to get some pie ? 
well it 's just when i see a really good movie i really like to go out and get some pie and talk about it . it 's sort of tradition . do you like to eat pie after you 've seen a good movie ?

i 'll get the tickets and meet you ... in the gift shop . 
james if we 're identified they 're going to send us someplace ... but not to key west ! 
they may be looking for us james .   use this .   you can fix it in the men 's room . 
airports all look the same .   maybe it 's ...   james !   your moustache !   it 's slipping . 
that 's what they were up to !   freeing animals ! 
i remember you ... like this .   i feel i 've known you before .   i feel i 've always known you . 
well you look pretty different too . 
in a few weeks it will have started or it wo n't .   if there are still baseball games and traffic jams armed robberies and boring tv shows -- we 'll be so happy we 'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police . 
so we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music .   so we can appreciate what we have while we have it .   forgive me psychiatrists do n't cry . 
if we ca n't change anything ... because it 's already happened then we ought to at least smell the flowers . 
shh -- do n't talk .   hold still . 
you ... you could n't have heard me . 
i could n't resist .   i was so relieved . wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them ... they better watch out for the army of the twelve monkeys ... 
no superiors !   no scientists .   no people from the future .   it 's just a carpet cleaning company .   they have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned . 
it 's a carpet cleaning company ... 
i ... i ... we need cash james . 
james ... do you remember ... six years ago ... you had a phone number !   you tried to call and ... 
well i ca n't . ... i mean ... i'm trying to .   i ca n't believe that everything we do or say has already happened that we ca n't change what 's going to happen that i 'm one of the three billion people who are going to die ... soon . 
you had a bullet from world war one in your leg james !   how did it get there ? 
what does this mean to you ? 
it wasn't a tv show !   it was real ! 
james you said he was hiding in the barn ... 
the boy in the well .   how did you know that was just a hoax ? 
you disappeared !   one minute you were there the next minute you were gone . did you run through the woods ? 
just like that ?   you were in prison ? 
okay ... you were standing there looking at the moon ... you were eating grass ... then what ? 
we 're avoiding the police until i can .... talk to you . 
james !   that 's a policeman .   pretend you do n't know me .   if he sees you ... 
you 're sure ? 
give me the gun . 
first it 's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running .   okay ? 
it can be dealt with but only if you want to .   i can help you . 
nobody is going to wipe out the human race .   not you or jeffrey or anybody else .   you 've created something in your mind james -- a substitute reality . in order to avoid something you do n't want to face . 
what made you think that ? 
see -- you can drive after all ! 
what have you done ?   did you ... kill someone ? 
you have to give yourself up you know . 
no .   i want you to turn yourself in james -- it 'll go much better for you if you do -- but i 'm not going to trick you . 
shot !   who shot you ? 
what 's the matter with your leg ? 
i thought you did n't know how to drive . 
and he told you then his father was a famous virologist . 
you know dr. mason 's son jeffrey mason do n't you james ?   you met him in the county hospital six years ago . 
jeffrey mason ? 
james why do n't we ... ? 
you did n't have a gun before did you ? 
oh jesus james !   you killed him ! 
uh no .   yes .   i mean just some scrapes ... 
who 's keeping an eye on you ? 
what do you mean -- when you were a kid ? 
does that disturb you james ?   thinking about that little boy in the well ? 
what will you do ... when you find this ... secret army ? 
clues ?   what kind of clues ? 
you 're flushed .   and you were moaning . i think you 're running a fever .   what are you doing ? 
it was n't me before james .   it 's become me now because of ... what 's happening .   please untie me . 
and i was in it ?   what did i do ? 
we dream about what 's important in our lives . and i seem to have become pretty important in yours .   what was the dream about ? 
did something terrible happen to you when you were a child ?   something so bad ... ? 
you 'd prefer that ? ... james ... you do n't really have a gun do you . 
yes i remember .   why do you want to go to philadelphia ? 
i ca n't believe this is a coincidence mr. cole .   have you been ... following me ? 
cole !   james cole !   you escaped from a locked room six years ago . 
i have to do this james .   you 're very confused . 
it 's just a shot to calm you . 
i have the ... strangest feeling i 've met you before ... a long time ago perhaps . were you ever ... ? 
james where did you grow up ?   was it around here ?   around baltimore ? 
perhaps it was a wrong number ... 
1995 is the future james .   this is 1989 . 
you think it 's july of 1995 ?   that 's the future james .   do you think you 're living in the future ? 
what year do you think it is ? 
do you know what year it is ? 
why do you think there are n't any germs in the air james ? 
you 're afraid of germs ? 
what 's wonderful about the air james ? 
a jail ?   prison ? 
you 've been in an institution have n't you james ?   a hospital ? 
why not ?   most people have some id . 
you do n't have a driver 's license james ?   or a social security card ? 
i see .   you do n't remember assaulting a police officer ... several officers ? 
do you know why you 're here james . 
change what ? 
what kind of information ? 
have you been a patient at county ? have i seen you someplace ? 
mr. cole ?   my name is doctor railly . i 'm a psychiatrist .   i work for the county -- i do n't work for the police . my only concern is your well being -- do you understand that ? 
for god sakes owen listen to me -- he knew about the boy in fresno and he says three billion people are going to die ! 
he was fully sedated ! 
i said it was bad judgment !   what else do you want me to say ? 
okay it was bad judgment .   but i have the strangest feeling about him -- i 've seen him somewhere and ... 
i did n't think i was being defensive . i was just ... 
no thank you . 
yes please .   you said he gave a name ... 
that would explain the bruises i guess .   the struggle . 
you have him in restraints . 
he 's been tested for drugs ? 
what ?   what did you say ? 
tight ?   my watch says 7:30 . 
sheriff potter . 
do n't tell him anything .   he ca n't do this . 
what do you want ? 
he killed him sheriff !   i could n't stop him !   he made me come with him . he told me if i said a word he would kill me too . 
john . . . 
i . . . 
i had a fight with jake .   i . . . i just wanted to get away for awhile . mr. stewart was kind enough to take me as far as montrose .   i 'm going to take a bus to my sister 's .   i thought i 'd stay with her for a few days . 
yes .   yes it is . 
jake .   no .   no ! 
oh my god jake no .   if it is someone they 'll go away .   or call the police .   do n't go out there . 
when did you buy a gun ? 
jake what is that ? 
i do n't hear anything .   you were dreaming .   or maybe the wind blew something over . 
how could i ?   i was sleeping . 
what 's the matter ? 
nothing jake .   absolutely nothing . 
i picked them out for you jake .   i thought you would like the colors . 
you have n't even looked at them once . 
you never said anything .   about the drapes . 
i put up new drapes jake . 
wrong number . 
jake .   i thought you would be at work dear . 
fuck you !   do you hear me john ! ? fuck you !   john . . . john ! ? 
for christ 's sake john !   throw me the keys ! 
you idiot !   you 'll kill us both ! 
someone will find me . 
john if you do n't throw me the keys then i 'll just walk away . walk away and leave you here . 
throw me the keys and i 'll pull you up . 
no .   i swear it . 
i was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up . 
it 's . . . it 's locked . 
the trunk .   it 's locked . 
john throw me the keys . 
john you have to throw the keys up to me . 
john !   can you hear me ?   are you still there ? 
i 'll get it . 
i 'm here . 
can you climb back up . 
are you all right ? 
i do n't want to go to mexico john . i want to be with you .   do n't you think i care about you ? 
but i want to say with you 
he was a crooked bastard .   he would have killed us . 
what difference does it make ?   you killed jake . 
but you said we could be together . 
now what ? 
is that the kind of girl you think i am ?   what can i do to make you relax ? 
you 're tense .   what are you all uptight about ? 
he was going to-- 
just drive . 
it 's our money .   he had no right to take it . 
he was going to take the money . 
i shot him . 
he ca n't prove anything john .   he ca n't turn us in . 
it does n't matter .   he was there and he let it happen .   he ca n't take us in . 
that 's all talk .   he 's got nothing on us .   he let you kill jake . 
damn you !   what did you do that for ? he ca n't prove anything . 
sheriff potter please .   i ca n't go to jail .   i wanted no part of it . 
john . . . ? 
had push it in .   funny thing ; it would n't start . 
i got the money all packed .   i put the jeep in the garage .   figure that way people will think maybe me and jake went away .   might buy us some time . 
john ! ?   what the hell 's the matter with you ? 
wait .   what about . . . him ? 
where are you going ? 
never needed one .   i 've never been anywhere .   i 've got a backpack . 
let him watch .   i want him to know what he 's missing . 
let 's do it here . 
if you want . 
i told you .   i knew it was there . did n't i tell you ? 
do n't yell at me !   i know it 's here ! i know it ! 
if it is n't here why would he wear that stupid key ? 
it 's got to be here .   i heard him talk about it .   he bragged about it . six steps out three left . 
there has to be ! 
do n't yell at me ! 
i 'm not sure where it is .   not exactly .   i never saw it .   i just heard him talk about it . 
i do n't know . 
what was i supposed to do ? 
after dark .   i 'll leave the back door unlocked . 
you said you could n't kill anybody . 
are you sure ?   about me i mean ? 
is that what changed your mind ?   the money ? 
i thought you could n't leave .   i thought you could n't get your car . 
because i know you 're full of shit . 
stop it . 
there is no us remember ? 
i do n't think we have anything to talk about . 
i thought you would be on your way to vegas by now .   is there something you wanted ? 
it 's not like he 's a young man . he 's had time to live . 
is it so bad ?   it would be quick . he would n't even have to feel it . 
what are you talking about ? 
john ?   john where are you going ? 
we 'd have to kill him . 
it 's not a combination lock .   it takes a key .   he keeps it on him all the time .   i mean all the time .   it scratches up against me when we do it . 
lied ?   what do you mean ? 
near as i can figure must be about a hundred - thousand . 
yeah a bird in a gilded cage . 
he 's got money .   in a floor safe in the living room .   i 've never seen it but he talks about it all the time .   more like brags .   he loves his money .   would n't think of spending some of it on me . 
he does n't give it to us .   we take it . 
i know where we could get the money . a lot more than one - hundred - fifty dollars . 
please .   i wo n't hang on you .   as soon as we get there you can dump me .   i do n't care .   i just want to get out of here . 
take me with you . 
is it pretty ? 
have you ever been there before ? 
how far is it to california ? 
is that so bad ?   it 's not like i would n't try to make him happy .   for awhile anyway .   i mean i would . . . do things for him .   i guess i 'm no good that way .   i guess i tried to sucker you along like that .   do you hate me for it ?   i would n't blame you if you did .   but maybe it 's like you said :   you just got to do whatever it takes to get out . 
it 's not that easy .   maybe you can take chances ; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please .   i ca n't .   i do n't want to be alone .   i need to know i 'm going to be taken care of . 
i do n't know how . 
all this nothing ?   i 've spent my life in this stinking desert .   it does n't get to jake like it got to me .   he does n't mind being out here . he does n't mind being nothing but a land broker .   big fish in a small pond he says .   more like a little fish in a dried up watering hole . 
i 'm still here are n't i ?   see this ? 
yeah i guess you 're right . 
depends on what you call love .   when i was growing up i had nothing .   i learned to want everything .   i wanted more than sierra anyway . jake was my ticket .   he 's not much ; he 's older than me different than me but he 's got more money than half this town put together .   i courted him .   i let him think he was courtin ' me but i reeled him in like a fish on a line .   i wanted him .   i wanted what he could give me and i would 've done anything to get him .   is that love ? 
yeah but i like the sun .   i grew up on a reservation .   the sun the desert ; they were like a religion to us .   jake 's the same way .   he loves the desert .   i guess we 're alike that way .   that 's about the only way . 
if he says that 's what happened jake it must be true . 
maybe i just want to hear you say it . 
that 's not an answer .   what is it you want ? 
you never did answer my question . 
maybe i like to find out about a man first .   maybe i like to know what he 's made of . 
really ?   and what game did you want to play ?   you carry my box for me and i fall into bed with you ? 
such as ? 
no more drapes to hang .   now what should we do ? 
i like them .   i was sick of looking at this room .   i think they add a little life . 
you can let go of me now .   i 'm safe .   how do they look . 
lift me down . 
there .   all done .   lift me down . 
it tells me what every face tells me .   everybody has a past they have a pain and they have something they want .   what is it you want ? 
come here . 
those are white words not ours . 
from my father .   he was the tribe 's shaman . 
a little of this a little of that . mostly i tell fortunes . 
i guess it must . 
thank you . 
good 'cause i liked what i saw . 
did you like it ; me watching you ? 
i 'm sorry .   i did n't mean to . 
somewhere else .   i 've never been anywhere else .   just once .   years ago .   went to the state fair .   it was nice but it was n't nothing . 
what happens if you lose ? 
you just travel around no direction no steady work .   you must like taking chances . 
where you headed ? 
you 've been around . 
where you coming from ? 
and here i 've made you all hot and sweaty . 
least you can leave . 
good luck it did n't happen a few miles back .   maybe they never would have found you .   day like today you 'd be dead for sure . 
drove into sierra ?   what for ? 
you do n't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day . 
you 're not from around here are you ? 
thank you john . 
' course they cost a little more than i should really be spending .   but damn it i do n't hardly ever do anything nice for myself .   i deserve nice things . 
i saw these in the penny 's catalog and i just knew i had to have them . you ever seen something and just knew you had to have it ? 
i just got tired of looking at the old drapes .   had them long as i can remember . 
oh this is n't my car .   it 's down a ways .   i should have parked closer . i just did n't think it would be so heavy .   i could drive up . 
it 's very nice of you to help me . that package is kind of heavy and it 's so hot . 
you should be more careful . 
what happened to your hand ? 
do you want me to carry your pack for you ? 
you sure you can manage ? 
it 's grace . 
you 're pretty full of yourself are n't you ? 
maybe i do n't want you to . 
do you have to call me that ? 
my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers . 
i 'm just going to my car . 
toby !   toby tyler leave him alone !

< u > jake</u > ... 
and i love you too . 
why 's that ? 
can you make it back up ? 
bobby ? are you all right ? 
hope is a four - letter word . 
my mother died in this canyon . 
i do n't want to go to mexico bobby ! please i really want to be with you . do n't blow this . do n't you think i care about you ? 
i was just baiting him ! bobby i had to tell him that to get his guard down . just like you told jake you was going to kill me ! 
do n't leave me . i want to say with you bobby . 
you do n't believe in anything do you bobby ? 
do n't you think i would 've done it if i wanted to ? what can i do to make you relax baby ? 
you think now that jake 's dead there 's all that money there and i do n't need you anymore and i might just sneak up behind you sometime and ... pop ! 
< u > i do n't know why</u > ! 
do n't you really want to know ? was jake my daddy ? was i fucking my own daddy ? do n't you want to know that ? 
do n't you want to know ... ? i bet it 's burning a hole in your brain just now ? 
so are n't you going to ask me ? 
he was a scumbag ! ... he wanted < u > me</u > bobby . these guys do n't let go ! even when they 're < u > dead</u > ...   you do n't know what it was like bobby . those two they were the same . 
the only deal he had in mind was killing you for jake 's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life ... no thanks . 
get real bobby . he was gon na kill you < u > and</u > me . 
what are you talking about ? 
hawaii . i 've read all about it . i 've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet . oh god . i 'd kill to go there . 
but i thought -- 
then will you take me on your friends ' boat with you ? 
ca n't we just dump him fast someplace ? 
you spent a day in superior . i wasted my entire life there . i feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders . 
you do n't know what it feels like to be free of that place . 
it should be just up ahead .   hold on ... there !   there it is ! 
i 'm not coming back . 
i got the money all packed .   i put the jeep and his caddy in the garage . people'll think maybe me and jake went away .   buy us some time ... i know a back road we can take . 
bobby ?   what the hell 's the matter with you ? 
the money 's right here ! get the key ! 
after dark .   i 'll leave the back door unlocked . 
you said you could n't kill anybody . 
are you sure ? ...   about me i mean ? 
is that what changed your mind ?   the money ? 
i thought you could n't get your car . 
because i know you 're full of shit . 
stop it . 
there is no us remember ? 
i do n't think we have anything to talk about . 
it 's not like he 's a young man bobby . he 's had time to live . it 'd be quick . i mean he would n't even have to < u > feel</u > it ...   i mean sometime in the middle of the night when it 's quiet ... when he 's asleep you could just come up behind him when he 's pounding on me and ... 
kill him . 
it takes a key .   he keeps it on himself all the time .   i mean < u > all the time</u > .   it scratches up against me when we do it . 
oh yeah . there 's nothing else with jake . he do n't trust banks . he keeps the money in the floor right under the bed . he loves it so much he would n't think of spending any of it on me . i never seen it but i know he 's got more than a hunnert thousand at least ... 
at night . he just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it . i heard him . my mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there . maybe more . 
jake hides it . in a safe . in the floor . in the bedroom . he counts it . he loves to sit there and count it . 
jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time like a bird in a cage he do n't want me goin' anywhere ... 
darrell ?   you know he and jake are ... 
please . i wo n't hang on you . as soon as we get there you can dump me . i do n't care . i just want to get out of here . 
is it pretty ? 
yeah . what do you want . life right ?   have you ever been to california ? 
after he got his divorce he forced me to marry him ... but when i saw her body i swore to her on my soul that some day i 'd get jake for what he did to her ... 
you 're sick too ... he loved to do things to me . control me . my mom ... it tore her up cause she could n't do nothing about it . she become alcoholic ... and the funny thing is-- i liked it . i liked being controlled by jake . the truth was as far out and crazy as he got i wanted < u > more</u > . i wanted to go all the way . women say they do n't want to be taken like < u > really taken</u > -- that 's bullshit -- they do . the first time he finished with me he said i was a woman now . i was 14 . then he started crying like a baby ... wanted me to hold him . it 's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years but still want to hold him comfort him ... they found my mom right down there   at the bottom of apache leap . she had cactus needles stuck all over her body and virgil ... sheriff potter said she was drunk and went insane . but i 'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident . she was born on this earth and she loved it . she was like me . she just wanted to fly away . 
it 's just such a mess . with jake i mean ... 
you 'd never understand . 
get out of town bobby as quick as you can . 
is that so bad ?   it 's not like i would n't try to make him happy .   for awhile anyway . i mean i would ... do things for him .   i guess i 'm no good that way .   i guess i tried to sucker you along like that .   do you hate me for it ?   i would n't blame you if you did .   but maybe it 's like you said : you just got to do whatever it takes to get out . 
it 's not that easy .   maybe you can take chances ; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please .   i ca n't . i do n't want to be alone .   i need to know i 'm going to be taken care of . 
i do n't know how . 
all this nothing ? it does n't get to jake like it gets to me .   he says he do n't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond .   more like a little fish in a dried up watering hole . 
i 'm still here are n't i ?   see this ? 
yeah i guess you 're right . 
i let him think he was courtin ' me but i reeled him in like a fish on a line . i wanted him . i wanted what he could give me and i would 've done anything to get him . is that love ? 
depends on what you call love . i grew up on a reservation . a patch of desert in the middle of nowhere . that 's where they stick indians bobby . that 's where they leave us to die . my brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he could n't take it anymore . there 's no hope there ... jake was my ticket out . mom and me . 
yeah but i like the sun .   i grew up on a reservation .   the sun the desert ; they like a religion to us .   jake 's the same way .   he loves the desert .   i guess we 're alike that way .   that 's about the only way . 
they hear you comin ' .   they wo n't bother you . just do n't sneak up on 'em . 
how do you know he 's still not here ? 
maybe i just want to hear you say it . 
that 's not an answer .   what is it you want ? 
you never did answer my question . 
maybe i like to find out about a man first . maybe i like to know what he 's made of . 
really ?   and what game did you want to play ?   you carry my box for me and i fall into bed with you ? 
and what would that be ? 
no more drapes to hang .   now what should we do ? 
i like them .   i was sick of looking at this room .   i think they add a little life . 
you can let go of me now . i 'm safe . how do they look ? 
lift me down . 
there .   all done .   lift me down . 
it tells me what every face tells me . everybody has a past they have a pain and they have something they want .   what is it you want ? 
come here . 
those are white words not ours . 
from my father .   he was the tribe 's shaman . 
a little of this a little of that .   mostly i tell fortunes . 
i guess it must . 
thank you . 
good 'cause i liked what i saw . 
did you like it ; me watching you ? 
i 'm sorry .   i did n't mean to . 
what happens when you lose ? 
i never played tennis . you just travel around bobby-- no direction no steady work .   you must like taking chances . 
so what is it you do mister ... ? 
where you headed ? 
you 've been around . 
where you coming from ? 
and here i 've made you all hot and sweaty . 
you 're lucky you did n't break down in the desert .   day like today you 'd be dead in no time . when you leaving ? 
drove into superior ?   what for ? 
you do n't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day . 
you 're not from around here are you ? 
thank you bobby . 
oh this is n't my car .   it 's down a ways . i should have parked closer .   i just did n't think it would be so heavy .   i could drive up . 
it 's very nice of you to help me .   that package is kind of heavy and it 's so hot . 
you should be more careful . 
what happened to your hand ? 
do you want me to carry your pack for you ? 
you sure you can manage ? 
it 's grace . 
you 're pretty full of yourself are n't you ? 
maybe i do n't want you to . 
do you have to call me that ? 
my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers . 
i 'm just going to my car ? 
goddamnit virgil stop !   do n't ! 
you sound just like jake ... i did see into the future virgil but you were n't in it . go back to your family . they love you . 
no baby you got it wrong . 
anybody hurt ? 
well he offered and i just could n't refuse . his car overheated . 
morning sheriff . got my drapes . 
like you helped her jake ? 
jake do n't go out there . call the sheriff . 
yeah i heard a key slapping against my ass . 
what 's the matter ? 
no ! no ! please ! 
oh no ! oh please forgive me papa ! 
yes yes hit me ... beat me please . 
nothing jake .   absolutely nothing . 
i picked them out for you jake .   i thought you would like the colors . 
you have n't even looked at them once . 
you never said anything .   about the drapes . 
i put up new drapes jake . 
wrong number . 
it 's like you resent us david . resent the life you have . 
that counts . 
maybe it was n't a specific moment maybe it-- 
it 's finished . i won . 
think carefully ? 
my turn .   when was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it ? 
we 're supposed to be honest . 
soft and wet by the artist formerly known as prince . 
i did n't know that . mine 's still brown . 
he did n't do anything . he just told me his theory ... it 's sad when patients get like that . they loose reality . 
oh . elijah price came to visit me at the center today . 
he 's just laying in bed . he 's pretty upset . he wo n't talk . 
you use your sleeve . 
not often but it is possible . most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits . they do n't know how long the shadow really is . they do n't know how far away the real limits are standing ... they stop out of fear . 
i was hoping you would call me but ... anyway i decided not to wait .   i was thinking it might be nice to go to dinner together . 
my name is megan inverso . we went to college together . 
yes . is this david ? 
i 've come to a decision . 
matching shirt and shorts . it was brutal . 
the mitchell barbecue three years ago . 
is there anything else you wanted to ask me while i 'm up ? ... when was the last time you wore pink ? when was the last time you drank soup standing up ? final call for strange questions at two in the morning . 
is that what you wanted to ask me ? 
it means we 're probably to tired to remember . 
... i ca n't remember . 
not a specific day . what 's this about ? 
i do n't know . it 's been a while . 
is jeremy okay ? 
i do n't want to drag this out too long for jeremy . 
what does that mean ? 
for a second there i thought you were a fanatic . 
is this a religious thing ? 
and what was that explanation ? 
any way fate stepped in and took football out of the equation . 
football was n't the kind of life i wanted ... for ten years i 'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game . and if it was n't that call it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion . i 've seen way too much of it in my job ... i can barely take it when my clients are in pain .   i do n't hate the game . i admire the amount of skill it involved and like everyone else i was in awe of how he could play it but i could n't give him my heart and then have something happen to him . and it always does with that game .   it 's not a thing many people would understand . 
... see my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together . our car flipped on an icy road . we were both injured . he could n't play football anymore .   if that had n't happened we would n't have been together . 
twelve years .

but he was called ...

i believe that to be an accurate description of the events sir ... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which ...

he 's ... he 's dead .

after after the operation when that poor girl she went in a coma . dr. towler called me in .   he told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired and he never looked at the admittance form .     and he told me to change the form .   he told me to change the one to a nine .    or else or else he said ...   he said he 'd fire me .   he said i 'd never work again .... who were these men ... ? who were these men ... ?   i wanted to be   a nurse ... 
i thought i would need it . 
because i kept a copy .   i have it right here . 
yes i yes i signed it yes . but i i did n't write that figure . 
that 's not my handwriting . 
i do .   yes . 
they lied . 
i ... yes . 
i . . .. 
i would n't do it . 
it 's a crime . 
i did . 
she said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital . 
kathy costello .   that 's my maiden name .

mrs. simmonds .

how old is he ? 
you live in the neighborhood ? 
i have to talk to you . 
what are you going to do ? 
is it over ? 
yes .    we 've all got to let go . 
you 're pressuring yourself ... 
joe ...   joe ... 
what would you like it to be to me ... ?   i i i ca n't invest in failure . 
what is your wife 's picture doing by the side of your ... 
oh yes i do joe .   believe me . you say you 're going to lose .   is it my fault ?   listen !   the damned case does n't start until tomorrow and already it 's over for you ! 
you 're like a kid you 're coming in here like it 's saturday night you want me to say that you 've got a fever -- you do n't have to go to school ... 
not if you do n't grow up ... 
maybe i 'll tell you later . 
you told me so .   maybe you 'd get some sympathy .   you came to the wrong place . 
you want me to tell you it 's your fault ?   it probably is .   what are you going to do about it ?    i thought it 's not over till the jury comes in . 
you do what you want .   you want to leave ... you want to go kill yourself ? 
well then what are you doing here ? 
and it 's over ... ? 
you 're talking like a drunk . 
is n't there something you ... 
you ca n't work if you ca n't think . you get in bed .   it 's all right . i 'll stay here with you .   it 's all right .   come on ... 
why do n't you get some rest ? 
do you want me to go ... ? 
... and is that serious ? 
what happened ... ? 
is this a bad time . 
would you like me to leave ... ?    is this a bad time -- ? 
and is that what you 're going to do ?     is that what you 're going to do ... ? 
maybe what ? 
and are they going to get it ? 
i think i will . 
what if it was n't you that i came back to see ? 
who says i 'm the one that called it off ? 
yes .   it was actually . 
my ex - husband was a lawyer . 
and what are you ?   a cop ? 
the tv did n't work . 
i changed my room at the hotel . 
still looking . 
me too . 
the big boy did ... ? 
should i ? 
how'm i doing so far ? 
i 'll give you another complication : he still is . 
i can give you one thing : he was in love with her . 
he wo n't talk . 
doctor how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this ? 
as a matter of fact i thought i might give it to you . 
no not exactly . want to see ? 
well it 's a living . but i 'm excited about this . 
oh i 'm having a wonderful time ! i 've gone back to my first love ... painting . 
what have you been doing ? 
if you want to . naturally we wo n't talk about anything you do n't want to talk about . 
oh ... this and that . 
i just thought if i gave you a drink and fed you some dinner you 'd be so grateful you 'd take me to a movie . 
did you need it ? 
since i stopped being able to get them on the phone . for a man who has nothing to do you 're certainly a busy little bee . where do you go these days ? 
bye - bye ! 
no not carlotta . elster 's wife . 
is she pretty ? 
think ?   well what do you think ? 
and the idea is that the beautiful mad carlotta has come back from the dead to take possession of elster 's wife ?   ah johnny ! come on ! 
i know . the one who phoned . your old college chum elster . 
who 's the guy who 's the wife ? 
you have n't told me everything . 
you 'll tell or you 'll be back in that corset ! come on ! 
for bringing you here . come on tell ! 
now then johnny - o ; pay me . 
the poor thing .... 
pop leibel ? sure . 
wait a minute ! you 're not a detective any more . what 's going on ? 
pop leibel owns the argosy book shop . what do you want to know ? 
pop leibel . 
oh !   you mean gay old bohemian days of gay old san francisco !   the juicy stories ? like who shot who in the embarcadero august 1879 ? 
professor saunders over in berkeley . 
easy now . 
step number two . 
stop kidding . wait a minute . 
that ! ? ! 
i asked my doctor . he said only another emotional shock could do it and probably would n't . and you 're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out . 
sorry old man . work . 
he 's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink . 
that 's skid row ... is n't it ? 
gavin ? gavin elster ? you 'd think i 'd would . no . 
three whole weeks . 
you know there 's only one man in the world for me johnny - o. 
that 's following a train of thought . 
an aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it . he worked it out in his spare time . 
it 's brand new . revolutionary uplift . no shoulder straps no back straps but does everything a brassiere should do . it works on the principle of the cantilever bridge . 
it 's a brassiere . you know about those things . you 're a big boy now . 
have you had any dizzy spells this week ? 
mmm . why do n't you go away for a while ? 
well ? ... what 'll you do ? 
ah johnny - o ... 
it 's where you belong . 
well you 've got it . and there 's no losing it . and there 's no one to blame . so why quit ? 
johnny the doctors explained -- 
it was n't your fault . 
no it 's your life . but you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day . 
what are you going to do ? now that you 've quit the police force ? 
please !   and what happens after tomorrow ? 
more than you think . 
what 's tomorrow ? 
no three - way stretch ? how very un- chic . 
i thought you said no more aches and pains ? 
no there 's nothing you have to say to me . i 'm getting out scottie . for good . i ca n't stay here . i 'm winding up her affairs and mine . i 'm going to get as far away as i can . probably europe . and i 'll probably never come back .   good - bye scottie . if there 's anything i can do for you before i go ... 
he had no right to say that . it was my responsibility . you did n't know her . i should n't have got you involved . 
natural fear . her grandmother went insane and took her own life . and the blood is in madeleine .   scottie i ask you to watch her closely . 
her mother told me most of then before she died . i dug out the rest for myself here . 
she is not my wife . 
but she does n't know about her background .   she never heard of carlotta valdes . 
great - grandmother . the child who was taken from her whose loss drove carlotta mad and to her death - was madeleine 's grandmother . 
something else . my wife madeleine has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to carlotta . she inherited them . never wore them they were too old - fashioned ... until now . now when she is alone she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently curiously ... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror ... and goes into that other world ... is someone else again . 
oh yes . you noticed the way she does her hair . 
i did n't know where she was going to lead you . 
you 've done well scottie . you 're good at your job . 
all right .   you wo n't know what to look for at first scottie . even i who know her so well can not tell sometimes when the change has begun . she looks so lovely and normal ... 
we 're going to an opening at the opera tonight . we 'll dine at ernie 's first .   which is easier ? 
scottie i need a friend !   someone i can trust ! i 'm in a panic about this ! 
i want you . 
yes but carefully . i 'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care .   scottie -- 
the speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day . where did she go ?   i have to know scottie . where she goes and what she does before i got involved with doctors . 
watched her come out of the apartment someone i did n't know ... walking in a different way ... holding her head in a way i did n't know ; and get into her car and drive out to ...   golden gate park . five miles . she sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore the portals of the past . sat there a long time not moving ... and i had to leave to got to the office . that evening when i came home i asked what she 'd done all day . she said she 'd driven to golden gate park and sat by the lake . that 's all . 
more and more in the past few weeks . and she wanders . god knows where she wanders . i followed her one day . 
i 'm not making it up . i would n't know how . she 'll be talking to me about something nothing at all and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank ... and she is somewhere else away from me ... someone i do n't know . i call to her and she does n't hear . and then with a long sigh she is back and looks at me brightly and does n't know she 's been away ... ca n't tell me where ... or why ... 
no it sounds idiotic i know . and you 're still the hard - headed scot are n't you ? always were . do you think i 'm making it up ? 
then you 're of no use to me . i 'm sorry i wasted your time . thank you for coming in scottie . 
if i told you i believe that his happened to my wife what would you say ? 
scottie do you believe that someone out of the past someone dead can enter and take possession of a living being ? 
someone dead . 
i 'm afraid some harm may come to her . 
not what you think . we 're very happily married . 
would you like a drink now ? 
i was sorry to read about that thing in the papers .   and you 've quit the force .   a permanent physical disability ? 
should n't you be sitting down ? 
i 'd like to have lived here then . the color and excitement ... the power ...   the freedom . 
san francisco 's changed . the things a that spell san francisco to me are disappearing fast . 
almost a year . 
no . but one assumes obligations . my wife 's family is all gone ; someone has to look after her interest . her father 's partner runs the company yard in the east -- baltimore -- so i decided as long as i had to work at it i 'd come back here . i 've always liked it here . 
no to be honest i find it dull . 
i married into it . 
love me ... keep me safe ... 
i was safe when you found me there was nothing you could prove ! but when i saw you again i could n't run away i loved you so ! i walked into danger and let you change me again because i loved you and wanted you !   scottie please ! you love me now ! love me ! keep me safe ! 
what are you going to do ? 
some money . 
what are you going to do ? 
i do n't know ... switzerland ? 
your accident ... 
i wanted to stop it i ran up to stop it -- 
dead . he 'd broken her neck . 
scottie please ... ! 
you ca n't . you 're afraid ! 
no ! let me go ! 
take me away ... 
i 'm scared . 
no i do n't want to go . i want to stay here . 
but why ? why here ? 
scottie why are we here ? 
where are you going ? 
no it 's all right . 
we 're going awfully far . 
ca n't you see ? 
oh ! you 're supposed to fasten it ! 
i 'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks .   and ... let 's see ... to start ... 
i 'm suddenly hungry . would you rather go somewhere else ? 
too late . i 've got my face on . 
oh no . you 'll muss me . 
is that the best you can do ? 
ernie 's ? 
where shall we go for dinner ? 
we tried it . it did n't suit me . 
all right . then i 'll do it . because i do n't care about me anymore . i just want you to love me . 
the trouble is i 'm gone now . for you . and i ca n't do anything about it . i want you to love me . if i let you change me will that do it ? if i do what you tell me will you love me ? 
ah no ! 
you do n't even want to touch me . 
i know . because i remind you of her . the one that 's dead . and not even that very much . 
no you would n't let me .   and i do n't want to go ... 
i wish you 'd leave me alone . i want to go away . 
i do n't like it ! 
no i do n't want any clothes ! i do n't want anything ! i want to get out of here ! 
it 's a horrible idea ! is that what i 'm here for ? to make you feel that you 're with someone that 's dead ? 
ah no ! ! ! i do n't want to be dressed like someone dead ! 
you want me to dress like her ? 
but why ? 
but i loved the second one she wore . and this one --   -- is beautiful . 
scottie what are you doing ? 
but i like that one scottie . 
but scottie you do n't have to ! 
i like that one . 
i suppose i could phone the store in the morning and say i 'm sick . 
why ? ! 
that 's not very complimentary either . 
why ?   because i remind you of someone ?   that 's not very complimentary .   and nothing would ... happen ... 
no ? then what ? 
oh i understand all right . i 've been understanding since i was seventeen . and the next step is as long as you 're going to see me tomorrow why do n't you stay the night . 
oh well thank very much . but no thanks . 
and what will i live on ? my oil wells in texas ? 
tomorrow m -- but i have to go to work . i 've got a job . 
tomorrow night ? well -- 
thank you again . good - night . 
oh no ! give me time to change and get fixed up ! 
well ... i 've been on blind dates before ... matter of fact to be honest i 've been picked up before .   okay . 
because i remind you of her ? 
dinner ... and what else ? 
no you do n't owe me anything . 
i told you ! my name is judy barton ! i come from salina kansas . i work at magnin 's ! i live here ! my gosh do i have to prove it ? 
listen what is this ? what do you want ? 
salina kansas ! 
i told you ! right here ! 
about three years . 
it 's a place to live that 's all . 
just a girl i work at magnin 's -- 
judy barton . 
what do you want to know ? 
well ... you do n't look very much like jack the ripper ... 
i warn you i can yell awfully loud . 
well it 's not going to work . so you 'd better go . 
i 've heard that one before too . i remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with but she ditched you for another guy and you 've been carrying the torch ever since and then you saw me and something clicked .   huh ! 
what about ? 
listen i 'm going to yell in a minute ! 
0h i thought so ! a pick - up !   well you 've got a nerve following me right into the hotel and up to my room ! you beat it ! go on ! beat it ! 
do you live here in the hotel ? 
is this some kind of gallup poll or something ? 
what for ? who are you ? 
please . because i love you .   he stares at her sees the pleading look in her eyes and lets go . she turns and walks away toward the church slowly her head bowed . he watches her go and starts to move after her . then slowly as she goes her head begins to go up until finally as she walks she is staring high above her .   and then suddenly she breaks into a broken run . 
let me go into the church alone . 
and if you lose me you 'll know that i loved you and wanted to go on loving you . 
you believe that i love you ? 
let me go ! let me go ! ! 
it 's not fair it 's too late . it was n't supposed to happen this way it should n't have happened ... ! 
please let me go . 
to the church i must go there . 
let me go . 
you ca n't . 
too late ... there 's something i must do ... 
i love you too ... too late ... too late ... 
here with you . 
i stood alone on the green searching for something and i started to walk to the church . but then the darkness closed in i was alone in the dark being pulled into darkness and i fought to wake up ... 
no never ! i 've never been there ! scottie what is it ? i 've never been there ! 
no never ! 
yes ? ! but -- 
at the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner -- 
there was a village square a green with trees ... and an old whitewashed spanish church with a cloister . across the green : a big grey wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above ... a small garden and next to it a livery stable ... with old carriages lined up inside . 
but clear ... so very clear ... for the first time ... all of it ... 
it was the tower again ... and the bell and the old spanish village ... 
i did n't wake him . i do n't want him to know ... 
no do n't go away ! 
i had the dream . the dream came back again ... 
i should have phoned ... but i wanted to see you ... be with you ... 
do n't leave me ... stay with me ... 
i 'm so afraid ...   ... you wo n't let it happen ... 
i 'm not mad . i 'm not mad . and i do n't want to die but there 's someone inside me there 's a somebody else and she says i must die ... scottie do n't let me go ! 
and so explain it away ?   but there is a way to explain it you see . if i 'm mad ? that would explain it would n't it ? 
but i 'm the woman in the mirror ! 
this part is dream i think . there is a tower and a bell and ... a garden below ... but it seems to be in spain ... a village in spain . and then it clicks off and is gone . 
no . it 's new and clean and waiting . 
i know . 
i do n't know . an open grave . i stand by the gravestone looking down into it . and it 's my grave . 
a grave ... 
no ... it 's in shadow . 
a room ... there is a room and i sit there alone ... always alone ... 
there is so little i know . it is as though i were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored and fragments of mirror still hang there dark and shadowy reflecting a dark image of me ... and yet not me ... someone else in other clothes of another time doing things i have never done ... but still me ... and i ca n't stop to ask why i must keep on walking . at the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness and i know when i walk into the darkness i 'll die .   but i 've never come to the and ; i 've always come back before then . except once . 
and you 'll go on saving me ? again and again ? 
... somewhere in the light . 
take me away from here ? 
no ! please ! please please please please do n't ask me ! 
no i ca n't tell you ! 
i did n't jump i fell ! you told me i fell ! 
no do n't ask me ! 
no ! ... no ! 
long ago ... 
the tall trees ... 
here with you . 
somewhere in here i was born ... and here i died and it was only a moment for you ... you took no notice ... 
no thank you . 
and no birds sing . 
do you hear anything ? 
knowing i have to die ... 
i do n't like them . 
of all the people who have been born ... and have died ... while the trees went on living . 
the oldest living things ? 
how old ? 
if i 've been there ? that 's silly ! either you 've been to a place or you have n't . 
of course not ! i 'm a wanderer !   i 'd like to go somewhere i 've never been ! 
wander separately ? ah but only one is a wanderer . two together are always going somewhere . 
oh yes i forgot : it 's your occupation is n't it ? 
no i just thought i 'd wander . 
i do n't know . 
good - bye . 
we have . 
i could n't mail it ; i did n't know your address . but i had a landmark . i remembered coit tower and it led me straight to you . 
no ! no thank you ! 
i enjoyed talking to you . 
oh yes ! the whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you ! 
oh yes . fine . no after effects .   but as i remember now that water was cold was n't it ?   what a terrible thing to do ... and you were so kind ...   it 's a formal thank - you letter . and a great big apology . 
i ... suddenly felt such a fool . 
oh ! yes . hello . 
no never before . i 've fallen into lakes out of rowboats when i was a little girl . and i fell into a river once trying to leap from one stone to another . but i 've never fallen into san francisco bay . have you ? ever before ? 
no ... it 's wrong . 
one should n't live alone . 
that 's a good occupation . and live here ... alone ? 
i prefer john . there that 's done .   and what do you do john ? 
i shall call you mr. ferguson . 
that 's a good strong name . do your friends call you john ? or jack . 
no you are right   i 'm glad you did n't take me home ... i would n't have known you to thank you ...   oh but i do n't know you ! and you do n't know me ! my name is madeleine elster . 
you could have looked in my car . oh but you did n't know my car did you ? 
you should n't have brought me here you know . 
when you ...   there were pins in my hair ... 
lucky for me you were wandering about . thank you again . i 've been terrible bother to you . 
oh that 's a lovely spot is n't it ? i 've never been inside . but it looks so lovely driving past . 
you like it too . 
you 're not . merely direct . what were you doing there ? at old fort point ? 
i will . you 're terribly direct in your questions . 
oh ... wandering about . 
because i love it so . it 's beautiful there . especially at sunset .   ah ... thank you for the fire . 
... old port point !   out at the presidio ! of course i remember ! i often go there ! 
oh of course i remember that !   but then i must have had a dizzy spell and fainted ! 
why am i here ? what happened ?

well oh ...

we 're supposed to have gold - trimmed padded seats now they 're telling me that there was a mistake and we ca n't have padded . 
keith do not trivialize this . 
seating problems . 
we 've got problems here . 
kiss me ... ?

do you love me ? 
i am not common keith . i am not common . i am a creature like no other and i will not be commoned ! is that to much to ask ?   is that to much to ask ! ? ! 
i 've seen it on television . 
it 's vile ! 
he 's weird . and i expect more from you . 
why ? what 's his problem ? 
he 's weird . 
he 's weird . 
i just do n't see him in the big picture . 
it 's not that i do n't like him . but the wedding has really got me thinking and ... i just keep myself opening up . crowning . and i want you keeping up with me here . 
charles moore for instants . 
i just think that at some point you 're going to have to re - evaluate some of your friendships ... 
i 'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with ... about growing up assuming responsibility of yourself . 
why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality ? 
david boyd is a big sack of hot gas . 
he 's a moron . 
i suppose boyd is the creative force behind all this . 
right before the wedding ? 
well it 's bad timing . 
it amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to vegas . 
i 'm just saying i bet those checks all found the mailboxes . 
i bet you did n't forget the bachelor party checks . 
you know how important this is to my mother . you know that . 
do n't you put this on me . do n't do it do n't do it do n't do it do n't ... 
do n't you dare . 
i 'm working my ass off here . i 've taken care of absolutely everything keith . 
what else have you forgot ? 
you ca n't play around with these tent people . 
why did you forget the tent check ? 
you forgot the tent ? 
hotel for my parents the tent the band the judge ... 
the wedding cake check ? 
what do you mean you think so ? 
did you send in all of the deposit checks ? 
why is this kid staring at me ? 
ca n't we do it on the phone ? 
why ca n't we do it through the mail ? 
this is ridiculous . 
we 're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar . acoustic . 
we do n't think so . i mean we just want the singing when i come out . 
a mutant species . 
the stone age . 
... embarrassing shameful ... 
that 's our plan . 
we will . 
we 're in no hurry . i think we 'll take some time to enjoy each other enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids . 
i love it . i just love love love love it . 
you disgust me ... even if what you say is true . 
i 've listened to you long enough . let me out . 
let me pass ! 
go away ! leave me alone . 
you 're lying . 
do n't go ! 
you must be out of your mind . i 've been so happy these last few days -- now you 've spoiled it all . 
uncle you must n't think that i wo n't be sad to leave you . 
was n't that cowardice ? 
no uncle and now i 'm pleased to have been able to do this favor because although i did n't think so at first you are really a good man . 
i do n't like masquerading but as you see i decided to give in to your whim . 
today i can refuse you nothing . 
whatever you like . 
thank you uncle . 
no uncle ; ashes mean penance and death . 
no but what a pity life is like that . 
and this innocent child . 
how could anybody behave like that ? 
do n't you ever see him ? 
oh some years ago i heard my mother talking about it . but is it true ? 
nothing . i did n't say anything . 
only because you want it . 
i 'm going to make you a nun 's cake . it will make your mouth water . 
i know uncle you 've told me that already . 
come down . 
who is she ? 
you 've been neglecting the farm uncle . 
to tell you the truth not very much . i can not lie . i respect you and i am grateful to you because i owe you everything materially but otherwise ... 
no . mother superior told me to come . 
a very short while uncle . i 've been given permission to stay only a few days . 
excellent . what a charming peaceful place uncle . 
yes uncle . how are you ? 
ramona ! ramona ! 
but why ? why ? 
my god what have you done to him ! 
that does n't matter ; i like it . 
it 's very good . 
do you have great devotion for the virgin ? 
is she coming back ? 
and ... your friend ? 
yes . why ? 
i 'll be ready . 
are they going to work here too ? 
i 'm not sure yet . i 've had a shock recently and i 'm only beginning to get over it . perhaps i 'll go back to the convent one day . 
i know perfectly well how little i can do . what i want to do is give passing beggars a roof some food and a bit of human warmth . 
do they worry you that much then ? 
leave him alone . 
i 'm not like you you have your wife . 
i know that you used to work with an architect . 
i 'm not interested . do what you think 's best . 
i do n't know anything about these things jorge ... 
well ... is it so urgent ? 
jorge . you frightened me . what 's happening to you ? 
i 've been expecting you ; i got a letter from the lawyer . 
are you jorge ? 
stop this ! 
do n't say that . 
are your parents alive ? 
hold your arm out . you ca n't hope to be cured quickly . you heard what the doctor said . if it had been seen to in time ... this 'll take time . but with the help of god we 'll pull through . 
how are you today ? 
i 'll take him to the doctor tomorrow . come on now sit down and go on eating . and you look after him as if he were a sick brother . be understanding . now finish eating and then go to bed . everyone in bed by eight o'clock ! 
are you sure it is n't contagious ? 
why not ? 
is anything the matter mr. mayor ? 
i ca n't do anything to make you stay ? these people annoy you is n't that it ? 
you have decided to leave moncho . 
in you go ! moncho lead the way !   you stay here . 
what 's going on moncho ? 
have you repaired the windows of the dormitories ? 
forgive me if i have offended you . 
i have nothing to reproach myself for . all i know is that i 've changed . with all my strength which is not much i will follow the road that the lord has shown me . one can also serve outside a convent . 
i had so many things to think about ! 
i have no desire to see the world again but if you order me to ... 
but why does he want to see me ? he has never bothered about me . 
i do n't want to leave the convent mother . 
i hardly know him . i saw him only once some years ago . i ca n't even remember him . 
all right mother . 
if you want to stay you 'll have to exercise a little self - control and be a bit more humble to everybody . 
would you mind telling me what i did wrong to you to deserve your insults ? 
do n't talk like that ! 
good then let 's go ! 
give the little girl to me . come here sweetheart . are you ready ? 
that 's enough .   go join the others and do n't come back here .   and you 'll have to control your temper . 
do n't pay any attention to him . it 's very good . 
that 's all right ; we all laugh here but not at you ; i 'll see to that . 
what about you manuel ? 
right let 's go .   and keep the compliments to yourself . i do n't like them . 
have i slept long ? 
what happened to me ? 
i have a headache . 
ah ! pleased to meet you . 
i 'm going to the hen house . are you coming with me ? 
it 's very wicked to spy . why did you do it ? 
how did you see me ? 
could i trouble you for my glass of milk ? 
good morning rita . how are we today ? 
got it . 
i do n't set policy .   you have the key ? 
i need your help-- 
there is no way parker killed those guards . no way . 
captain i 'm afraid of how smart sid 6.7 is .   but i 'm even more afraid of what 's he 's becoming . 
i 'm not sure . my guess is that 's what sid wants us to think . 
i should have told him . 
until we know what new influences are affecting him we ca n't be sure . 
any sign of lindenmeyer ? 
the man played judge jury and executioner with eight people 's lives . he lost control and is capable of doing it again . 
letting a lunatic like parker barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse . at some point he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator . the risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous . 
what 's the assignment ? 
ms. deane you wanted to see me ? 
then fix it . 
talk so i can understand . 
turn it down ! 
show me his physical sensory level . 
what 's wrong with parker ? 
what do we do now ? 
i could n't tell you . 
lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had ... 
i do n't know . 
my guess is dead . 
more or less . 
you okay ? 
that 's why i 'm asking . 
you 've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon . you stopped sid 6.7 and you 've got his module . you 're free to go  right now .   why are you going to do this ? 
can i ask you something ? 
find out anything ? 
i 'm not sure ... on the bridge ... the guy at the payphone ... 
that or living through him ... 
if we find sid lindenmeyer wo n't be far behind . 
sid 6.7 is n't grimes . 
the rally 's a little obvious as a target do n't you think ? 
i was wrong .   and i was wrong not to tell you grimes was part of sid . i should have told you . i wo n't make the same mistake again . 
you 're not capable of it . 
how did you find out about the toxin ? 
he did n't know about the neural toxin .   i did . 
we know you did n't kill those guards . 
no ! grimes is n't back . he 's only one part of sid . sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than grimes ever was .   get a hold of yourself ! 
parker - stop ! stop ! do n't make me shoot you 
which way ? 
you could have just flashed him your badge you know ? 
it 's not just sid 6.7 's performances that are increasing . stars need bigger and bigger audiences .   whatever sid is going to do next it 's going to involve media . 
i do n't know yet . what we do know is his performances are increasing in scale not decreasing .   whatever it is he is n't finished ... 
whatever he was doing here was only the start . 
i 'm doing the best i can ! 
this is n't a game parker ! 
enjoying yourself ? 
what did you do to those people ? 
what the hell 's going on ? ! 
do n't get out of the car . 
i ruin so many moments by analyzing them when i should just be living them . 
dammit i hate sounding so clinical all the time . all i meant to say was i thought you were doing well but then i ... 
you know considering you 've only been out of prison for seven hours you 're readapting quite well .   wait i did n't mean that the way it sounded . i meant ... 
what i do know is that whatever he 's becoming sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before . 
now that he 's in the real world there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality . sid is going to evolve . 
sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming . 
i told you it was on the way and i wanted to change clothes . 
thank - you .   her name is karin . 
i prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life . 
how did you get your hand out ? 
and i 'm going to make sure of it .   give me your wrist . 
give me your wrist . 
in order to find him we have to understand what makes him tick ... 
dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week . kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory .   we need to get a look at sid 6.7 's final profile . 
as a matter of fact it is . 
but rather than selecting pieces from each individual he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones . 
lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain . 
he 's part of the mix . sid 6.7 is a composite . 
who said that ? 
i am impressed . 
i am the demon from the bottomless pit ... 
the government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho . 
remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids ' brains ? 
i 'm still working on it . 
this lindenmeyer 's a real piece of work . 
checking my pulse . it 's elevated .   you enjoy frightening me do n't you ? 
you 've got a problem with me carrying a gun ? 
every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers .   stay here . 
he had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight . lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17 . all he did day and night was play the violin . 
i 've spent over 50 hours interviewing him .   charlie killed leno and rosemary labianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered sharon tate . after seeing the blood bath on television he wanted to show them how it should be done .   the question is what does charlie have to do with sid 6.7 ? 
whoever did this wanted to do charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done . 
he was reenacting charles manson 's labianca murders . 
you ready for this ? 
you all right ? 
it was n't a lie . 
what you need is a collar . 
i need to know what snapped in you . what made you capable of it . you have to make me understand . 
it was just like before was n't it ? was n't it ?   but you are making progress . instead of killing seven people to get the one you 're after this time there was only one other person involved . 
you did n't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger . but i did .   you kind of liked it did n't you ? that thrill of going over the edge again . of taking out an innocent bystander or two as long as you got the target ... 
what was going through your mind when you killed the busboy ? 
that 's not true parker . 
i know . i was there . i saw the whole thing .   if i was your therapist i would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation . 
in other words par for the course .   how do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday ? 
no i just like the effect a tape recorder has on you .   how you feeling today ? 
he 's < u > dead</u > .   he 's < u > dead</u > .   the fella killed old shoe . 
what are you talking about ? 
... the harvester ... 
i 'm concerned about the driver of the rig . 
but how do we explain the fact he was in prison ? 
... how do we explain that ?   with the world watching . 
you ca n't tell this story .   he 's not kidding you .   you ca n't tell this story .   < u > you</u > knew that .   the pay off was you get to be ambassador or ... 
... his triumphal plane .   shot down .

john levy staff and amy cain press off .... 
as are we all and i 'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the security of the country would be ill- served by any any ... any ... 
and i take this < u > opportunity</u > to suggest that equally i admit to < u > nothing</u > and that i would like my lawyer present . 
i was acting as a private citizen .   nothing that i 've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe i am connected with .   or in whose < u > employ</u > ... 
i 'd like to mention a few < u > names</u > who ... 
oh migod . 
you 're just the president of the company what do you know ? ... come on . 
gekko asked us into the bluestar deal . we 're reviewing the timetables wanna come ? 
alright ... i just wanna slow down bud ... no more calls for awhile no lunches ... we suspend our business alright ... 
... got a strange call from the sec . they asked to see my records ... bud this is a heavy ... 
all right bud ... let 's do it . 
too much to do ... but i 'll walk you out . 
... and if i did what 's in it for moi ? 
yeah right ... 
come on buddy you would n't want to got me disbarred now would you ? 
what was that ? 
ca n't complain . got a house in oyster bay . market treating you good ? still seeing that sexy french gal ? 
fox bud d. is this deja vu or has it really been a year . you 're not hitting me up for nyu are you ? 
i figure a guy who 's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who 's made some of her own ... 
you may not believe this bud but i really do care for you . i think we could 've made a good team ... but that 's how it goes ... 
you 're not exactly pure bud you went after gekko with the same vengeance you went after me . look in the mirror before ... 
i 'm not looking to just survive . i 've been doing that all my life . 
are you mad ! why are you doing this ! we 're so close the town is going to be ours . do n't throw away your future bud ! 
do n't cross gordon . he 'll crush you . you 've worked hard to get where you are . if gordon does n't buy bluestar someone else will ; and who 's to say they wo n't do the same thing . 
buddy it 's not your fault and it 's not your decision . 
i 'm sorry . i was afraid something like this could happen . 
so did i till i hit 19 and found i had all the royal habits and no throne . mom got by but i had to go to work just like you . only the skills i had were shopping and making friends . so ... that 's why i do what i do what makes you tick buddy ? 
you 're so naive bud you do n't even know . your dad took care of you . i might 've been rich when i was a kid ... but my father lost all his money ... in the seventies in the stock market at the track . he was a lousy gambler ... 
get in bed . y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week ? you 're turning into a yuppie frankenstein you love money so much . 
... are you going to trade all night again ? you got to go to work in a couple of hours . 
i 'll let you know . 
do you think you 're ready ? 
you got it all charted out do n't you like a stock projection . 
let 's get things straight bud . i 'm not going to take a cut . i worked hard and you ca n't decorate a room in new york for less than $ 100000 . curtains alone ... 
... is n't it perfect ! 
i do n't . 
... a turner a perfect canary diaiaond ... a lear jet ... world peace ... the best of everything ... 
you have modest wants . i like that in a man . 
so how did your conference go with gordon ? 
if i could have anything ... this would almost do . 
he 's not a racehorse bud he 's a jumper . 
you really do believe in destiny ? 
i guess this must be destiny alright . my first yuppie apartment and ...   my first yuppie . 
what if i have a previous engagement ? 
oh really . home of the exposed brick wall and the   houseplant . 
where is it ? 
you got it a great spender of other people 's money . 
not really . i 'd say that gordon is one of the most astute collectors around . he has a great eye and he only buys the best . like this rug for instance a silk tabriz the finest of its kind . the day after he bought it in london a dealer representing the saudi royal family offered him twice what he paid . it absolutely makes the room . see how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa ... although ...   i do n't know if i would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy . and it 's a sacrilege having that pre - columbian pot in the center of the coffee table . some dope might use it as an ashtray . 
sure you could in wildwood new jersey . if you sold this   you could have a pretty nice penthouse on fifth . but you would n't have much left over for decoration . 
oh really ?   well i guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last june . 
i 'd give anything to have this in my house even for a week . 
aha . poet or philosopher ? 
oh yes i remember you . 
excuse me . 
you 're really twisted gordon . you 're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there 's a poverty that every last dollar in the world wo n't fill . 
maybe it does . do n't patronize me gordon . 
i can't ... and i wo n't . 
because i do n't want to see him hurt . 
i want to ask you a big favor gordon . please drop the bluestar deal . 
no are you crazy ? and i do n't want him ever to know . do you understand ? ... 
it 's over you gordon . 
it 's not puppy love gordon . anyway buddy and i are splitting up . 
those days are over gordon . they were over a long time ago . 
then we both are . 
did you ? 
i started seeing things . 
it got so bad your father almost had to put me away . 
i miss you . 
listen to me .   the one thing in life that i definitely do n't regret ... is the choice . i made to be your mother . 
he loves you very much .   he just-- 
that 's not true . 
no he would n't . 
that was very good . 
of course you will . 
i know that . 
do you have a scarf ? 
that he doesn't ... see me or you know that i'm ... that 's something 's wrong ... with me . 
last year .   i drove my car up a tree . nothing serious this ...   ... a minor concussion .   but the car looked bad .   it could have been bad .   i think it scared the hell out of norman . 
me ?   no .   well in the accident i was injured but ... 
i felt ... pain .   that she 'd been hurt by someone .   this is great .   i 'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my-- 
i do n't know i 'm very confused right now . 
maybe .   i do n't know .   i just know that when all this was happening i felt some part of me felt ... alive .   like somebody needed me .   and the more i reached out to it the fuller it became . 
is n't there something called group hysteria ? 
yes but ... 
what 's happening to me ? 
are you humoring me ? 
you think that 'll help ? 
what do you think i should do ? 
um ... i'd rather not say ... just yet . 
pretty .   she 's a blond .

she finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio ... she likes rock and roll . angry rock and roll .

you 're joking . 
because i do n't know because sometimes ... sometimes i forget things ... and ever since caitlin left ever since my daughter left for school there 've been ... i fainted and ...   why is this so hard ? 
yes .   i 'm sure he 's hoping you 'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace .

i 'd like to talk to you about madison . 
mrs. frank ? 
i met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night ... 
she 's making this up .

oh god ... 
we were suite mates . 
he was so pissed . 
i did n't sleep with him . 
he looked like one of the monkees . 
we know each other . 
i do n't know ... 
i guess not . 
jody he was lying . 
but he acted like he 'd never heard of it . 
what is it ? 
like what ? 
that could take days .   i need to do something now .   do n't you see ?   she wants us dead . 
i ca n't believe this is happening . 
jody she tried to kill him . 
no .   she wanted me to know the truth .   now that i do ... i think she 's at peace . 
she could have hurt me if she wanted to . 
i do n't know . 
how could i expect you to tell me something that i would n't even tell myself ? 
all of us . 
too late ?   jody it was an accident . 
oh god ... you knew . 
i 've got to find a bathroom .   i 'll call you . 
no .   jody listen to me .   you have to listen to me .   this is not something that i can do right now .   whatever it was it 's gone .   i need it to be gone now . 
did i ? 
nothing .   it was n't anything .   i 've been on edge lately .   maybe since the accident . and i 'd prefer i really would to just-- 
mrs. feur .   she 's alive .   i met her . she 's really sweet . 
jody she 's alive . 
it 's alright . 
i think so 
jody wait . 
it 's initials .   f is feur .   it 's her . 
nothing 's happening . 
i do n't know . 
the planchette ?

wow .   i 'm losing it . 
in the window .   norman 's at work . 
someone 's there . 
please .   that 's all i need . 
... no ... no ... no ... 
jody no ... 
i do n't know .   when you say it it sounds crazy .   but what else could it all be ? 
you got it . 
it 's niiice . 
oh my god .   you bought it . 
thanks but i 'm fine . 
you 're discussing me with your psychic ? 
what is it ? 
and so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club . 
okay i 'm a little tender . 
why does everyone find that so surprising ? 
good .   i 'm good . 
i do n't believe you . 
do n't i norman ?   you kept the fucking necklace .   of a woman you killed ! 
she 's out there is n't she ?   she 's in the lake . 
fine .   i 'll do the shopping . 
you do n't have to do that . 
maybe we can stop there for lunch . 
do you know it ? 
little village down seven .   supposed to be charming . 
look for antiques ... 
the leaves ... 
i do n't know but i am .   she was there and then she was gone .   i felt it . 
she ca n't be here without me . 
she 's gone . 
it 's alright . 
of course she did norman .   what else could it be ? 
she did it . 
how did she know where it was ? 
get out of my way . 
you should have tried harder . 
i 'm not going to listen to this . 
leave her out of this ! 
... oh bullshit .   you had to topple perfect daddy and that meant perfect wife perfect family ... 
what did you think i would do ?   jesus christ !   i gave up my life and my music ... 
don't touch me .   just get away from me . go ! 
so you fucked a student ? ! 
i snuck back to my car trying to convince myself it never happened .   and when i woke up in the hospital ... somehow it had n't .   until now . 
i came to work in the garden and i saw you with her ... in my house . 
i was there . 
your wife ... 
i think she 's starting to suspect something . 
why do n't you shut up and fuck me professor . 
since when ? 
what 's the matter ? 
would n't go that far . 
it 's madison fra-- 
... i 'm positive this time ... 
i thought it was mrs. feur but it 's not ... 
yes .   the ghost . 
it 's her .   this is the woman who i 've seen . 
not personally . 
what 's wrong with me ? 
but i do n't remember . 
but why ?   i ca n't understand how i could just completely-- 
in the living room ... 
when she said it there was something familiar ... but no . 
you told me that i was ... 
i felt you ... looking through me ... 
good .   you sat in front ... i saw you there ... 
are you glad ?   i 'm glad . 
no it 's fine .   i 'm fine . 
then where is she ? 
maybe you 're right .   maybe i 'm losing my mind ... 
i will not . 
no !   not sweetheart no .   i believe in what 's happening .   i do n't want to but i do .   i guess i was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you . 
norman this is n't about you .   this is something that 's happening to me .   it 's not to get even ... and it 's not some warped bid for attention .   some strange things are happening in our house whether you believe in them or not ... 
the accident ... ? 
what are you ... ?   no . 
jody brought a ouija board and we summoned her . 
jody and i.   and she was there norman she was .   it scared jody so bad she had to leave . 
we had a seance . 
yes .   and he 's going to get away with it . 
he killed her .   i 'm not crazy .   he killed her and-- 
no !   and i do n't need a psychiatrist ! 
... and i do n't think i 'm some lonely middle - aged woman cracking up . 
i do n't need a shrink . 
well that 's a relief . 
we 're going to be fine . 
you 're not at the center . 
five minutes ? 
what are you doing ? 
okay okay i 'm sure that i just ... 
... do n't get all ... 
she was lonely i talked to her .   norman i know how it looks but-- 
maybe .   point is ... not me . 
i did n't do that . 
okay .   okay .   i 'll bet there's ... look at this . 
where is she then ? 
it 's her !   i 'm telling you .   she whispered and turned on the music .   she 's trying to contact me ! 
a flare ? 
no .   look !   in the window . 
no no no no .   the soil on the shovel his shovel ... that 's clay .   it 's not from here believe me i ...   all right look at this . 
he did .   she 's in the picture .   i went over to look and she 's gone .   the table was set for one . 
he killed her . 
get down !   he 'll see . 
did you call about the feurs ? 
norman you are so funny about that .   no i did n't . 
what ?   no .   no . 
that 's just mean .   oh .   jody wanted to know if i could get her some . 
i 'm so sorry . 
that 's ... 
well that 's nice . 
you 're kidding . 
madame curie jonas salk norman spencer ... 
you are so brilliant . 
i do i do .   i 'm sure i 'm just ... how was your day ? 
i do n't know .   just ... whispering . 
it was there .   this angry music all by itself .   and i heard whispering . 
no .   can you drive me home ?   i 'll bring you back in the morning . 
in the house .   i was scared . 
there were some noises .   i did n't want to disturb you . 
huh ?   absolutely .   take your time . 
no no .   it 's fine . 
nothing .   there was ... i thought i saw something . 
norman you have to look at this ! 
i just wish you could have heard her . 
i know . 
i 'd never be able to live with mysel-- 
but what if something happens ? 
that 's not what i 'm sug-- 
to make sure she 's all right . 
not like this .   we were never like this .   i want to go over there .   after dinner we can-- 
i 'm telling you .   there was something in her voice ... 
more or less . 
of him i think . 
after that . 
i know . 
we did . 
to get my life back .   to have some time for myself .   some time for us . 
to tell you the truth ... i'm excited . 
not the focus . 
i am really . 
if you have to work ... 
excellent .   couple of swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell . 
genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms . 
three o'clock . 
it 's saturday . 
do n't . 
norman spencer . 
she 's awake . 
what 's their name ? 
i think three ... 
someone crying .   a girl .   i thought i was crazy . 
no .   but once i heard ... 
a ghost ? 
what do you mean ? 
so much . 
are you mad at me ? 
i know he does . 
yes it is .   can we please not do that ? please ?   cause it is . 
besides dad would have freaked . 
mom i 'm sorry .   i wanted to tell you . but it never felt right . 
i 'm just saying you 're going to be fine . 
i 'll come back all the time . 
it 's only two hours away . 
i 'm sorry that i frightened you like that .   but i was so touched by your concern .   i 've been lonely here .   perhaps we could be friends . 
you must think i 'm pathetic . 
i could n't catch my breath .   that 's not a metaphor that's ... and i panicked .   i never dreamed anyone would hear me back there ...   i tried to leave him .   went to my mother 's in boston .   he brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home . 
have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you could n't breathe ?   that the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave ? 
you 're going to think i 'm crazy or something . 
and these roses .   they 're much prettier up close . 
your house is so beautiful . 
very much . 
right .   i 'm sorry . 
for scaring you like i did .   when i thought about what that must have seemed like that day ... 
i wanted to apologize . 
oh god .   he 's back .   i 'm sorry .   please forget that i ... i do n't know what i 'm saying .   please ... 
this fence ... it 's so ... 
i 've never even met you . 
how ?   how can you help me ?   with your flowers and your perfect life ... 
that i 'll just ... that one day i 'll just ... disappear . 
i ca n't no no i ca n't ... 
and i 'm afraid .   oh god i 'm so afraid of ... 
he 's so ... it 's too much ... and i can't ... i ca n't breath ... 
i 'm not ... 
i 've seen you .   from the window . 
you 're the flower lady . 
who are you ? 
trust me claire .   you hear something ... change the subject .   you find something ... get rid of it throw it in the lake .   you know what happened .   the rest is only details .   and no one 's ever glad they got a hold of those .   if you want to put this back together ... just let it go . 
you 've got a beautiful life .   and even with this it 's always been clear that he loves you .   i 've come to think that 's all that really matters . 
he 's trying to put it behind him claire . you should too . 
what if he was ?   do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you 're trying to make a new start ? 
did he say that ? 
i have an idea .   but i mean i 'm just making this up ... 
alight alright .   stay calm .   you opened this door .   there 's got to be a way that you can close it . 
we need help .   please let me call the medium . 
i know . 
you do n't know that .   if it 's your belief that gives her form then you 've got to shut her out .   somehow you have to break the connection . 
if she was dangerous before-- 
what are you going to do ? 
i 'm a terrible friend . 
i got there first .   stan covered up the pills and i had it out with norman .   he seemed desperate not to lose you .   he promised to handle it .   and we all let it drop away . 
alone ?   on a two lane road ?   with a ton of valium in your system ? 
by the time i finally got up the nerve to tell you stan called from the hospital and it was too late . 
i had just been left by richard .   i was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason it made me feel better that your life was n't as perfect as it seemed . 
partly because i did n't want to hurt you ... but partly ... partly because i was relieved . 
i started to walk over ... but he was n't alone .   a blond .   i only caught a glimpse . she was young .   i should have said something right away . but i did n't . 
artsy little village down seven .   there 's a guy there who sells my work .   i had just dropped off some paintings and as i got in my car ... i saw norman sitting at this little cafe . 
i was down in adamant ... 
okay .   okay . 
and he 's the real thing .   specializes in cases like this like yours . 
yes .   now i talked to sela and there 's a guy this pakistani guy down in hartford ... 
something was there .   you saw it . 
then what was it ? 
does norman know ? 
i mess around with this stuff but i never thought anything would happen . 
i 'm sorry for leaving but i mean jesus claire ... 
are you okay ? 
i have to go . 
mef ?   what 's mef ? 
m - e ... 
we wish to commune with the spirit of mrs. feur .   what 's her first name ? 
place your fingers on the planchette . 
sit down here . 
no you 're not .   but a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly . 
i do n't ... 
just bought this beautiful antique ouija .

beautiful thing alimony .   lose a husband get a car .   think it 'll help me pick up dudes ?

it soothes heart - ache and promotes psychic wellness .   sela suggested i bring-- 
kambucha mushroom tea ... 
wow .   got here just in time .   i brought you this . 
well good .   so you 're human . 
cause ... your ... only daughter just went away to school ... who you were incredibly close with aaand i 'd be tripping ...

how you holding up ? 
did you like it ... ? looking down at graham and knowing what you could do ... ? 
but i had to use my hands .   none before you could kill with their mind .   graham my dear .   your uncle ... ? 
... and why i put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster . to kill the legacy !     you are the sum of his desires - 
and that is why i pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her ... 
witches . rowan .   that is what we are . 
just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile ! 
lasher touched you and you loved it . 
he 's shown himself to you ... on the deck .   in the storm . 
you have the mayfair eyes .    tell me rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind ca n't fathom ... ? 
antha ... your grandmother ... her life ended there on the stones . head split open like a melon . 
she did n't feel them 
put your hatred for me aside so you can clearly see what is ahead- 
you can see well in the dark rowan . 
what is it ... ? 
and this - if you decide to take the rest . 
other properties as well - here and in europe .   and vest holdings - in sugar oil gold electronics .   liquid funds over eighty million .   tmpcssible to put a figure on it all . all yours now .

a very tired one .   i 've been up all night - and i would .like to rest before the funeral .      have your lawyer - 
it was quite warranted by the - situation .     i realize this is a shock but really rowan - you never even knew her . it 's not as if you 've suffered some great - 
i had you sent away .

e11ie - diedre died at five o'clock this morning .     obviously there are 1egal matters .   your discretion will be - 
sounds good - thank you 
i thought someone was following me - i - er -   i just needed my computer and some things ... listen i 'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that ok ? 
i thought you were someone else 
i 'm sorry - i did n't think 
i heard something like that 
that 's not technically accurate - simpsons murders were n't sexually motivated . 
i 've got a tenant coming over later - can i take the afternoon off ? 
the one on the left - definitely ... 
yes - i have had it for years . 
i 'm terribly sorry - i have a bad memory ... 
oh really - you must remember me from when i was a regular customer . 
no - i 've been abroad for a long time ... 
i know what you mean - i 'll meet you at vinnies wine bar at six if you like . and do n't make any plans for this evening ... 
all the time ? 
yes i 'm sure you could - but i ca n't risk you loosing your job 
and it ca n't be forged ? 
so there is only one key ... 
tell me brian what would happen if the client lost the key ? 
its cramped in here is n't it brian 
but - if you could show me round now - and i 'll meet you later ? 
that 's very kind of you mr griffiths ... ? 
when could i look round ? 
yes - it 's about bank safety deposit boxes - i wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show me round . 
you see i am writing this article for chic magazine 
do n't you want me now leslie 
it 's what you would do to me 
you killed my friend ! 
nothing leslie - i just think we should wait ... 
i have n't been using it recently leslie 
it 's not that - i just do n't want any sugar 
i do n't like sugar 
why did you let him in ? 
he does n't need to ... 
no thanks - 
leslie ?   is that good enough ? 
i am sorry ... 
leslie i 'm sorry - i - i did n't know what to think 
where are you going ? 
but for how long - what will set you off again ? you 'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round ... 
you want me to wear white for you ? you must be madder than i thought ... 
what is it ? 
what 's wrong ? 
nothing could be better ... 
psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons 
then make it stop ... 
what was your relationship with stephanie ? 
did stephanie kill your mother ? 
did you ? 
tell me about your adopted mother 
wonderful - like a great release - he was a malignant cancer and i had to remove him - the world is better without him 
why should i ? 
that 's right ... don't ever think that you and i are the same - we 're not even remotely similar . i did what i had to do for myself for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy . my husband was sick - 
i do n't think so ... this is n't a game you know ... there are n't points or leagues . sure i killed my husband - but i am no killer . 
what did n't you like about her ? 
then why did you marry her - 
tell me about your wife ... 
how long have you been watching me ? 
do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed 
is white an expression of innocence ? do you crave innocence leslie ? 
is ' their ' colour an expression of their inner self ? by that i mean extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white ? 
ok the press call you the white angle because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes blonde hair ... 
the press think that the white angel is a woman - why is that ? do you dress up leslie ? 
what did you do with her ? 
did n't debbie deserve anymore ? 
i do n't know 
where do you kill them ... 
you do n't know ? 
and how many people have you killed ? 
and how long have you been a dentist ? 
so what do you do ? 
i think i will pass ... 
do n't worry - is that my hammer   well just make sure that it 's put back in the garage ... 
my names is n't angela ... 
what 's with all the locks - and hammering 
what are you doing ? 
do you take sugar ? 
i lost the touch 
i really do n't know what to say 
no he had to - he 's just - he 's out ... 
i had an accident - i fell down stairs ... 
i 'm your landlady 
i want you out now 
yes i can ... 
you heard me - keep away from him 
i would prefer it if you kept away from leslie 
yes - but you live here too - if it were your house ? 
well what do you think ? 
at 2.00 ... 
i think you had better leave 
get out ... 
at home alone - where were you ? 
you think i 'm the white angel ? 
what brings the rats out of the sewers ? 
what 's this all about ? 
not bad for a hack . he has a future in yellow journalism . 
that explains the emptiness that haunts me . 
new hushpuppies do n't make a new man . 
what gives don corleone ? 
you better . 
let your fingers do the walking . 
i know where you can find an excellent editor - in - chief . 
planet ted . five years from now . what 's happening ? 
i know where you can find any number of naked girls who 'd love to hop on board . 
very ambitious . i like that . 
i 'm not going anywhere ted . you 're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams . 
keeping your word is something i can actually respect ted . 
you think you 're working with chimps here ? 
you 're telling me you do n't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts . 
i mean your pictorial . it bothers me profoundly . 
that 's hard to believe . 
maybe someday . 
trust is something you earn over time . you do n't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire . 
not a chance . 
you lose trust in someone and it 's over done gone forever . 
you live and learn . i realized the most important thing to me above all is trust . 
i had a portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me . 
sounds voices music humming . all of it can turn me on or off like a switch . 
i 'm very aural . 
that 's refreshingly deviant . 
wearing them ?   or humping them ? 
i figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy . 
my desire betrays me like goosebumps on my flesh . 
i 'm trembling with excitement . 
amen to that . 
you expected whips chains merk being cattle - prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood ? 
i got an anonymous tip and an address in cincinnati . 
well ? where the hell are you ? 
a good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade . i 'm honing my craft . 
you forget i dislike you at least as much as him . 
cut to the chase william randolph . your audience is way ahead of you . 
but you never do . 
i know . 
then you 'll see who 's really holding on to you . 
eventually you 'll let go . 
it 's incredibly simple . 
a father is nothing but sperm ted . it takes a real man to be a dad . 
your dad taught you everything . 
the ozone must be fully depleted on planet ted . 
i doubt it . 
he phoned it in . 
he did n't . he had it built . 
to the best hiding place in the world . 
put your eyeballs back in your head william randolph . i 'm on assignment . a girl has to fit in . 
you 've got enough people kissing your ass . 
second only to unbridled narcissistic conceit . 
you 're so twitterpated you do n't even see the miner 's hat and the pickax . 
and this is not my first time on a private jet so quit acting like i 'm rebecca of sunnybrook farm . 
i bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on planet ted . 
undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort . 
i did my homework . your grandfather was a peach farmer . 
life must be peachy on planet ted . 
is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release ? 
she said peanuts you cretin . 
i see . so more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist . 
could everybody else tell you were different or were you the only one who knew ? 
different how ? different like a dwarf at a basketball game ? or different like a lesbian in pumps ? 
then i 'll write about you . 
i 'm still better than you . nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account . 
just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world does n't mean you 're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago . 
ah ha ! it was so well hidden you did n't even know it was there . 
in what sense ? 
what is it william randolph ? your balls need scratching ? 
a few billion bucks and suddenly he 's cro - magnon man of the year . 
it was for your own good in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way . 
i tried to warn you william randolph . she 's got stiletto heels hidden in those keds . 
--do it . i triple - dog - dare you . 
go ahead . ask her to the prom . get it over with . 
i did n't know they gave them for best lip gloss retention during a blow job . 
do n't even tell me you 're hot for miss titty pom poms over there . 
is it true ? is ignorance bliss ? 
let me guess : retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof ! 
so william randolph . your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of rice crispie treats and chocolate snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale . 
we want you to go to college find a career you love marry a nice girl from a nice family and live happily ever after . 
we miss our family . 
do n't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family ? 
you have to understand . this was a big shock for all of us . one minute you 're our little boy of whom we could not be more proud . the next minute you 're the owner of this whole pornographic empire . 
we wanted you and jimmy to have it someday . something real and honest . 
oh honey . we ca n't accept this extravagance . 
sweetheart what is it ? 
we ca n't accept it .   it 's much too expensive . right dear ? 
we have a truckload of strawberries arriving on tuesday morning . 
this is humiliating . we 're being ejected from a prom ! 
ted ! do something ! 
teddy i thought we were having a moment here . 
after graduation ... maybe we could go away together ? 
teddy ? i was thinking . 
then remember you are the heir to a billion dollar empire . you have a staff of literally thousands . multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still ca n't even wrap your head around everything that is yours . all yours . 
or do you have a taste for the good life ted ? it 's in your blood . 
and who is ted nelson ? 
who exactly are you ? 
do n't worry .   he found the chocolate room . 
hey ted . wanna go shopping ? 
that 's me . 
i know .   i 'm ginger . miss april . 
it 's your car . these are all your cars . 
the first time can be awkward . you just have to get on and try again . 
now release the brake . and slide the stick into first gear . 
want a lesson ? 
you do know how to drive ? 
they 're in the ignition silly . 
i 'm fine .   nice tv . 
so suzie and sandra van ryan were half- sisters . 
suzie .   then you 're not her grandmother ... 
and the child ... 
was there ever any kind of investigation ... 
she still work there ? 
actually i was wondering if i might ask you about ray duquette . 
i was wondering if i could ask you a few questions . 
what if something distracts it and it snaps anyway ? 
try kelly . 
you mean he withdrew ... 
then what ? 
did you try to fight him ? 
he was large ? 
that 's okay kelly .   you 're doing fine .   but i have to ask you something here . when you say it hurt .   was this the first time a man was inside you ? 
was there penetration ?   did he put himself inside you ? 
i understand . 
take your time . 
i know you do . 
how are you kelly ? would you like to take a break for a minute ? 
you could tell me where you were last night . 
ray thinks she was murdered . 
she did n't cone home last night .   we found her car at the bus terminal but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket . 
suzie toller is missing . 
were n't you a little worried about her ... ? 
did you call anyone ?   did you call her house to see if she got home ?   did you call the masons ? 
and when you turned her toward the door where did you expect her to go without a car ? 
i 'd like that . 
it 's homicide 's job now ray let 'em do it .   i 'll tell you something else there 's more to this story than you know ray ... if suzie is dead i think hunter may be on the right track ... 
he 's leaving the country .   and i do n't give a shit . 
i 'm tired ray .   i 'm going home . 
and if the teeth are n't suzie 's ?   you 'll give this up ? 
ray you heard him ... 
we do n't know that ray ... 
her grandmother said she 'd been threatening to run away .   and i found the car at the miami bus terminal . 
where 's the body ? 
two kids could 've gotten into a fight lost a couple of teeth . 
if you want company ... 
you have someplace to be ? 
ray .   we do n't know anything yet .   she could be anywhere ... 
we all have ... 
you could say that . 
which she might have saved if she had n't set out to destroy the man 's life . 
where 'd you come up with this stuff anyway ? 
eliminate the competition . 
this one 's got you working overtime has n't it ? 
so what about the girls ?   suzie 's poor but why would kelly have to steal from her own mother ?   surely her father ... 
why ?   you ask me lombardo had it pretty good already nice job in a beautiful setting popular an active social life .   he 's gon na put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you 're describing ... 
unless what ? 
maybe lombardo 's attorney was saving the affair for the trial . 
lombardo 's settlement ? 
that 's what they called it when i was in juvenile .   it 's a pretty dismal place . 
you mean camp sixty - nine . 
the skinny brunette . 
you can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark .   you know what you get ? more bark .   and more bark .   there 's no core .   tree 's not good tar anything but sucking up water .   and now they ca n't get rid of them .   they 've tried poisons . nothing works .   they do n't die . 
all i 'm saying is we let sandra van ryan push us too hard we 're going to wind up looking stupid . 
we failed to mention the mower guy 's a drunk that he was after more beer and never really saw kelly go into the house so he ca n't say how long she was in there .   same with the kids .   they saw her running down the street but that 's it .   with no physical evidence what do we have ?   her word against his . 
same as him .   they saw her come .   they saw her go .   they saw him follow . 
hunter 's making it our job because sandra van ryan 's got a bug up his ass . you know that as well as i do .   we 're gon na trash this guy 's life and i keep asking myself if it 's really necessary . 
all i 'm saying is i think we should go slow here . 
back to the land of grownups . 
what was that ? 
at that point were you able to fight him off ? 
did he come in with you ? 
so you were alone . 
and when he arrived at your house was anyone there ? 
he dropped jimmy off first ? 
we need to tape the interview suzie . no one will see it but us .   now when was this that mr. lombardo gave you the ride ? 
why is that ? 
that bothers you ? 
you know what that will mean for lombardo . 
i worked juvenile in dade county for three years .   we had a missing persons on kelly van ryan for two weeks ... maybe a year ago ... the family kept it out of the papers . 
that does n't make him a child rapist .   there 's something else .   this girl 's had some problems .   wrecked a couple of her mom 's cars .   ran away ... 
i think she 's acting .   i think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her .   i think maybe she 's upset that he did n't ... 
not at first .   he was still inside but he was n't moving or anything ...   he said we had this secret .   and that now he 'd be able to help me ... because we were close ... something like that .   i do n't know .   it 's hard to remember exactly . 
i ... he had my wrists pinned behind me . i remember my hands were cold . ' 
no .   i 've done it a couple of times i mean with guys i dated .   but this hurt ... like he was built ... you know ... 
yes .   i said stop .   i screamed .   i mean that 's how it sounded in my head .   he hurt me ... 
they were in me .   both places ... you know . 
the next thing ... his hand was in my shorts ... you know from behind .   his fingers ... his fingers ... 
i just want to get it over with .   my mom 's making me do this . i just want to forget it . 
i think we just need to get wasted . 
anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain ? 
are you retarded or just brain dead from whiffin ' fumes out there in the swamp ... 
oh for christ 's sake . 
you can trust me . 
i ca n't believe you called sam .   what 's the matter with you ? 
yeah i 've got family and they 've got clout and now you have me .   right ?   and sam .   believe me suzie this dickhead 's not going to send you anywhere .   he 's gon na try and rattle your cage and that 's it .   stay strong and he ca n't do shit . 
will you calm down .   duquette 's gon na come to you just like he did to me . you 're gon na have to be ready for him . 
get off my property . 
police -- god -- get a life . 
you 're out of your mind . 
excuse me ? 
about what ?   how to improve your breast stroke ? 
is there some reason why you 're here ? 
a friend of mine bought a boat . 
do n't bother .   i 'm taking a trip . 
you did n't have to fly back -- from -- wherever for me ... 
yes .   god mom ... 
i was raped .   by sam lombardo . 
no you do n't . 
i miss dad . 
no thanks to you . 
my friends buy me clothes so i do n't look like trash . 
you notice my new jumper ? 
hi mon . 
um - huh .   and guess what else ?   i have toys . 
i 'm running away . 
no little girl can ever make me come . 
say you love me . 
that never seemed to worry you at the glades . 
okay .   i love you too . 
but what if they find out ... god they 'd put you in the gas chamber ... 
i do n't know .   i want to see you ... 
i do n't know ... i think it was something else ... suzie says the bust was bullshit ... 
i ca n't help it .   he gives me the creeps ... i mean why was suzie so scared of him ?   she 's not that way .   i think he did something ... 
i 'm really serious .   that cop he keeps watching me . 
god i 've been calling you . 
there was no way .   that cop would 've gotten her to tell him ... everything . she was weak and dumb ... 
i 'm here . 
you know what it takes . 
why ca n't you come ... 
do it to ourselves ? 
hey come on ... we 've got to have at least one victory party . 
of course i 'm crazy .   ask my mom . 
how much ? 
so you got my mom 's money . 
drop dead ... you know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off ? she 's trying to break my trust .   how do you like that ?   i ca n't touch it until she 's dead and she wo n't give me a dime and now she 's trying to break it to pay you ... 
mr. lombardo .   we 're running kind of late .   how about if nicole goes on to the mansons ?   you could give me a ride when you find the ticket . 
rules are rules mr. lombardo . 
are n't   you forgetting something ?   your coupon .   we got ta have it . 
where 's the hose ?   we can set up . 
look he forgot .   i knew it . 
do n't forget the car wash . 
deal .   you know i just looked out front .   my ride was n't there .   you suppose you could give me one ? 
he did say something . 
no .   he stopped by himself .   okay ? that 's all .   let me go . 
i guess . 
about a year ago . 
you did n't tell me you were gon na put me on the fucking news . 
yeah maybe a little . 
he was my friend at first .   then i got busted ... he did n't even stick up for me .   i had to go away to that hellhole . it 's like you 're his favorite then who cares ?   you wanna know something ?   when kelly said we should do this i thought cool all these big shots screwing me over like that cop duquette .   now they 're gon na get screwed . 
this was n't my idea . 
i said he did . 
because ... it was the biggest i 've ever seen .   and i 've seen a lot on their way through jack 's fish camp . 
he pushed into me ... i could n't stop him ... it hurt . 
okay !   he did .   he pushed me to the floor and he did it to me .   now can i go home ? 
shit what difference does it make ... nobody 's gon na believe me anyway ... 
i wanna go home now . 
yeah ... okay ... he did 
i wanna live at the beach someday . 
i thought we were goin' to a movie . 
what are you looking at ? 
what brain ? 
you are . 
you 're gon na fuck me over are n't you ? 
i 'm scared that 's what .   i 'm scared there 's no one to trust . 
man i wanna smoke a joint . 
yeah but he ca n't push you around like he can me .   you 've got family and they 've got clout .   with we it 's different ... with me ... 
hey ray .   guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and sam 's ? 
shoulda coulda woulda ...   get him in the water . 
shut up . 
get away from me . 
i do n't mean who you 're thinking .   i have other friends ... 
i do n't have to listen to this .   and you ca n't shove me around .   i have friends now ... 
is this supposed to mean something to me ?   what triangle ? 
about what ? 
that 's cop bullshit . 
you got something against cigarettes ? 
then he 'll be back at blue balls ? 
will they ? 
it 's celine .   he 's okay .   he had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are . 
i did .   at blue balls . 
walter .   he 's been aimin ' that brownie through knotholes for years .   i saw these i knew he 'd finally struck gold .   i ca n't decide which came out better that little straw kelly 's got up her nose or that vibrator you 've got up her ass .   what do you think mr. lombardo ? 
well i 'd need the famous lombardo charm not that you 'd have to do anything you have n't done already . 
i 've seen you out there in your old air boat thinking about what might have been old man van ryan had n't fucked you out of it .   what if i told you i had a way we could get a big piece of it back ? 
trust me the guy 's dirty .   he 'll like it .   especially the part about offing me .   now get out of here .   go make yourself a new friend . 
seems to like some of the same places you do .   funny you never met . 
fuck the winch .   i wanna drive . 
but then it is better this way do n't you think ?   no loose ends . 
the guy was history when he killed kelly .   you knew that . 
are you mad at me ? 
yeah right . 
but i .. 
how much is about six and a half million divided by three ? 
they do n't even realize they should be frightened . 
here .   mr. tyler .   he claims a certain skill at handling firearms . 
we 'll see . 
fine i 'll stop . 
i try .   please if you promise to protect me i 'll testify against him . i 'll give you an ironclad case . 
my .   it 's gotten longer . 
she 's perfectly safe . 
you 've ... done ... this ... before . 
would that include me ? 
thank you .   but the truth is i 'm a single woman in a man 's world . that leaves me very few choices does n't it ? 
i 'm not so sure dr. loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger . 
have you taken a wrong turn mr. tyler ? 
you must excuse the doctor .   no one has ever beaten him at his little game . 
you most certainly do . 
oh do n't worry .   i 've already overlooked the fact your name 's not actually on our guest list . 
yes in a way .   i 'm the doctor 's social secretary .   i handle his correspondence send out the invitations you know . 
well sir you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests . 
my ... the wild west . 
i do n't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before . 
i get that feeling .   you know mr. tyler i 'm the kind of woman who does n't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time . but after spying you across the room i 'm tempted to suspend my disbelief at least for the evening . 
bavmorda can not transform you . i 've protected this camp with a spell . 
as above so below . 
sorsha queen bavmorda 's daughter . 
i will !   but i need help ! 
he 's no magician . 
patience willow . 
time is running out . 
no !   i can still defeat bavmorda ! 
just do it ! 
get down !   the ritual chant ! quick !   protect yourself ! 
you did n't transform them willow you released them .   that was noth- ing .   now change me . 
more !   more ! 
use the philosopher 's stone !   hur- ry !   invocation !   release them ! 
tir asleen . 
no !   change me back into a sor- ceress willow . 
now use it . 
again :   what is the magician 's weapon ? 
we need blood .   to nourish the stone .   charge the stone with ener- gy . 
that 's the life spark .   exxence of magic and sorcery ! 
the art of transformation ! 
your will !   your will !   what else could it be ? 
what 's the magician 's weapon ? 
we do n't have much time left !   go on !   go on ! 
patience .   concentrate .   you will find a way . 
burn it to a fine ash . 
as below so above .   you hold the univers willow in your hand . 
till it 's in a powder .   the energy exits within you ... 
we must start with feathers dung and a lock of your hair . 
willow .   to learn magic first you must make your own philosopher 's stone ! 
then i will teach you . 
you must learn magic . 
a magician * makes * magic .   any fool can use it . 
did * you * give that acorn its power ? 
kill him ! 
kill him ! 
what do you want ! 
who are you !   who are you ! 
here . whenever you want them . 
i want you to take this ... to remember by . 
that 's god 's way ! 
what you do is take vengeance ! which is a sin against heaven ! 
there is always a way ! but you are such a ... a glotzkopp you can not see ! you 'd rather go back to that city ! to nothing ! no woman ! no children ! no land ! 
i 'm not so sure of anything as you are john book . you could live this life if you wanted to bad enough .   just as i could live yours ! 
you 're so sure of that ? 
i was being foolish ? 
there was a time when i would have welcomed it . 
there was a time when i thought you might have stayed . 
you should not bother with that birdhouse .   if you 're leaving tomorrow . 
i see .   but i hope you have a lot of sugar .   eli is ready to go to zook 's . 
when will you be going ? 
but ... you may not be well enough . 
i 'm sorry . i 'm sure it is . 
whacking is not of much use on a farm . 
what else can you do ? 
you know carpentry ? 
we had some lemonade and he left . 
eli is a fine carpenter . best in the district . he and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago . 
oh . the bullets . 
you can go with eli . he 's taking samuel to school . but you 'll have to hurry . 
but stoltzfus said ... 
well ... the store at saltzburg ...   but you wo n't be going to saltzburg for a while . 
telephone ? the gunthers across the valley . they 're mennonite . they have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even . 
you make fun of me . like the tourists . driving by all the time . some even come into the yard . very rude . they seem to think we are quaint . 
vain . proud . such a person is hochmutsnarr . he is not plain . 
buttons are hochmut . 
i should tell you these do not have buttons .   see ? hooks and eyes . 
yes . it 's good that someone can have the use of them . besides in your clothes you 'd stand out to strangers . 
your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood . i have them soaking . you can wear these . 
enjoying your reading ? 
it 's not the gun . do n't you understand ... it 's you . what you stand for .   that is not for samuel . 
john book i would appreciate it if during the time you are with us you would have as little to do with samuel as possible . 
you tell him . when you 're able . 
but you ca n't . 
two days . 
only the elders . 
the leadership of our district ... the diener . bishop tschantz is the one with no hair on top . they decided to come and see you for themselves . except stoltzfus of course . he came the first day . i think he saved your life . 
but why ? 
but john ... why did n't you go to a hospital ? 
what about samuel ? will you come back to take him to trial ? 
stay for awhile . rest . i 'll make coffee and breakfast . 
you said we would be safe in philadelphia . 
you could n't wait until morning ? 
where are you taking us now ? 
i 'm afraid . i 'm afraid for samuel . i want to go home . 
but why would they murder ... 
why do n't you arrest that man ? are you protecting him because policeman ? 
oh yes . she thinks you like policing because you think you 're right about everything . and you 're the only one who can do anything . and that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a ... um ... bag of elbows . 
she thinks you should get married and have children of your own . instead of trying to be a father to hers . except she thinks you 're afraid of the responsibility . 
your sister said you do n't have a family ? 
but not a good tired . 
i would not be too sure . 
no you 're not    you 're glad because now you 've got a witness .   i heard the other police talking last night .   they do n't seem to like you very much . 
we do not go into your courts . 
yes . and i also want to leave this city . 
the problem is i do n't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people . 
he wants to know who you are . your name . i told him we do n't need to know anything about you . 
it 's not a joke . 
you do n't understand we have nothing to do with your laws ! 
you have no right to keep us here . 
where are you taking us ? 
samuel . samuel lapp .   but what happened here is none of his affair . my sister is expecting me ... our train is leaving soon . 
you just would n't . it 's not the amish way .   but i think it would have done me good if i could have screamed at your brother last night . 
at home you 'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way . 
fred . the way he looked when you screamed at him . 
i made it a contest ... the one who does best gets his cereal back first .   children like to help ... they only need to be kept after a little bit . 
just a minute . i 'll pour you some coffee . 
i wanted to . you were kind to take us in last night .   anyway i needed something to do . i was so angry with your brother . he 's so ... agaanisish ! 
good morning . 
yes thank you very much . 
i have to help him ! 
you shame yourself . 
i will be the judge of that . 
i am not a child . 
that is idle talk . 
i have committed no sin . 
i have done nothing against the ordnung . 
eli john is a carpenter .   as well as being a fine policeman . 
i know god help me i know that eli .   but i tell you that if he 's found here the people who did this to him will come for samuel . 
we 'll pray that he does n't die ! but if he does then we 'll find a way so no one knows ! 
i know . 
his name is john book . 
yes . samuel ! we 're going . 
john lost control of himself . he ... will be repentant . 
he 's from ... ohio ... my cousin . 
my son is out there ! 
you might have killed him ! 
you have no right here ! 
no you listen . get out !

it 's beautiful is n't it ?   just like i knew it would be .   he really must be a wonderful wizard to live in a city like that ! 
a home -- 
well of course not .   my goodness what a fuss you 're making .   well naturally when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- why you 're nothing but a great big coward ! 
it 's bad enough picking on a straw man but when you go around picking on poor little dogs -- 
no but you tried to . 
why zeke -- you 're just as scared as i am ! 
oh hunk you just wo n't listen that 's all . 
i have so got brains . 
ohh !   ohh !   ohh ! 
did you just hear what i just heard ? 
oh -- oh -- 
oh -- and i was so happy !   i thought i was on my way home ! 
dear whatever shall we do ? 
oh he 's been crying ! why have you been -- 
oh -- here quick -- oh ! - we 'll oil him up . 
oh no -- please .   i have to rest for just a minute .   toto ! 
i do n't see why not .   why do n't you come along with us ?   we 're on our way to see the wizard now . to get him a heart . 
do -- do you suppose we 'll meet any wild animals ? 
i do n't like this forest !   it 's -- it 's dark and creepy ! 
oh you 're the best friends anybody ever had !   and it 's funny but i feel as if i 've known you all the time .   but i could n't have could i ? 
... just that the witch is so wicked . i do n't think you two ought to come with me because you 'll get into trouble . 
and i 'll keep the oil - can handy . 
yes --- there . 
here -- here -- 
oil can ?   oh -- oh here it is ! 
yes .   oh -- look -- 
why it 's a man !   a man made out of tin ! 
oh dear -- i keep forgetting i 'm not in kansas . 
to oz ? 
oh -- well -- you 're not starting out very well . 
i do n't blame you for that . 
but maybe you 'd better not .   i 've got a witch mad at me and you might get into trouble . 
i could n't say .   but even if he did n't you 'd be no worse off than you are now . 
um - hmm . 
that 's where i live .   and i want to get back there so badly i 'm going all the way to emerald city to get the wizard of oz to help me . 
um - hmm . 
wonderful !   why if our scarecrow back in kansas could do that the crows'd be scared to pieces ! 
no no -- i -- i just thought you hurt yourself . 
oh !   oh !   ohhh ! 
oh -- does it hurt you ? 
... yes . 
oh well here -- let me help you . 
... do n't talk . 
then close your eyes and tap your heels together three times . 
are you ready now ? 
whenever you wish . 
toto too . 
you do n't need to be helped any longer . you 've always had the power to go back to kansas . 
it 's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the yellow brick road . 
well then you 'll have to walk .   the munchkins will see you safely to the border of munchkinland .   and remember never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment or you will be at the mercy of the wicked witch of the west . 
oh very good but very mysterious .   he lives in the emerald city and that 's a long journey from here . did you bring your broomstick with you ? 
no -- that 's true . the only person who might know would be the great and wonderful wizard of oz himself ! 
pooh -- what a smell of sulphur !   i 'm afraid you 've made rather a bad enemy of the wicked witch of the west .   the sooner you get out of oz altogether the safer you 'll sleep my dear . 
that was her sister -- the wicked witch of the east . this is the wicked witch of the west .   and she 's worse than the other one was . 
the little people who live in this land -- it 's munchkinland and you are their national heroine my dear .   it 's all right -- you may all come out and thank her . it 's all right now - you may all come out . 
the munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the wicked witch of the east . 
well i 'm a little muddled .   the munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the wicked witch of the east .   and there 's the house and here you are and that 's all ... 
oh !   well .... 
are you a good witch or a bad witch ? 
oh rubbish !   you have no power here . be gone before somebody drops a house on you too . 
it 's too late !   there they .... 
... ting the ruby slippers ? 
leave her alone ! 
so isnt it time you unwrapped your present ? 
we cant . 
but what if ... 
what kind of bikes did you ride ? 
do you know what youre doing ? 
hes going to insert the plutonium . 
is there another way ? 
the king pipeline . 
but why ? eight million people would die the land irradiated for a hundred years . a cloud of radiation the size of europe ... 
not just nuclear . powered by a nuclear reactor .   hes not loading any cargo . they want the sub . the sub itself . put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor : instant catastrophic meltdown . 
what is it ? 
what would she want with weapons grade plutonium ? 
elektra king ?   are you insane ?   this is her pipeline . 
whos she ? 
what the hell are you talking about ? 
what the hell were you doing ?   you nearly killed us ! 
its a bomb alright . were still dead if the trigger charge goes off ... 
the plutonium is missing .   theyve taken the core ! 
when this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens . 
they wont get far . every warhead has a locator card .   a miratom device .   emits a high - pitched signal on russian emergency frequencies . we can track the bomb . 
so who are you ? 
he is an impostor .   theres no davidov at miratom . 
the soldiers may give you a hard time . whatever . if we werent around theyd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides rotting in the sun . 
what happened to len tashka ? 
doctor . jones . christmas jones . no jokes ive heard them all . 
you new ? 
what class sub does your nephew run ? 
what is this place ? 
oh james . 
know what happens when a man is strangled ? 
it runs in my veins thicker than blood . im going to redraw the map . and when i am through the whole world will know my name my grandfathers name the glory of my people . 
it is my oil !   mine and my familys ! 
he killed me ! he killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom . 
just like you ... only you were even easier . 
since i was a child ive always had a power over men . when i realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers i knew i had to form a new alliance . 
five more turns and your neck will break . 
soon shell be everywhere . 
i could have given you the world . 
you do what you have to do but ive called in m.   shes en route from london even now . 
you knew .   you knew all the time that he was out there that he was coming for me and you lied . you used me you used me as bait . you made love to me -- what to pass the time as you waited for him to strike ? 
how dare you !   how dare you ! that animal ! ?   that monster ! ? he disgusts me ! you disgust me !   so he knew where to hurt you is that it ? you had a sling on your arm at the funeral ! i didnt have to sleep with you to find that out . 
i dont know what youre talking about ! 
are you saying ... renard is the man whos trying to kill me ? 
... what ? 
what are you talking about ? 
whats wrong with you ?   are you crazy ? 
i used my body on the guards .   it gave me control . i got to a gun and i took my chance .   ive never told anyone that . 
you knew when you first saw me .   you knew it would be like this . 
surely you believe in living dangerously . 
you had your chance james . now im looking for a bigger thrill . 
someone wants to kill me id rather die looking him straight in the eye .   what are you doing here ?   looking for a woman a little more your type ? how about that one ? 
vodka martini . 
i dont want to be safe ! 
then take me with you . 
what is it ? 
the way i acted in the snow ... you must think im a coward . 
i know . 
no !   it will cave in ! 
i cant stay here . 
oh my god ... were buried alive ... 
you dont take no for an answer do you ? 
i have to check the upper lines .   gabor will drive you back . 
you are wrong mr. bond . in fact i am the only person who can do it . 
thats every man within a five mile radius .   including you .   thats why youre here isnt it ? you think i cant do it . you think im going to screw up . or get myself killed . 
if youve come here to look after me mr. bond thank you but no thank you .   i have two bodyguards i dont need a third ... 
are you trying to break my heart ? or is it just your way with women ? 
its my fathers pin . he wore it everyday of his life . 
since the kidnapping . why do you ask ? 
my bodyguard . he follows me everywhere . hes decisive vigilant .   and he makes an excellent omelette . 
partially yes . 
god no . all those horrible loved ones and relatives . i dont want to talk to those people . i just want to ... talk to my father .   i loved him .   im not sure he knew that . 
i havent been able to recall a single moment of that day ... until now . 
i met you at my fathers funeral . 
who ?   bond ?   bond is dead . 
now you know how it feels .   to be locked away to wonder if theyre coming for you if anyone will ever come for you . 
is nothing .   his kingdom he stole from my mother . the kingdom i will rightly take back . 
your people ? your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me . you and my father . he didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market . 
could ... could you come ? 
everythings under control up here .   are you ready ? 
no .   it is the beginning . the world will never be the same . 
what do you think ? 
of course ... 
how would you know ? 
what ? ! 
i would like to use the bathroom -- 
why ?   what 's the problem ? 
major adamson i ca n't seem to get in the door . 
jon -- for godšs sake what do you see ? 
jon where are we ? 
jon -- what ? ? 
what -- am i -- 
jon .   if you ever loved me -- if there 's anything human left in you -- then do it . 
you have the power to do it .   i want you to do it .   please . 
then do me a favor .   if the world 's going to end it should n't matter a bit .   i want you to cure me . 
oh god .   i 'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you . 
jon i do not want to hear it . 
i ca n't stand any more of this .   i want to go back .   if i 'm going to die i want to be with -- other people . 
then why do n't you . . . do something about it ! 
then it 's going to happen .   the world 's going to end .   -- and you 've always known . 
but you knew that i 'd -- die . 
yet you must 've known all along that you 'd give me cancer .   just be being with me . 
jon -- there 's something i have to know .   did you love me once ? 
well i just you just said -- do n't act surprised . 
jon does anybody know what the hell you 're talking about ?   dan 's just an ordinary guy but he talks to me .   when he looks at me he 's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms . 
you -- you know about me and dan ? 
this whole place is ticking .   does it -- keep time ? 
jesus jon i nearly choked to -- where are we -- 
jon no -- i ca n't -- 
collect me ? 
. . . and just how would you manage that ? 
mm hmm . 
is it time ?   d'you have to leave for the funeral ? 
blake ?   dead ? 
we 'll tell them what 's happened .   they 'll listen to reason wo n't they -- ? 
dan -- what do we do now ? 
everything 's changed -- 
dan is this -- is this new york ? ? 
where did he go ? 
what was he doing ? 
welcome back night owl . 
will you two lovebirds keep it down ? 
my god !   we bust him out of jail in the middle of a riot and he stops to take a -- 
what 's he doing ? 
. . . what ? ? 
you 're full of yourself .   what are you doing ? 
that 's because -- 
yes you are . 
the costumes .   am i right ? 
they 're practically on us . . . 
missed 'em dan .   you 're aiming high ! 
they 're following us . 
it 's a peace rally .   the ctu 's just opened fire on the crowd . 
do n't look .   turn around . 
god you sound like jon .   -- turn around . 
dan !   the spare costumes !   i ca n't believe you kept them . 
would you want to sit out a war ?   i mean -- what would be left . 
antarctica ? ? 
the owlship .   i ca n't believe it . 
enough is enough daniel .   where exactly are we ? 
i 'm an open target dan .   if you 're with me -- 
i know what you 're thinking .   you 'd be a lot safer if i were n't around . 
ohh .   i could use some dinner .   who was that on the phone ? 
i just realized .   i 'd never seen his face .   i guess it was just a matter of time .   he 's totally -- daniel ? what 's wrong ? 
eight cops ?   oh great .   a jury 's gon na love that . 
pick a record .   i feel like dancing . 
not at all .   you look very -- dashing .   here you pick one . 
i like the way you look .   it 's strange with jon .   he does n't age .   his face does n't change . but you daniel you look . . . 
sure .   it works .   i mean look at this face daniel .   i 'm thirty - eight years old ! 
i 'd say you stalled out about forty years ago .   nellie lutcher -- louis jordan -- i 've never even heard of these people . 
i 'm not his . . . whatever .   okay ?

i 'm gon na take a warm bath and sack out .   -- you 've been really sweet .   sleep tight okay ?

dan what are you so scared of ?   i mean me i 've spent all these years keeping jon together and now that it 's over i feel -- i feel glad .   i 'm finally free to to go out and live my own life and -- 
they 're not following me dan .   i mean -- jon 's gone we 're right on the brink of world war iii .   nobody cares about the watchmen . 
oh yeah .   they gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out .   no expense account .   no place to live . 
that 's the one .   whatever happened to him ? 
hey .   you remember that nut in the hockey mask ?   with the asthma ? what was his name . . . 
of course we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits . 
damn straight . 
okay okay .   you made your choice .   you went underground .   some of us made other choices . 
now wait .   we all had the same option as blake .   it was work for the government or do time . 
dan are you really that paranoid ?   let 's face it eddie blake was no mother teresa . 
jon ? ?   you mean he 's -- 
i do n't know why you 've been keeping me here but you 're in deep shit -- 
am i free to go ? 
that 's it .   this is all a trick is n't it ?   some kind of horrible joke to make me -- 
what does this mean ?   what does it -- 
what are you saying ?   that jon is radioactive ? 
then why do n't you ask him ? ! ? 
i do n't know their real names ! 
i do n't know their real names . 
maybe i 'll do that . 
i suppose i 'm serving my purpose are n't i.   i 'll ring for the guards . 
i know .   i should n't be saying this .   he 's happy he 's content he 's doing his work -- 
stay adrian .   i just -- every once in a while i need to talk to someone human .   he does n't think like we do .   he does n't even feel what we feel .   i mean -- he even scares the research teams . 
adrian !   do n't leave so soon .   i -- 
he 's in by the superaccelerator .   -- let me take your coat . 
do n't rub it in .   i live here . 
what are you doing ? 
i ca n't believe my mission is finally over . i do n't even know what to do with myself . 
by then it 's too late ! the only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water ! the chemicals will break down and dissipate ! 
it 's running three meters down . twenty knots . 
no it 's like a safety . we are going to have to access the manual controls . 
he 's shut out the communication circuit ! 
a piece of shrapnel hit me . 
let me . 
go to the water it 's that way ! 
he owns a big industrial complex on the river . he 'll launch it from there . 
if they launch it i know how to bring it back . 
yorgi and kirill . 
do n't you see x ? for the betterment of humanity he 's going to start world war three . 
what the hell are we doing ? we 're doing all this together trusting each other making plans and we have n't even slept together yet . 
i was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop . they 'll believe me .   i 've been lying for so long one more time wo n't hurt . 
yes i do . you 're right . i ca n't just let him go free . besides i can help you from the inside . 
i must be healthy then because i 'm scared to death . i guess i 'd better get back to yorgi . 
are n't you afraid ? 
they left . to a fortress in the mountains . 
why ? you 're the one who believes in nothing . screw the world or whatever you said . 
no now it 's about us . let 's do something for us before we both get killed . do n't you want to get to bora bora xander ? 
what do we owe our governments ? yours kidnapped you mine abandoned me . 
it does n't matter anymore forget it . 
we 're getting out of this place . we 've done enough . 
i know which cops are good and which are bad . come with me . come on right now . 
i heard you talking . i could tell where you were in the room . 
are you alright ? 
you ca n't it 's too risky . i 'm not much help anyway remember ? 
of course . i 'll do what i can . i have to go before they notice . 
no i guess i 've been no help at all to you . 
i do n't know . eight months ago i stop hearing from my people . no explanation just silence . so i stay and i wait like i was told . soon i 'm in so far they 'd kill me if i left . now every day i get farther and farther away from what i was . i 'm like you said a criminal . 
i 'm a agent as well . kgb . i 've been undercover for over a year . 
there 's something i did n't have time to tell you before . 
no something worse . he says it 's a surprise but i know him . this is his masterpiece . 
i ca n't let this happen . i want you to go out the back . i 'll make up some excuse . 
that 's alright i 'll figure something out . 
jesus christ . you 're going to have to go out the back . the data that you copied with your toy . tomorrow at six o'clock . look it up . we 're taking a trip . be there at six and you 'll have plenty to tell your people . 
there 's no more time for games . they made you . there 's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye . tell me if it 's true . 
they tell me you 're an american agent . 
a beach named x ? that i 'd like to see . 
all i have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts . 
do n't even start . i 'll be honest i do n't trust you . bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true that i want to leave . what can you do about it ? 
you agree with a lot of what he says do n't you . 
whoever sent you knew what they were doing . you and yorgi are practically twins . two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but do n't say much . 
so why do n't you tell me something about who you gather information for . they obviously have very deep pockets . are you from a rival clan ? 
that 's how you eat ? it 's like a gerbil . 
what are you ? 
go to hell ! 
i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
maybe we should start again yes ? i know so little about you except that you 're not what you say you are . 
bullshit . i see you look at everything study everything ask questions . i know exactly what you 're doing . empty your pockets . 
i also remember you drove your car here . who are you really ? make no mistake i will shoot you and not feel bad about it . who are you working for ? 
who are you ? 
do n't even bother x man i 'm not your type . 
i do n't know who you are or where you come from but i do n't like you . you ask too many questions . 
why are you still hanging around ? your business is finished you should go home . 
mind your business . 
go to hell . 
yorgi asked me to . 
so cute . he shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife . 
my goodness a word with four syllables . i should get some ice before your brain gets too hot . 
do you know what a wire transfer is ? 
ten is hardly worth the effort . we 're talking a lousy million five u.s. 
the peace conference ...
